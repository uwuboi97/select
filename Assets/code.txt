"... AT THIS POINT IN TIME I BEGAN TO LIKE THE ART OF THIS VIOLENT PASSION WHICH AGING FAR FROM DECREASING MADE INCREASINGLY EXCLUSIVE.... THIS ILLNESS ADDED OTHER OBSTACLES AND THE HARDEST ONES TO THOSE THAT WERE MY OWN.

AS A WRITER I BEGAN TO LIVE IN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS IN A SENSE THE TERRESTRIAL PARADISE. AS A MAN MY PASSIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN `AGAINST.' THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ADDRESSED TOWARD THINGS BIGGER OR BETTER THAN MYSELF."

THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE VIRTUE OF HUMILITY TRIUMPHS OVER THEM. POOR LITTLE PEOPLE INDEED BUT IN SPITE.

FRAGMENT OF A LETTER ON THE REBEL.
WE ARE VERY FEW. BUT TRUTH COMES BEFORE EFFICACY. WE MUST DEFINE THE LATTER BEFORE WORRYING ABOUT THE FORMER. WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF BEING MILLIONS IF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF OUR "CHURCH" WERE: YOU WILL LIE? THIS DOESN'T MEAN AT ALL THAT EFFICACY HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE. IT HAS A SECOND MEANING. THE SURVIVAL OF TRUTH IS A PROBLEM NO LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE TRUTH ITSELF. IT IS A PROBLEM THAT COMES LATER. THAT IS ALL. YET IT MUST BE RESOLVED.... CHRISTIANS BEGAN BY BEING TWELVE-MARXISTS TWO.

LETTER TO A. MAQUET.
I ADVANCE WITH THE SAME STEPS IT SEEMS TO ME AS AN ARTIST AND AS A MAN. AND THIS IS NOT PRECONCEIVED. IT IS A FAITH I HAVE IN ALL HUMILITY IN MY VOCATION.... MY FUTURE BOOKS WON'T TURN AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. BUT I WOULD LIKE THEM TO SUBJUGATE IT RATHER THAN BE SUBJUGATED BY IT. IN OTHER WORDS I DREAM OF A FREER CREATION WITH THE SAME CONTENTS.... THEN I WILL KNOW IF I AM A TRUE ARTIST.

FEBRUARY 15 1953
DEAR PB.7

I'LL BEGIN WITH THE EXCUSES THAT I OWE YOU FOR FRIDAY. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF A LECTURE ON HOLLAND BUT BECAUSE I WAS SUMMONED AT THE LAST MOMENT TO SIGN BOOKS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE REFUGEES. THIS EXERCISE WHICH I WAS DOING FOR THE FIRST TIME APPEARED TO ME TO BE SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE AND I TRUSTED THAT YOU WOULD FORGIVE ME THIS SNAG. BUT THIS IS NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION CONCERNS THESE RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU CALL DIFFICULT. ON THIS POINT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS EXPRESSED SIMPLY: IF YOU KNEW A QUARTER OF MY LIFE AND ITS OBLIGATIONS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN A SINGLE LINE OF YOUR LETTER. BUT YOU CANNOT KNOW IT AND I NEITHER CAN NOR SHOULD EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. THE "HAUGHTY SOLITUDE" OF WHICH YOU ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS WHO DON'T ALL HAVE YOUR VIRTUES COMPLAIN WOULD BE AFTER ALL IF IT EXISTED A BLESSING FOR ME. BUT THIS PARADISE IS ATTRIBUTED TO ME QUITE MISTAKENLY. THE TRUTH IS THAT I CONTEND WITH TIME AND PEOPLE EVERY HOUR THAT I WORK MOST OFTEN WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING. I DON'T COMPLAIN THOUGH. MY LIFE IS WHAT I'VE MADE OF IT AND I'M THE FIRST ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DISPERSION AND RHYTHM. BUT WHEN I RECEIVE A LETTER LIKE YOURS THEN YES I FEEL LIKE COMPLAINING OR AT LEAST ASKING NOT TO BE SO EASILY CONDEMNED. TO APPEASE EVERYBODY TODAY I WOULD NEED THREE LIVES AND SEVERAL HEARTS BUT I HAVE ONLY ONE WHICH CAN BE JUDGED AND WHICH I OFTEN JUDGE TO BE OF AVERAGE QUALITY. I DON'T HAVE THE MATERIAL TIME NOR THE INNER LEISURE TIME TO SEE MY FRIENDS AS OFTEN AS I WOULD LIKE TO (ASK CHAR WHOM I LOVE LIKE A BROTHER HOW MANY TIMES A MONTH WE SEE EACH OTHER). I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WRITE FOR THE REVIEWS NEITHER ON JASPERS NOR ON TUNISIA NOT EVEN TO CLEAR UP AN ARGUMENT WITH SARTRE. YOU BELIEVE ME IF YOU WANT TO BUT I DON'T HAVE THE TIME NOR THE INNER LEISURE TO BE ILL. WHEN I AM ILL MY LIFE IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND I LAG FOR WEEKS TRYING TO CATCH UP. BUT MOST SERIOUS OF ALL IS THAT I NO LONGER HAVE THE TIME NOR THE RECREATION TO WRITE MY BOOKS AND I SPEND FOUR YEARS TO WRITE WHAT IN FREEDOM WOULD HAVE COST ME ONE OR TWO. INCIDENTALLY FOR SOME YEARS NOW MY WORK HAS NOT FREED ME IT HAS ENSLAVED ME. AND IF I PURSUE IT IT IS BECAUSE I PREFER IT ABOVE ALL ELSE EVEN FREEDOM EVEN WISDOM OR TRUE CREATIVITY AND EVEN YES EVEN FRIENDSHIP. IT'S TRUE THAT I TRY TO ORGANIZE MYSELF TO DOUBLE MY STRENGTH AND MY "PRESENCE" BY UTILIZING TIME ORGANIZING MY DAYS INCREASING EFFICIENCY. I HOPE TO BE UP TO IT ONE DAY. FOR THE MOMENT I AM NOT-EACH LETTER BRINGS THREE OTHERS EACH PERSON TEN EACH BOOK A HUNDRED LETTERS AND TWENTY CORRESPONDENTS WHILE LIFE CONTINUES AND THERE IS WORK THOSE WHOM I LOVE AND THOSE WHO NEED ME. LIFE CONTINUES AND SOME MORNINGS TIRED OF THE NOISE DISCOURAGED BY THE INTERMINABLE WORK TO BE DONE SICK OF THIS CRAZY WORLD WHICH ASSAILS YOU EVEN AS YOU PICK UP THE NEWSPAPER FINALLY SURE THAT I WILL NOT BE UP TO IT AND THAT I WILL DISAPPOINT EVERYONE I WANT ONLY TO SIT AND WAIT UNTIL EVENING ARRIVES. I HAVE THIS DESIRE AND SOMETIMES I GIVE IN TO IT.

CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT B.? OF COURSE YOU DESERVE TO BE RESPECTED AND SPOKEN TO. OF COURSE YOUR FRIENDS ARE AS GOOD AS MINE (WHO ARE NOT AS GRAMMARIAN AS YOU BELIEVE). ALTHOUGH I HAVE TROUBLE IMAGINING (AND THIS IS NOT A POSE) THAT MY RESPECT COULD TRULY MATTER TO SOMEONE IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE MINE. BUT IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM THIS RESPECT INTO AN ACTIVE FRIENDSHIP A TRUE INNER LEISURE WOULD IN FACT BE NEEDED MANY MEETINGS. IT IS THE LUCK OF MY LIFE THAT I HAVE MET MANY QUALITY PEOPLE. BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS CONDEMNS ME TO DISAPPOINT I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS INTOLERABLE TO OTHERS; IT IS INTOLERABLE TO ME. BUT IT IS SO AND IF THEY CANNOT LOVE ME LIKE THIS IT IS NORMAL THAT THEY LEAVE ME TO A SOLITUDE THAT YOU SEE IS NOT AS HAUGHTY AS YOU SAY.

IN ANY CASE I REPLY TO YOUR BITTERNESS WITHOUT BITTERNESS. COMING FROM SOMEONE LIKE YOU LETTERS LIKE YOURS CAN ONLY MAKE ME SAD AND ADD TO ALL THE REASONS I HAVE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS CITY AND FROM THE LIFE I LEAD HERE. FOR THE MOMENT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WHAT I WANT MOST IN THE WORLD IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. THEREFORE I MUST CONTINUE THIS STRANGE EXISTENCE AND I HAVE TO COUNT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME AS THE PRICE-A LITTLE TOO EXPENSIVE IN MY OPINION-THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR HAVING LET MYSELF BE DRIVEN INTO THIS EXISTENCE.

IN ANY CASE FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING DISAPPOINTED YOU AND BELIEVE IN MY FAITHFUL THOUGHTS.

LETTER FROM GREEN. EACH TIME SOMEONE TELLS ME THAT THEY ADMIRE THE MAN IN ME I HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING LIED ALL MY LIFE.

FOR NEMESIS. PARIS JULY 9 '53.
DEAR SIR I'VE TAKEN TIME RESPONDING TO YOUR PLEASANT LETTER. BUT THESE LAST WEEKS PASSED FOR ME LIKE THE WIND. I HOWEVER HAVE BEEN MORE THAN SENSITIVE TO YOUR SYMPATHY AND THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU WISH TO CLEARLY EXPRESS IT TO ME. I HAD LIKED THE VEILED LUSTER OF YOUR POEMS THEIR "LAGOON AND SUN" ASPECT. AND I AM HAPPY TO SENSE MOREOVER YOUR ACCORD.

EXCESS IN LOVE INDEED THE ONLY DESIRABLE BELONGS TO SAINTS. SOCIETIES THEY EXUDE EXCESS ONLY IN HATRED. THIS IS WHY ONE MUST PREACH TO THEM AN INTRANSIGENT MODERATION. EXCESS MADNESS RUIN THEY ARE SECRETS AND RISKS FOR SOME AND ONE MUST SAY NOTHING OF THEM OR AT MOST BARELY SUGGEST.

FOR THIS REASON POETRY IS THE ETERNAL NUTRIENT. ONE MUST ENTRUST IT TO GUARD THE SECRETS. AS FOR US WHO WRITE IN THE LANGUAGE OF ALL WE MUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF WISDOM AND SOMETIMES PRETEND TO BE UNAWARE THAT ONE IS HIGHER. ACCEPT ALL MY BEST WISHES AND CORDIAL GREETINGS.

IF I HAVE ALWAYS REFUSED TO LIE (UNFIT EVEN WHEN I MADE AN EFFORT) IT IS BECAUSE I COULD NEVER ACCEPT SOLITUDE. BUT SOLITUDE SHOULD NOW ALSO BE ACCEPTED.

LIKE AFTER A LONG ILLNESS WHEN SOMEONE WHOM YOU LOVE DIES. AND EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT IT IS AS THOUGH ONE HAD STRUGGLED LONG AND HARD AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN DEFEAT.

FOR CERTAIN MEN IT REQUIRES MORE COURAGE TO FACE A SIMPLE STREET FIGHT THAN TO JUMP IN THE LINE OF FIRE. HARDEST IS TO STRIKE A MAN AND PARTICULARLY TO FEEL THE PHYSICAL HOSTILITY OF ANOTHER MAN.

DISCOVERED THAT HIS FATHER HAD DIED AT A YOUNGER AGE THAN HE HIMSELF WAS AT THAT VERY MOMENT ...

HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE JUDGED (TO TELL THE TRUTH HE JUDGES LITTLE) BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID IT.

TWO CHARACTERS:

1) THE INDIFFERENT ONE: RAISED WITHOUT A FAMILIAL ENVIRONMENT. WITHOUT A FATHER. A SINGLE MOTHER. HE MANAGES ALONE. A LITTLE HAUGHTY ALTHOUGH POLITE. ALWAYS WALKS ALONE. GOES TO BOXING AND SOCCER MATCHES. LIKES ONLY THE PEAK MOMENT. FORGETS THE REST. AT THE SAME TIME BEGS OF OTHERS THE TENDERNESS OF WHICH HE IS INCAPABLE. LIES EASILY BUT HAS TERRIBLE URGES TO TELL THE TRUTH. A LITTLE MONSTROUS. SECRECY UNTIL THE END BECAUSE HE FORGETS MAJOR PARTS OF HIS LIFE SINCE FEW THINGS INTEREST HIM - AN ARTIST BY HIS VERY SHORTCOMINGS.

2) THE OTHER SENSITIVE AND GENEROUS.

THEY MEET. AT THE END (AND IT IS THE SAME) NEXT TO THE MOTHER.

ID. POOR CHILDHOOD. LIFE WITHOUT LOVE (NOT WITHOUT PLEASURES). THE MOTHER IS NOT A SOURCE OF LOVE. CONSEQUENTLY WHAT TAKES LONGEST IN THE WORLD IS LEARNING TO LOVE.

TWO PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER PURELY BY LOOKS (LET'S SAY THE CASHIER AND THE CUSTOMER). WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF THEY TACKLE EACH OTHER. WHAT DOES HE SAY? "DO YOU HAVE TIME?" WHAT DOES SHE SAY HOW DOES SHE RESPOND?

"I'LL SAY THAT I WENT SOMEWHERE."

IN TWO FORCES OF EQUAL TENSION PROGRESS IS AN OPTIMUM BALANCE. IT TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE LIMITS AND SUBJUGATES THEM TO A GREATER GOOD. AND NOT IN A VERTICAL ARROW WHICH WOULD SUPPOSE THAT PROGRESS IS LIMITLESS.

PLAY. WE WAIT FOR HIM. HE RETURNS FROM THE CAMP. HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (BECAUSE HE HAS FAILED: HE NOW KNOWS WHAT A MAN IS).

SCENE WITH HIS WIFE AND IN FRONT OF HER PHILINTE AND G. PHILINTE'S WIFE. "FOR EXAMPLE I SLEPT WITH G.... MOREOVER I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU AND PHILINTE." - PHILINTE: "NO. IT'S NOT THAT G. IS NOT DELECTABLE. AND ALTHOUGH I DO NOT LIKE THE TRUTH I WILL SPEAK IT BY WAY OF EXCEPTION. WHEN I SAW THAT YOU AND G...." - "HOW" - "YES I KNEW IT.

WILL MAKE HER CHAUD-FROID5 FOR YOU. SHE IS UNBEATABLE WHEN IT COMES TO CHAUD-FROID." END OF THE ACT.

ID. FOR EXAMPLE MY SON IS AN IMBECILE - AH! THAT THE SON SAYS - YOU SEE. YOU PROTEST. IT'S THE REACTION OF AN IMBECILE. AN INTELLIGENT MAN ALWAYS ADMITS THE POSSIBILITY-I SHOULD SAY THE PROBABILITY-OF BEING AN IMBECILE IN SOME WAYS. THUS MY SON IS AN IMBECILE (HE LOOKS AT HIM). NOT COMPLETELY HOWEVER. RATHER HE PLAYS STUPID. HE IS CUNNING AND HE KNOWS THAT STUPIDITY HAS ITS ADVANTAGES THAT IT IS THE HEARTH AROUND WHICH SOCIETY WARMS ITSELF.

ID. THE SON BECOMES SOCIAL. "WHEN THE SOCIAL PLAN COINCIDES WITH THE PRIVATE PLAN . . . - YOUR MOTHER WILL BECOME INTELLIGENT? NO BUT ... ONE DOES NOT COVET ANOTHER'S WIFE? - SURELY - WHY YOURS WILL BE PERFECT'? - NO ... - YOU I SEE YOU COMING.

AND TODAY'S WORLD IS COMPOSED FOR THE THREE-QUARTERS THAT ARE PO- LICENIEN OR FOR THE POLICEMEN'S ADMIRERS."

A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS FULL REFUSES MANY ADVANCES. THEN FOR THE SAME REASON HE FORGETS HIS REFUSAL. BUT THOSE ADVANCES WERE MADE BY PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE NOT FULL AND WHO FOR THIS SAME REASON REMEMBER. THE FIRST LATER FINDS HE HAS EN- ENMIES AND IS ASTONISHED BY IT. LIKE THIS ALMOST ALL ARTISTS IMAGINE THEY WERE PERSECUTED. BUT NO ONE RESPONDED TO THEIR REFUSAL AND ONE PUNISHED THEM FOR THEIR EXCESS OF RICHES. THERE IS NO INJUSTICE.6

THE FIRST MAN
PLAN?

1) SEARCH FOR A FATHER.

2) CHILDHOOD.

3) THE YEARS OF HAPPINESS (SICK IN 1938). ACTION AS A HAPPY OVERABUNDANCE. POWERFUL FEELING OF LIBERATION WHEN IT'S OVER.

4) WAR AND RESISTANCE (BIR HAKEIRN AND THE ALTERNATIVE CLANDESTINE NEWSPAPER).

5) WOMEN.

6) MOTHER.

THE INDIFFERENT ONE. A COMPLETE MAN. A HIGH-CALIBER MIND A SKILLFUL BODY BROKEN BY PLEASURES. HE REFUSES TO BE LOVED OUT OF IMPATIENCE AND OUT OF THE EXACT FEELING OF WHAT HE IS. SWEET AND KIND IN ILLEGITIMACY. CYNICAL AND TERRIBLE IN VIRTUE.

HE CAN DO ANYTHING BECAUSE HE HAS DECIDED TO KILL HIMSELF. CYANIDE. THUS HE ENTERS THE RESISTANCE WHENCE EXTRAORDINARY AUDACITY. BUT THE DAY WHEN HE HAS TO HELP HIMSELF TO THE CYANIDE HE ABSTAINS FROM IT.

SEARCH FOR A FATHER.

WHAT THE COLLABORATIONIST LEFT APPROVES OF PASSES OVER IN SILENCE OR CONSIDERS INEVITABLE; IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER:

4) THE POLITICAL ABDUCTIONS.

5) THE NEAR DAILY POLITICAL EXECUTIONS BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN.

THESE THOUGHTS THAT YOU DO NOT SPEAK AND THAT PUT YOU ABOVE ALL THINGS IN A FREE AND BRISK AIR.

IT IS SAID THAT NIETZSCHE AFTER BREAKING WITH LOU ENTERED INTO A FINAL SOLITUDE WALKED AT NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT DOMINATE THE GULF OF GENOA AND LIT IMMENSE FIRES THERE THAT HE WATCHED SMOLDER. I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT OF THESE FIRES AND THEIR GLEAM HAS DANCED BEHIND MY ENTIRE INTELLECTUAL LIFE. SO EVEN THOUGH I'VE SOMETIMES BEEN UNJUST TOWARD CERTAIN THOUGHTS AND CERTAIN MEN WHOM I'VE MET IN THIS CENTURY IT IS BECAUSE I'VE UNWILLINGLY PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THESE FIRES AND THEY WERE PROMPTLY REDUCED TO ASHES.

NIETZSCHE. ONE COULD CLASSIFY RELIGIOUS MEN AS TOP-NOTCH ARTISTS.

NIETZSCHE: DAWN. "NEVER KEEP SILENT NEVER CONCEAL WHAT ONE CAN THINK AGAINST YOUR OWN THOUGHTS. SWEAR IT SOLEMNLY. IT IS THE FIRST ACT OF LOYALTY THAT YOU OWE TO YOUR THOUGHT."

BEYOND ...: "IF ONE HAS CHARACTER ONE HAS IN HIS LIFE A CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCE THAT ETERNALLY RECURS." QUESTION THEN: TO FIND THE EVENT AND GIVE IT ITS NAME.

GENEALOGY ...: "WHOEVER HAS EVER BUILT A NEW HEAVEN HAS FOUND THE NECESSARY POWER FOR THIS ENDEAVOR ONLY AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS OWN HELL."

... "FROM NOW ON SOLITARY I TAKE THE SIDE AGAINST MYSELF AND EVERYTHING THAT IN FACT OPPOSED ME AND MADE ME SUFFER."

UNIQUE AND GIGANTIC GOAL: THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH.

ETERNAL RECURRENCE: EXALT WHAT IS AND ADORE THAT IT RETURNS. (WITHOUT METAPHYSICS IT INDEED REMAINS ONLY THAT.)

NOTE TO LOU (1882). "IN BED. ACUTE CRISIS. I DESPISE LIFE."

NECESSITY OF AN ARISTOCRACY. IN THE PRESENT ONE CAN IMAGINE ONLY TWO OF THEM: THE ONE OF INTELLIGENCE AND THE ONE OF WORK. BUT INTELLIGENCE ALONE IS NOT AN ARISTOCRACY. NOR WORK (THE EXAMPLES IN BOTH CASES ARE OBVIOUS). ARISTOCRACY IS NOT PRIMARILY THE ENJOYMENT OF CERTAIN RIGHTS BUT PRIMARILY THE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN DUTIES THAT ALONE LEGITIMIZE THE RIGHTS. THE ARISTOCRACY IS ASSERTING ITSELF AND AT THE SAME TIME STEPPING ASIDE. TO LEAVE ONESELF (THE DEFINITION OF DUTY) INTELLIGENCE CANNOT MOVE TOWARD PRIVILEGES. SOME TAKE PART OF INTELLIGENCE OTHERS ARE THE OPPOSITE OF INTELLIGENCE. AND DUTY CONSISTS NEITHER OF ASSERTING ONESELF NOR OF SUPPRESSING ONESELF BUT OF MAKING SURE ONE SERVES WHAT ONE CLAIMS. THUS INTELLIGENCE CAN MOVE ONLY TOWARD THE WORK THAT IS ITS DUTY AND ITS LIMIT. WORK FOR ITS PART CANNOT MOVE TOWARD STULTIFICATION UNCONSCIOUS OR CONSCIOUS (GENERALIZED HUMILIATION OF INTELLIGENCE) WHICH IS EITHER ITSELF OR ITS OPPOSITE (SEE ABOVE). THUS WORK CAN ONLY MOVE TOWARD INTELLIGENCE. FINALLY IN THE PRESENT THE ARISTOCRACIES OF WORK AND INTELLIGENCE ARE NOT POSSIBLE UNTIL THEY RECOGNIZE ONE ANOTHER AND BEGIN TO WALK ONE TOWARD THE OTHER IN ORDER TO ONE DAY ESTABLISH A SINGLE SUPERIOR IMAGE OF MAN.

OBLIGATION TO HIDE A PART OF HIS LIFE GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF VIRTUE.

THE ONLY SOURCE OF ARISTOCRACY IS THE PEOPLE. BETWEEN THE TWO THERE'S NOTHING. THIS NOTHING WHICH FOR 150 YEARS HAS BEEN THE BOURGEOISIE TRIES TO GIVE SHAPE TO THE WORLD AND OBTAINS NIL A CHAOS THAT SURVIVES ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS PAST ROOTS.

NOVEMBER 24. 10:00.
ARRIVAL IN TURIN THIS MORNING.5 FOR SEVERAL DAYS JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF REDISCOVERING ITALY. I HAVE NOT SEEN IT SINCE MY LAST STAY IN 1938. THE WAR THE RESISTANCE COMBAT AND ALL THESE YEARS OF REVOLTING SERIOUSNESS. TRAVELS BUT INSTRUCTIVE AND WHERE THE HEART FALLS SILENT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MY YOUTH A RENEWED STRENGTH AND A LOST LIGHT AWAITED ME IN ITALY. ALSO I WAS GOING TO FLEE THIS UNIVERSE (MY HOME) WHICH FOR A YEAR NOW HAS DESTROYED ME CELL BY CELL; PERHAPS THIS ESCAPE WOULD SAVE ME FOREVER. ACTUALLY YESTERDAY WHEN THE TRAIN STARTED MOVING I WAS NO HAPPIER. TIRED AT FIRST AND THEN THERE WAS THE MEETING WITH GRENIER WHERE I WISHED WE COULD HAVE SPOKEN FREELY BUT WE COULD NOT; EVEN X. COULD NOT HELP ME TO LEAVE CONTENTED. DURING THE NIGHT HOWEVER BETWEEN BRIEF SLUMBERS A HAPPINESS CAME YET STILL REMOTE.

AT 7 O' CLOCK THIS MORNING THE REALIZATION THAT WE ARE IN ITALY. I SHAKE MYSELF AND OPEN THE BLIND: A LANDSCAPE COVERED IN SNOW AND FOG. IT IS SNOWING OVER ALL OF NORTHERN ITALY. ALONE IN MY COMPARTMENT A LAUGHING FIT TOOK HOLD OF ME. IT IS NOT COLD. YET I.A. WHO WAITS FOR ME AT THE TRAIN STATION CLAIMS SHE IS FREEZING TO DEATH. WITH HER PRETTY WAVERING FRENCH AND HER SMALL CALM GRACIOUS GESTURES (SHE REMINDS ME OF MAMAN) BLUSHED FROM THE COLD LIKE A LITTLE SNOW FLOWER SHE RETURNS A LITTLE BIT OF ITALY TO ME. ALREADY THE ITALIANS ON THE TRAIN AND SOON THOSE OF THE HOTEL AS WELL HAVE WARMED MY HEART. PEOPLE WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED AND WHO MAKE ME FEEL MY EXILE IN THE FRENCH PEOPLE'S PERPETUAL BAD MOOD.

FROM MY HOTEL ROOM I CAN SEE THE SNOW CONTINUE TO FALL OVER TURIN. STILL I LAUGH AT MY DISILLUSION. BUT COURAGE RETURNS TO ME.

TURIN BENEATH THE SNOW AND FOG. AT THE EGYPTIAN GALLERY THE MUMMIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM THE SAND WITHOUT WRAPPINGS SHRIVEL FROM THE COLD. I LIKE THE GRAND STREETS PAVED AND WELL SPACED. THIS CITY IS BUILT AS MUCH OF SPACE AS OF WALLS. I AM GOING TO SEE THE HOUSE AT 6 PIAZZA CARLO ALBERTO WHERE NIETZSCHE WORKED BEFORE PLUNGING INTO MADNESS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO READ THE ACCOUNT OF OVERBECK'S ARRIVAL WITHOUT CRYING: HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE ROOM WHERE NIETZSCHE INSANE NOW RAVES AND THEN CRYING THROWS HIMSELF INTO OVERBECK'S ARMS. IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE I TRIED TO THINK OF HE WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED WITH AS MUCH AFFECTION AS ADMIRATION BUT IT WAS IN VAIN. I FIND HIM BETTER IN THE CITY-WHICH I UNDERSTAND HE LOVED DESPITE THE LOW SKY-AND I UNDERSTAND WHY HE LOVED IT.

SHORT STORY. THE CAMP PRISONERS ELECT A POPE CHOOSING FROM THOSE AMONG THEM WHO HAVE SUFFERED MOST DENYING THE OTHER-THE ROMAN-WHO LIVES IN THE LUXURIOUS VATICAN. THEY CALL THEIRS FATHER EVEN THOUGH HE IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST THERE THEY OBEY HIM IN ALL AND WILL DIE FOR HIM UNTIL HE HIMSELF DIES DEFENDING HIS SONS (OR BETTER YET HE REFUSES TO DIE AND PROTECTS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAS OTHERS TO DEFEND AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING).6

LONG WALK IN THE HILLS OF TURIN. IN THE SURROUNDING SKY THE SNOWY ALPS APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR IN THE FOG. THE AIR IS FRESH HUMID AND SMELLS LIKE AUTUMN. THE CITY BELOW IS COVERED IN FOG. FAR FROM EVERYTHING TIRED AND STRANGELY HAPPY. EVENING LECTURE.

I ALWAYS HAVE THIS GRAVE UNBELIEVABLE DEATH ON MY HEART....

RAIN AND FOG ALL OVER PIEDMONT AND LIGURIA. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SNOWFIELDS WE CROSS THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING THE LIGURIAN COAST. FOUR TUNNELS LATER AND THE SNOW DISAPPEARS WHEREAS THE RAIN REDOUBLES ON THE SLOPES DESCENDING TOWARD THE SEA. TWO HOURS AFTER ARRIVAL A LECTURE. DINNER AT THE PALAIS DORIA. THE OLD MARQUISE APPEARS EMACIATED EVERYTHING EXCEPT HER EYES AND HEART. AS I LEAVE I WALK IN A GENOA FINALLY REDISCOVERED WASHED BY VOLUMINOUS WATERS. BLACK AND WHITE MARBLES SHINE LIGHTS FUSE IN THE STREETS LARGE ARTERIES BANAL.

LONG WALK IN GENOA. A FASCINATING CITY AND QUITE SIMILAR TO THE ONE I REMEMBERED.`' SUPERB MONUMENTS ERUPT IN A TIGHT CORSET OF SMALL STREETS CRAWLING WITH LIFE. BEAUTY IS MADE ON THE SPOT HERE RADIATING IN THE LIFE OF EVERYDAY. A SINGER ON THE CORNER OF THE STREET IMPROVISES THE SCANDALS OF CURRENT EVENTS. A SINGING NEWSPAPER.

THE SMALL CLOISTER OF SAN MATTEO. THE WIND DRIVES THE RAIN IN BURSTS ACROSS THE LARGE LEAVES OF MEDLAR TREES. BRIEF INSTANT OF HAPPINESS. LIFE MUST NOW BE CHANGED.

EVENING: DEPARTURE FOR MILAN IN THE RAIN. ARRIVED IN THE RAIN. WHAT STENDHAL LOVED HERE IS QUITE DEAD.

NOVERNBER 29.
LAST SUPPER' - VINCI IS DEFINITELY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ITALIAN DECLINE. CLOISTER OF SAN AMBROGIO. LECTURE. IN THE EVENING I TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO ROME EXASPERATED BY THE STUPID SOCIETY LIFE THAT FOLLOWS THE LECTURES. INCAPABLE OF PUTTING UP WITH MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR OF THESE ANTICS. SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

.10.
FINALLY IN THE MORNING PALE BUT DETERMINED SUNSHINE OVER THE ROMAN COUNTRYSIDE. STUPIDLY TEARS COME TO MY EYES. ROME. ANOTHER ONE OF THESE LUXURIOUS HOTELS STUPID LIKE THE SOCIETY THAT MAINTAINS THEM. I'LL MOVE TOMORROW. WITH N. I LOOK AT THE BIRTH OF VENUS. WALK ALONG THE VILLAS BORGHESE AND PINCIO: EVERYTHING IS PAINTED ON THE SKY WITH A BRUSH OF RARE BRISTLES. I SLEEP. LAST LECTURE. FREE AT LAST. DINNER WITH N. SILONE2 AND CARLO LEVI.3 TOMORROW WILL BE GOOD.

DECEMBER 1ST TO THE 3RD.
THERE ARE CITIES LIKE FLORENCE SMALL TUSCAN OR SPANISH CITIES WHICH CARRY THE TRAVELER SUPPORT HIS EVERY STEP AND RENDER THOSE STEPS LIGHTER. OTHERS LIKE NEW YORK WEIGH ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CRUSH HIM SUCH THAT HE MUST LEARN LITTLE BY LITTLE TO STAND UP AND TO SEE.

THIS IS HOW ROME WEIGHS BUT WITH A SENSITIVE AND LIGHT WEIGHT: ONE CARRIES IT ON THE HEART LIKE A CORPUS OF FOUNTAINS GARDENS AND CUPOLAS ONE BREATHES BENEATH IT A LITTLE OPPRESSED BUT STRANGELY HAPPY. THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL CITY BUT FROM AN AERIAL PERSPECTIVE IT OCCASIONALLY BREAKS OUT AT THE TURNING OF A STREET THIS SENSITIVE AND LIMITED SPACE BREATHES TOGETHER WITH THE TRAVELER AND LIVES WITH HIM.

LEFT THE HOTEL FOR LODGINGS ON THE VILLA BORGHESE. I HAVE A BALCONY THAT EXTENDS OVER THE GARDENS AND THE VIEW I FOUND THERE WARMS MY HEART EVERY TIME I SEE IT. AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF A CITY WITHOUT LIGHT OF RISING IN THE FOG AMONG THE WALLS I AM CEASELESSLY NOURISHED BY THIS SKY AND THESE LINES OF TREES THAT EXTEND FROM PORTA PINCIANA TO TRINITY DEI MONTI AND BEHIND WHICH ROME ROLLS OUT ITS CUPOLAS AND DISORDER.

EACH MORNING WHEN I GO OUT ON THIS BALCONY STILL A LITTLE DRUNK WITH SLEEP THE BIRDS' SONG SURPRISES ME COMES TO FIND ME AT THE BOTTOM OF MY SLUMBER AND COMES TO TOUCH A PRECISE PLACE THAT IN A SINGLE STROKE RELEASES A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS JOY. FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER HAS BEEN NICE AND THE BEAUTIFUL DECEMBER LIGHT BEFORE ME OUTLINES THE CURLED-UP CYPRESSES AND PINES.

HERE I REGRET THE DARK AND DERISORY YEARS I HAVE LIVED IN PARIS. THERE IS A REASON OF HEART THAT I NO LONGER WANT BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL TO NO ONE AND PUTS ME A HAIR'S BREADTH FROM MY OWN LOSS.

THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY ON THE FORUM-IN THE PART THAT IS BADLY RUINED (CLOSE TO THE COLISEUM) NOT IN THIS EXTRAVAGANT FLEA MARKET OF PRETENTIOUS COLUMNS FOUND UNDER CAMPIDOGLIO-THEN ON THE ADMIRABLE PALATINE HILL WHERE NOTHING EXHAUSTS THE SILENCE THE PEACE THE WORLD ALWAYS EMERGING AND ALWAYS PERFECT I BEGAN TO REDISCOVER MYSELF. IT IS THIS THAT THE GREAT IMAGES OF THE PAST SERVE WHEN NATURE CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM AND EXTINGUISH THE SOUND THAT LIES DORMANT IN THEM TO GATHER THE HEARTS AND FORCES THAT WILL THEN BETTER SERVE THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE. IT IS FELT ON THE VIA APPIA WHERE EVEN THOUGH I ARRIVED AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON I FELT INSIDE OF ME WHILE I WAS WALKING A HEART SO FULL THAT LIFE COULD HAVE LEFT ME THEN. BUT I KNEW THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE THAT THERE IS A FORCE IN ME THAT MOVES FORWARD AND THAT THIS STOPOVER WOULD YET SERVE PROGRESS. (ONE YEAR I DID NOT WORK I COULD NOT WORK EVEN THOUGH TEN TOPICS WERE WAITING WHICH I KNOW WERE EXCEPTIONAL AND I STILL COULD NOT TACKLE. ABOUT A YEAR SINCE AND I HAVE NOT GONE INSANE.) ONE COULD LIVE WELL IN THIS CLOISTER THIS ROOM WHERE TASSO4 DIED.

PLACES IN ROME. PIAZZA NAVONA. SANT' IGNAZIO AND THE OTHERS. THEY ARE YELLOW. THE FOUNTAIN BASINS ARE A LITTLE PINK BENEATH THE BAROQUE GUSHING OF WATER AND STONES. WHEN ONE HAS BEHELD ALL OR BEHELD IN ANY CASE ALL THAT ONE COULD BEHOLD STROLLING WITHOUT SEEKING KNOWLEDGE IS A PERFECT HAPPINESS.

YESTERDAY DURING THE NIGHT IN FRONT OF SAN PIETRO IN MONTORIO ROME BENEATH ITS FIRES WAS LIKE A HARBOR WHOSE RESTLESSNESS AND NOISE HAD COME TO DIE AT THE FOOT OF THIS SILENT EMBANKMENT WHERE WE WERE.

IT'S A STRANGE AND INSUFFERABLE CERTAINTY TO KNOW THAT MONUMENTAL BEAUTY ALWAYS SUPPOSES SERVITUDE THAT HOWEVER SERVITUDE IS BEAUTY AND ONE CANNOT HELP BUT DESIRE BEAUTY AND ONE CANNOT DESIRE SERVITUDE; SERVITUDE REMAINS NO LESS INTOLERABLE. PERHAPS IT'S FOR THIS THAT I PUT THE BEAUTY OF A LANDSCAPE ABOVE ALL ELSE-IT'S NOT PAID FOR BY ANY INJUSTICE AND MY HEART IS FREE THERE.

DECEMBER 3.
SUPERB MORNING IN THE VILLA BORGHESE. THE LIGHT OF ALGERIAN MORNINGS FLOWS BETWEEN FINE PINE NEEDLES AND CARVES THEM OUT ONE BY ONE. AND IN THE GALLERY5 FULL WITH A FAIRBLOND LIGHT BERNINI AMUSES ME GORGEOUS AND DISCONCERTING WHEN GRACE TRIUMPHS AS IT DOES IN THE HIGHLY SURREALIST APOLLO AND DAPHNE (AS AN ART SURREALISM WAS INITIALLY A COUNTEROFFENSIVE TO THE BAROQUE) HIDEOUS WHEN GRACE DISAPPEARS AS IN THE DISCONCERTING TRUTH UNVEILED BY TIME. A VIBRANT PAINTER ALSO (PORTRAITS).

CORREGGIO'S DANAE AND ESPECIALLY VENUS BLINDFOLDING CUPID BY TITIAN PAINTED AT AGE 90 AND OF TIMELESS YOUTH.

THE CARAVAGGIOS NOT THOSE IN ST. LOUIS OF THE FRENCH6 SEEN IN THE AFTERNOON DEFINITELY SUPERB WITH THE CONTRAST OF THE VIOLENCE AND THE MUTE LAYER OF LIGHT. BEFORE REMBRANDT. ESPECIALLY THE CALLING OF ST. MATTHEW: SUPERB. C.7 POINTS OUT TO ME THE CONSTANCY OF THE THEMES OF YOUTH AND MATURITY. MORAVIA" HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO ME OF THE TYPE OF MAN CARAVAGGIO HAD BEEN: HE COMMITTED SEVERAL CRIMES WAS ROBBED FLEEING TUSCANY AND THEN WAS THROWN ON A BEACH WHERE HE DIED INSANE (1573-1610). MORAVIA ALSO TOLD ME THE TRUE STORY OF CENCI`' ON WHOM HE WANTS TO BASE A PLAY. BEATRICE IS BURIED BENEATH THE ALTAR OF ST. LOUIS OF THE FRENCH. RIOTS IN ROME THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. A FRENCH SANS-CULOTTE PAINTER TAKES PART IN SACKING ST. LOUIS OF THE FRENCH. THE TOMBS ARE OPENED. BEATRICE'S SKELETON IS THERE THE SKULL SPLIT RESTING IN THE CENTER OF THE BODY. THE PAINTER TAKES THE SKULL AND LEAVES PLAYING WITH IT LIKE A BALL. THIS IS THE LAST IMAGE RELATED TO THE TERRIBLE STORY OF BEATRICE CENCI.

AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON I RETURN TO JANICULUM. SAN PIETRO IN MONTORIO. YES THIS HILL IS MY FAVORITE PLACE IN ROME. HIGH IN THE TENDER SKY GROUPS OF STARLINGS LIGHT AS SMOKE TURN IN ALL DIRECTIONS CROSSING EACH OTHER SCATTERING AND THEN GATHERING TO PLUNGE OVER THE PINES WHICH THEY GRAZE BEFORE RETURNING TO THE SKY. WHEN WE GO BACK DOWN WITH N. WE FIND THEM EXHAUSTED IN THE TREES THE PLANE TREES OF TRASTEVERE'S VIALE DEL RE THEIR NUMBERS SO ENORMOUS THAT EACH TREE HUMS AND CRACKLES COVERED WITH MORE BIRDS THAN LEAVES. WHEN EVENING FALLS A DEAFENING CHIRPING COVERS THE NOISES OF THIS POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD MERGES WITH THE SPUTTERING TROLLEYS AND KEEPS ALL OF THE LAUGHING HEADS TURNED UP TOWARD THESE ENORMOUS SWARMS OF LEAVES AND FEATHERS.

THE LARGE BROWN ROMAN WITH THE GENTLE AND NOBLE FACE WITH A DEMEANOR SO SIMPLE AND SO PROUD TAKES CARE OF ME AT THE LODGING HOUSE. SHORT STORY. LOVE WITH THE PAINTER. AND ALL THE NOBILITY ON HIS SIDE.

WRITE A BAROQUE TEXT ABOUT ROME.

DECEMBER 4.
MORNING. BARBERINI PALACE. CARAVAGGIO'S NARCISSUS AND ESPECIALLY THIS MADONNA ATTRIBUTED TO P. DELLA FRANCESCA APPEARS TO ME TO BELONG RATHER TO THE WISPIER MANNER OF SIGNORELLI. ADMIRABLE IN ANY CASE.

LUNCH WITH MORAVIA AND N. AT TIVOLI AND A LONG AFTERNOON IN HADRIAN'S VILLA THE PERFECT LOCATION. SUPERB DAY IT'S TRUE FREE OF CLOUDS AND WITH A ROUND SKY WHOSE SECTIONS DISPERSE AN EVEN AMOUNT OF LIGHT ON THE MAGNIFICENT CYPRESSES AND THE TALL PINES OF THE VILLA. ITS SECTIONS OF TALL RUINED WALL RECEIVE THIS EVEN LIGHT ON THEIR HONEYCOMB SHEATHING AND IN TURN LET ESCAPE SECRETIONS OF HONEYED LIGHT FROM THEIR CEMENT HIVES. HERE I CAN BETTER SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROMAN LIGHT AND OTHERS THAT OF FLORENCE FOR EXAMPLE MORE DIFFUSE SILVERY SPIRITUAL IN SHORT. ROME'S LIGHT ON THE CONTRARY IS ROUND GLEAMING AND SUPPLE. IT MAKES ONE THINK OF BODIES WITH THE OPULENCE OF FELICITOUS FLESH THE SUCCESSFUL LIFE. BACKGROUNDS EVEN MORE SUCCULENT. BIRDSONG AMONG THE RUINS. IN THE FACE OF THIS CURIOUS AND HAPPY PERFECTION THE FEELING THAT ALL IS SAID.

DINNER PIOVENE.1 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIRTY CONVERSATIONS I BEGIN TO GET AN IDEA OF THE TRUE SITUATION HERE. NOT OF OPINIONS BUT OF FACTIONS. FEW LIBERALS MISERY ITS PURPOSE AND LITTLE BY LITTLE A CERTAIN INERTIA.

AT FORTY YEARS OF AGE ONE NO LONGER COMPLAINS OF THE BAD ONE RECOGNIZES IT AND STRUGGLES ACCORDING TO WHAT ONE OWES. ONE CAN THEN OCCUPY ONESELF WITH CREATING WITHOUT FORGETTING ANYTHING.

IN THE LAST JUDGMENT'S MOVEMENT OF ASCENSION ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ALTAR MICHELANGELO'S BODIES HAD TO BE HEAVILY MUSCLED IN ORDER TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF IRRESISTIBLE LIGHTNESS. LIGHT YET HEAVY. THIS IS THE INTRICACY OF ART.

IN THE BORGIA APARTMENTS PINTURICCHIO'S RHETORIC CARRIES A SWORD.

ONE'S HEART ACHES A LITTLE AT THE THOUGHT THAT JULIUS II DESTROYED PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA'S (AND OTHERS) FRESCOES SO THAT RAPHAEL COULD PAINT HIS CHAMBERS; WHAT HAVE THEY PAID FOR THE SUPERB LIBERATION OF ST. PETER?

CARAVAGGIO'S DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS. THE CROSS IS NOT SEEN; DEFINITELY AN EXCEPTIONAL PAINTER.

DECEMBER 6.
GREY DAY. FEVER. I KEEP THE ROOM. SAW MORAVIA IN THE EVENING.

NOVEL.
THE FIRST MAN REPEATS THE ENTIRE JOURNEY IN ORDER TO DISCOVER HIS SECRET: HE IS NOT THE FIRST. EVERY MAN IS THE FIRST MAN NOBODY IS. THIS IS WHY HE THROWS HIMSELF AT HIS MOTHER'S FEET.

DECEMBER 7.
DEPARTING WITH NICOLA AND FRANCESCO. THE ROMAN COUNTRYSIDE. F. IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO REMOVED FROM EVERYTHING WITHOUT CEASING TO BE PRESENT AND HUMAN. THE VILLAGE OF CIRCE.2 ARRIVAL IN NAPLES. LUNCH IN POZZUOLI AT A RESTAURANT THAT IS PADOVANI'S TWIN. IT IS POURING RAIN IN NAPLES WHICH INCREASES MY FEVER. IN THE EVENING THE SKY CLEARS.

DECEMBER 8.
I AWAKEN WITH A SERIOUS FEVER. LAST NIGHT I COULD NOT FINISH THESE NOTES. DESPITE THAT A LONG WALK IN THE "BARRIOS" BEHIND THE RUE SANTA LUCIA. THESE ARE THE SLUMS BEHIND THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES. THE DOOR IS OPEN AND ONE SEES THREE CHILDREN IN THE SAME BED OCCASIONALLY WITH THEIR FATHER NOT AT ALL EMBARRASSED TO LET THEMSELVES BE EXPOSED. ALL OF THIS FLAPPING LINEN GIVES NAPLES AN AIR OF PERPETUAL FESTIVITY THAT COMES AFTER ALL FROM WHAT THE LINEN LACKS AND FROM THE NEED TO WASH IT DAY AFTER DAY. THESE ARE THE FLAGS OF MISERY. N.F. TONIGHT. THEN WE LEAVE IN A DAMP CARRIAGE THAT SMELLS OF LEATHER AND DUNG. THE FRIENDSHIPS OF MEN ALWAYS TASTE GOOD. N. TAKES US TO A NEIGHBORHOOD IN PORTA CAPUANA. MAIN STREET CLIMBS UPWARD. ON EVERY BALCONY LAMPS ARE POSED WITH THEIR LAMPSHADES AND THIS GIVES TO THAT MISERY AN EXTRAORDINARILY FESTIVE AIR. THERE IS A KIND OF PROCESSION IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH. FLAGS WAVE ABOVE THE PACKED CROWD THAT TRAMPLES IN THE THICK MUD OF CABBAGE DEBRIS LEFT BY THE MORNING MARKET. AND ESPECIALLY THE FIRECRACKERS IN ALL THE SAINTS' BEHINDS; THE VIRGIN ANNOUNCES HERSELF BY BACKFIRING. IN ONE WINDOW A DEMENTED PERSON EYES FIXED IGNITES DOZENS OF FIRECRACKERS WITH THE SAME MECHANICAL GESTUREONE AFTER THE OTHER-WHICH HE THEN HURLS INTO THE CROWD AND AROUND WHICH THE CHILDREN DANCE IN A RING LIKE THE SIOUX UNTIL THEY EXPLODE. THE HOSTELRY OF THE POOR. THEY HAVE OUTDONE THEMSELVES. THIS IS THE ESCURIAL OF MISERY.

DECEMBER 8.
IN BED ALL DAY WITH A FEVER THAT WON'T LET UP. ULTIMATELY I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO PAESTUM. RETURN TO ROME AT THE FIRST SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT THEN PARIS THAT'S ALL. THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN THE GREEK TEMPLES AND ME: AT THE LAST MOMENT SOMETHING ALWAYS INTERVENES THAT PREVENTS ME FROM GOING TO THEM.'

INCIDENTALLY THIS TIME THERE IS NO MYSTERY. THIS EXHAUSTING YEAR HAS BROUGHT ME TO MY KNEES. THE HOPE OF RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND RETURNING TO WORK WAS PURELY SENTIMENTAL. INSTEAD OF RUNNING TOWARD A LIGHT THAT I CAN BARELY TASTE I WOULD DO BETTER AFTER ALL TO SPEND A YEAR REBUILDING MY HEALTH AND WILLPOWER. BUT FOR THAT I WOULD HAVE TO FREE MYSELF A LITTLE FROM ALL THAT WEIGHS DOWN ON ME. THOSE ARE THE THOUGHTS OF BED AND FEVER AND OF A TRAVELER CLOISTERED WITH NAPLES SURROUNDING HIM. BUT THEY ARE TRUE THOUGHTS. FORTUNATELY I SEE THE SEA FROM MY BED.

F'S PAINTER FRIEND EXTREMELY IGNORANT AND HAVING TO ILLUSTRATE THE PASSION OF ST. MATTHEW FOR A RADIO PROGRAM MAKES A SAINT SURROUNDED BY PRETTY WOMEN AND MOCKING ANGELS.

I)ERENIBER 9.
UPON WAKING THE FEVER HAS DISAPPEARED. BUT STIFF IN THE JOINTS AND PUNCH-DRUNK. HOWEVER I DECIDE TO GO (AS EVERY TIME I DRAW ENERGY FROM RECOGNIZING WORSE SITUATIONS: PRISONERS ETC.). WE LEAVE IN A BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINE. SORRENTO (AND THE DELECTABLE COCUMELLA GARDEN) AMALFI A LITTLE TOO DECORATIVE WHERE WE LUNCH THEN I DRIVE TO RELIEVE F. WHO IS TIRED AND THE SUN SETS WHEN AFTER HAVING CROSSED AN INDUSTRIAL REGION AND THEN A CURIOUS GROUND THAT MAKES ME THINK OF LIMBO (LARGE REEDS SKELETAL AND BARE) WE ARRIVE AT PAESTUM. HERE THE HEART FALLS SILENT.

(LATER.) AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON I WANT TO TRY TO RELIVE THIS ARRIVAL. WE ARE WELCOMED AT AN INN CLOSE TO THE RUINS BY A NICE OLD ROOM WITH THREE BEDS AND ENORMOUS BLEACHED WALLS RUSTIC BUT OF UNQUESTIONABLE CLEANLINESS. A DOG STICKS CLOSE TO ME. THE SUN SETS AS THE GATES BEING CLOSED WE CLIMB THE RAMPARTS TO ENTER THE FIELD OF RUINS. LIGHT STILL COMES FROM THE QUITE CLOSE BLUE SEA BUT THE HILLS THAT FACE THE SEA ARE ALREADY BLACK. WHEN WE ARRIVE BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF POSEIDON THE ALREADY SLEEPING CROWS RISE UP IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TUMULT OF WINGS AND CRIES THEN FLY AROUND THE TEMPLE FALL TO THE FOUR CORNERS AND SET OUT AGAIN LIKE A SALUTE TO THE ADMIRABLE BEING OF STONE NONETHELESS ALIVE AND UNFORGETTABLE APPEARING BEFORE OUR EYES. THE HOUR THE BLACK FLIGHT OF CROWS THE BIRDS' RARE SONGS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE HILLS AND ONE RETAINS THESE EXACT AND WARM WONDERS; ALL OF THIS IN MY FATIGUE AND EMOTION PUTS ME A HAIR'S BREADTH AWAY FROM TEARS. THEN THE INTERMINABLE RAPTURE WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS SILENT.

EVENING SILENCE CROWS LIKE THE BIRDS OF LOURMARIN AND THE CAT MY TEARS MUSIC.

IN THE MORNING IN TIPASA THERE IS DEW ON THE RUINS. THE WORLD'S YOUNGEST FRESHNESS ON WHAT IS MOST ANCIENT. THEREIN LIES MY FAITH AND IN MY OPINION THE PRINCIPLE OF ART AND LIFE.

DECEMBER 10.
LAST NIGHT WALK TOWARD THE BEACH AMONG THE REEDS RAMPARTS AND BUFFALOES. THE IMMENSE AND MUTED SOUND OF THE SEA WHICH INTENSIFIES LITTLE BY LITTLE. THE BEACH TEPID WATER UNDER THE NIGHT'S GREY AND LUMINOUS SKY. ON THE WAY BACK IT RAINS A LITTLE AND THE SOUND OF THE SEA DIES DOWN BEHIND US. THE BUFFALOES MOVE GENTLY LOWERING THEIR HEADS STILL AS THE NIGHT. GENTLENESS.

I FALL ASLEEP AFTER HAVING GAZED THROUGH MY WINDOW AT THE TEMPLES IN THE NIGHT. THE ROOM WITH THE THICK AND NAKED WALLS THAT I LIKE SO MUCH IS FREEZING COLD. COLD ALL NIGHT. I OPEN MY WINDOWS; IT IS RAINING ON THE RUINS. AN HOUR LATER AT THE TIME WE ARE TO LEAVE THE SKY IS BLUE THE LIGHT FRESH AND MAGNIFICENT. ENDLESS AMAZEMENT BEFORE THIS TEMPLE OF ENORMOUS SPONGE PINK COLUMNS GOLDEN CORK ITS ETHEREAL IMPRESSION ITS INEXHAUSTIBLE PRESENCE. OTHER BIRDS HAVE MIXED WITH THE CROWS BUT THE LATTER STILL COVER THE TEMPLE WITH A BLACK VEIL FLAPPING IN ALL DIRECTIONS EMITTING RAUCOUS CRIES. THE FRESH SMELL OF THE SMALL HELIOTROPES WHICH COVER THE TEMPLE'S SURROUNDINGS.

NOISES: THE SOUND OF WATER DOGS A DISTANT VESPA.

IT IS NOT THE MELANCHOLY OF RUINED THINGS THAT BREAKS THE HEART BUT THE DESPERATE LOVE OF WHAT LASTS ETERNALLY IN ETERNAL YOUTH: LOVE OF THE FUTURE.

STILL IN THE RUINS BETWEEN THE HILLS AND THE SEA. DIFFICULT TO PULL MYSELF AWAY FROM THESE PLACES THE FIRST SINCE TIPASA WHERE I HAVE KNOWN AN ABANDONMENT OF ALL BEING.

DECEMBER 10.
FOLLOW-UP. WE LEAVE NEVERTHELESS AND A FEW HOURS LATER POMPEII. INTERESTED OF COURSE BUT NEVER TOUCHED. THE ROMANS ARE SOMETIMES REFINED NEVER CIVILIZED. LAWYERS AND SOLDIERS WHOM WE CONFUSE GOD KNOWS WHY WITH THE GREEKS. THEY ARE THE FIRST THE TRUE BURGLARS OF THE GREEK MIND. ALAS CONQUERED GREECE DID NOT CONQUER THEM IN TURN. EVEN THOUGH THEY BORROWED THE THEMES AND FORMS OF THE GRAND ART THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE COLD APPROXIMATIONS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF NOT MAKING SUCH THAT THE GREEK NAIVETE AND SPLENDOR WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO US WITHOUT INTERMEDIARY. COMPARED WITH HERA OF PAESTUM'S TEMPLE ALL THE ANTIQUITY THAT COVERS ROME AND ITALY SHATTERS TO PIECES AND WITH IT A COMEDY OF FALSE GRANDEUR. BY INSTINCT MY HEART HAS ALWAYS KNOWN THIS MY HEART WHICH HAS NEVER BEATEN FOR A SINGLE LATIN POEM (NOT EVEN VIRGIL IS ADMIRED NOR LOVED) AND WHICH HAS ALWAYS ACHED FOR THE FLASH OF A TRAGIC STANZA OR LYRIC HAILING FROM GREECE.

RETURNING TO THIS PRECIOUS BUCHENWALD THAT IS POMPEII THE TASTE OF ASH AND FATIGUE GROWS. WE DRIVE ALTERNATING WITH F. AND AT 9:00 P.M. I ARRIVE IN ROME EXHAUSTED.

DECEMBER 11.
ALMOST THE ENTIRE DAY IN BED. CONTINUOUS STATE OF FEVER MAKES EVERYTHING TASTE BLAND TO ME. REGAIN HEALTH AT ALL COST. I NEED MY STRENGTH. I DO NOT NEED LIFE TO BE EASY FOR ME BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MATCH MYSELF UP TO IT IF IT IS DIFFICULT BEING IN COMMAND OF WHETHER I WANT TO GO WHERE I AM GOING. WILL LEAVE TUESDAY.

DECEMBER 12
A NEWSPAPER FALLS INTO MY HANDS. THE PARISIAN COMEDY THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN. THE JOKE OF GONCOURT. THIS TIME THE MANDARINS.4 IT APPEARS THAT I AM THE HERO. IN FACT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN A SITUATION (THE DIRECTOR OF A NEWSPAPER ORIGINALLY FROM THE RESISTANCE) AND ALL THE REST IS FALSE: THOUGHTS FEELINGS AND ACTIONS. BETTER: THE QUESTIONABLE ACTS OF SARTRE'S LIFE ARE LIBERALLY HEAPED ON MY BACK. GARBAGE ANYWAY. BUT NOT INTENTIONALLY JUST SORT OF AS ONE BREATHES.

IMPROVED STATE. GREY DAY. IT RAINS ON ROME WHOSE WELLWASHED CUPOLAS SPARKLE SLIGHTLY. LUNCH AT F.G. EVENING ALONE FEVER PAST.

DECEMBER 13.
MORE CARAVAGGIO. SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO. ROME'S SADNESS IS ALSO WITH ITS STREETS WHICH ARE TOO HIGH AND TOO TIGHT. THIS IS WHY PLACES THERE ARE SO BEAUTIFUL: THEY DELIVER; THE BAROQUE THEN TRIUMPHS OVER THE ROMAN. LIKE ITS ROMAN COUPLES FROZEN IN STONE WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT THAT THEY STAND VERY STRAIGHT. THE TWILIGHT HOUR THAT SLIPS INTO THE PALACE AND COLLAPSES THE PROUD FACADE. IN THE EVENING M. TALKS TO ME ABOUT BRANCATI5 AND HIS DEATH. DINNER ALONE.

DECEMBER 14. DEPARTURE.
EXISTENTIALISM. WHEN THEY ACCUSE THEMSELVES ONE CAN BE SURE THAT IT IS ALWAYS TO CRUSH OTHERS. JUDGE-PENITENTS.6

WITH LUKE TRUE TREASON BEGINS CAUSING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JESUS' DESPERATE DYING CRIES.

M. TO WHOM I SAY THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ROLES THAT ASK OF THE ACTOR ONLY VIRTUOSITY AND IN WHICH THE ACTOR CAN EXPERIENCE HIS METIER AND HIS MASTERY TELLS ME THAT THIS DOES NOT INTEREST HER THAT SHE DOES NOT LIKE TO PLAY CHARACTERS SHE CANNOT MARRY AND LIVE AND FEEL HERSELF THEN LIVING ANOTHER LIFE THROUGH. AND SHE CONCLUDES: "I LIKE TO PERFORM BECAUSE I AM ROMANTIC."

MORALS. NOT TO TAKE WHAT ONE DOES NOT DESIRE (DIFFICULT).?

I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED TO BECOME BETTER. I HAVE ALWAYS DECIDED TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO THIS END. WHETHER I HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IT IS ANOTHER QUESTION.

FOR ME WAS MARRIAGE NOT A MORE CIVILIZED SENSUAL ADVENTURE? IT WAS THAT.

IF I BLOOM SHE WILTS. SHE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT LEANING ON MY BLOSSOM. THUS WE ARE TWO OPPOSING POLES OF PSYCHOLOGY.

THE OPPOSITE OF THE SUBTERRANEAN MAN: THE MAN WITHOUT RESENTMENT. BUT THE CATASTROPHE IS THE SAME.

THIS WORLD WIGGLES QUITE A BIT BECAUSE LIKE A CUT WORM IT HAS LOST ITS HEAD. IT SEARCHES FOR ITS ARISTOCRATS.

LA MARTINIERE THE WHITE BOAT THAT TRANSPORTED THE PRISONERS TO CAYENNE-AND MADE A STOPOVER IN ALGIERS TO LOAD NEW CARGO ON BOARD (MY REPORTAGE" ON A DAY OF POURING RAIN-THE BOAT COVERED WITH SHAVEN CONVICTS-THE INTERIOR TWO CAGES ETC. - THE SAME TRIP THAT I MADE BUT IN A COMFORTABLE CABIN) - A STORY?

THE FIRST MAN. AMBITION MADE HIM LAUGH. HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE HE DID NOT WANT TO POSSESS HE WANTED TO BE. FOR THAT ONLY OBSTINACY.

FROM THE MOMENT THE PRIVATE LIFE IS THROWN ON DISPLAY EXPLAINED TO SO MANY PEOPLE IT BECOMES THE PUBLIC LIFE AND IT IS VAIN TO HOPE TO MAINTAIN IT.

THIS LIFE (EMPTY) OF CITIES AND UNBEARABLE DAYS WITHOUT LOVE.

FOR TEN YEARS IT IS WHAT HAS INTERESTED ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD.

THE FIRST MAU. "AND THINKING OF ALL THAT HE HAD DONE WITHOUT REALLY WANTING TO THAT OTHERS HAD WANTED-OR MORE SIMPLY BECAUSE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES OTHERS HAD DONE THINGS THIS WAY-ALL OF WHICH NONETHELESS ACCUMULATED IN THE END TO FORM A LIFE THE ONE HE SHARED WITH ALL MEN WHO ULTIMATELY DIE WITHOUT HAVING KNOWN HOW TO LIVE THE LIFE THEY REALLY WANTED TO LIVE."

THE FIRST MAIL. THEME OF ENERGY. "I WILL CONQUER BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING. COMPROMISE HYPOCRISY BASE DESIRE OF POWER ALL OF THAT IS TOO EASY. BUT I WILL TRULY DOMINATE WITHOUT MAKING A MOVEMENT TO POSSESS OR TO HAVE."

THE ONLY LAW OF BEING IS TO BE AND TO TRANSCEND ONESELF.

.IONAS. THE CONCIERGE BESIDE HERSELF (HER SON DIED): "AH! MONSIEUR JONAS YOU UNDERSTAND DON'T YOU!" AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD: "DON'T GO SEE MONSIEUR JONAS HE BEATS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN."

THE FIRST MATT. THEME OF FRIENDSHIP.

M. WITHOUT MUCH CULTURE AND ENTERING FULL-ON INTO THE MASTERWORKS. INCAPABLE OF DAWDLING WITH MEDIOCRITY EVEN OUT OF LAZINESS AND DISCERNING GREATNESS BY INSTINCT.

THE FIRST MAN. THEME OF ANGUISH. (CF. CONNAISSANCE DE L'HOMME.`' ADLER P. 156). CHARACTER MOTIVATION: DESIRE FOR POWER PSYCHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING.

DON FAUST (OR DOCTOR TENORIO): "I NEVER ASKED ANYTHING FOR WHAT I GAVE I NEVER SPOKE OF WHAT I DID I CONSIDERED MYSELF TOO SMALL FOR NEVER HAVING GIVEN QUITE ENOUGH AND I THOUGHT MAINLY OF ALL THAT I'D NEVER GIVEN. BUT TODAY I NEED THE LITTLE THAT I'VE DONE; I NEED THOSE WHO ARE HERE. THOSE TO WHOM I'VE NEVER REFUSED MY HAND NOR MY HELP THEY WHO SPEAK AND TESTIFY IN MY FAVOR. ALL ARE SILENT. THEN IT IS I WHO WILL SPEAK. THIS ONE . . ." (REBELLIOUS TEXT).

FIRST MAN. WITH SIMONE. FOR ONE YEAR HE CANNOT TAKE IT. AND THEN AVOIDANCE. SHE CRIES AND THIS TRIGGERS EVERYTHING.

EVERYTHING COMES FROM MY CONGENITAL INABILITY TO BE BOURGEOIS AND A CONTENTED BOURGEOIS. THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF STABILITY IN MY LIFE TERRIFIES ME.

IN THE END MY GREATEST ADVANTAGE OVER THE DISINGENUOUS IS THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE. I HOLD HORROR AND DISTASTE FOR DEATH BUT I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

TREASON OF THE LEFT-WING INTELLECTUALS. IF THEIR TRUE GOAL IS TO PRESERVE THE U.S.S.I .'S REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLES WHILE PROGRESSIVELY CORRECTING ITS PERVERSIONS WHAT REASON WOULD THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAVE TO RENOUNCE ITS TOTALITARIAN METHODS IF IT KNOWS IN ADVANCE THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS BE EXCUSED? IN TRUTH ONLY THE FRANK OPPOSITION OF THE WEST'S LEFTISTS CAN MAKE THIS GOVERNMENT RECONSIDER ASSUMING IT CAN OR WANTS TO. BUT IN TRUTH OUR INTELLECTUALS' TREASON IS STILL EXPLAINED BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN STUPIDITY.

WHY WEAKNESS IN THE FACE OF PLEASURE WOULD BE GUILTIER THAN WEAKNESS IN THE FACE OF PAIN. WEAKNESS IS SOMETIMES RESPONSIBLE FOR INCOMPARABLE DEVASTATION.

DON FAUST. 1ST SCENE OR PROLOGUE - FAUST ASKS TO KNOW ALL AND HAVE ALL. "THUS I WILL GIVE YOU SEDUCTION" THE DEVIL SAYS. AND FAUST BECOMES DON JUAN.

LAST SCENE. HE HAS TO PAY. "LET'S GO." NO THE DEVIL SAYS HE MUST COME AGAINST HIS WILL OTHERWISE HE DIES SIMPLY. "DIE SIMPLY THEN" (HERE A CHORUS OF MEN WELCOME THE HERO AMONG THEM - BETTER LATE THAN NEVER).

R.IT.A.II THE HAPPINESS OF THIS SIMPLE FRIENDSHIP THAT I HAVE LIVED.

FEBRUARY 26.
WHEN THE OLD QUEEN HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO THE YOUNG QUEENS THEY KILL HER OR DRIVE HER OUT. AND ON THE EDGE OF THE HIVE SHE DIES OF HUNGER.

THIS RIDICULOUS PARADE OF LOVE AND ITS ABOMINABLE DEMANDS THANKS TO WHICH THE WEAK AND VULGAR HELP EACH OTHER TO LIVE AND TO APPEAR.

APRIL 26.
DEPARTURE FROM PARIS.7 HEARTBROKEN AND EMPTIED OF ANY JOY BY X. THE ALPS. AND THE ISLANDS THAT COME ONE BY ONE TO MEET US ON THE SEA: CORSICA SARDINIA IN THE DISTANCE ELBA AND CALABRIA. CEPHALONIA AND ITHACA ARE ALMOST INVISIBLE IN THE TWILIGHT. THEN THE GREEK COAST BUT AT NIGHT PELOPONNESUS'S MUSCULAR HAND BECOMES A DARK AND MYSTERIOUS CONTINENT COVERED WITH SNOWDROP WHERE HERE AND THERE THE SNOW-COVERED PEAKS SHINE. A FEW STARS IN THE STILL ILLUMINATED SKY AND THEN A CRESCENT MOON. ATHENS.

27.
AWAKENING WIND CLOUDS AND SUN. SOME ERRANDS. MY CHARMING 21-YEAR-OLD TRANSLATOR WITH A YOUTHFUL GLOW (I TOLD YOU I WAS CLOSE TO THE HOTEL BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE AND I RAN THE WHOLE WAY SO AS NOT. TO BE LATE WHICH IS WHY I AM OUT OF BREATH) WHO WINS ME OVER AND WHOM I ADOPT.

ACROPOLIS. THE WIND HAS CLEARED ALL THE CLOUDS AND THE WHITEST MOST NATURAL LIGHT FALLS FROM THE SKY. ALL MORNING THE STRANGE FEELING OF HAVING BEEN HERE FOR YEARS MOREOVER OF BEING AT HOME WITHOUT EVEN BEING BOTHERED BY THE LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES. WHILE CLIMBING THE ACROPOLIS THIS IMPRESSION INCREASES WHEN I NOTICE THAT I GO THERE "AS A NEIGHBOR" WITHOUT AN EMOTION.

UP THERE IT'S ANOTHER THING. OVER THE TEMPLES AND THE GROUND STONE WHICH THE WIND SEEMS TO HAVE ALSO STRIPPED TO THE BONE THE ELEVEN O' CLOCK LIGHT FALLS FULLY BOUNCES SHATTERS INTO THOUSANDS OF WHITE AND SEARING SWORDS. THE LIGHT DIGS INTO THE EYES CAUSES THEM TO WELL UP ENTERS THE BODY WITH A PAINFUL SPEED EMPTIES IT OPENS IT TO A SORT OF FULL PHYSICAL VIOLATION CLEANSES IT AT THE SAME TIME.

HELPED BY HABIT THE EYES OPEN LITTLE BY LITTLE AND THE EXTRAVAGANT (YES IT'S WHAT STRIKES ME THERE THE EXTRAORDINARY AUDACITY OF THIS CLASSICISM) BEAUTY OF THE PLACE IS RECEIVED IN A PURIFIED BEING CLEANED WITH THE LIGHT'S CRESOL.

THEN THE DARK RED POPPIES I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE ONE OF WHICH GROWS DIRECTLY ON A BARE STONE ALONE THE [...]8 THE MAUVES AND MARKED BY THE PERFECT VANTAGE POINT SPACE ALL THE WAY TO THE SEA. AND THE FACE OF THE SECOND KORE STATUE ON THE ERECHTHEION THE BENT LEG OF THE THIRD ...

HERE ONE FIGHTS AGAINST THE IDEA THAT PERFECTION WAS REACHED THEN AND THAT THE WORLD HAS NOT. CEASED TO DECLINE SINCE. BUT THIS IDEA ENDS UP CRUSHING THE HEART. IT IS AGAIN AND ALWAYS NECESSARY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT. WE WANT TO LIVE AND TO BELIEVE THAT IS TO DIE.

AFTERNOON HYMETTUS A VIOLET COLOR. PENTELI.

7 P.M. LECTURE. DINNER AT A TAVERNA IN THE OLD QUARTER.

28.
MORNING. WITH MARGARITA LIBERAKI.9 DAPHNI. BUT BYZANTIUM DEFINITELY.... THE PLACE IS CHARMING. IN ELEUSIS ONE MUST HAVE A LOT OF IMAGINATION. BUT THE FIELDS BEFORE AND AFTER ELEUSIS ARE QUITE BEAUTIFUL. IN THE TEMPLE TWO PATHS LEAD TO THE SANCTUARY AND THE SECOND IS DEVIATED SUCH THAT EVERYTHING IS OUT OF THE VIEW OF THE UNINITIATED.

VITAL IMPORTANCE OF WHAT I KNOW OF ELEUSIS. TO DEVELOP.

ADMIRABLE PIECES AT THE MUSEUM.

LUNCH AT THE EMBASSY. TIEMPO PERDIDO.'

AFTERNOON. AGORA. THESEION. AREOPAGUS; IN AGORA'S SMALL MUSEUM STATUES OF HERAKLEION ATHENA HERCULES. HERCULES IS KNOTTY AND HARD BENEATH THE FLOWERY HONEYSUCKLES THAT COVER HIM. THEN I GO UP ON THE HILL OF THE MUSES. THE SUN LOW ON THE HORIZON IS NOT YET THE RED COLOR THAT WILL DRAW IT PERFECTLY IN THE CLEAR SKY. BUT IT IS NO LONGER INTENSE: IT WANES AND LOSES ITS FORM. THEN FROM ITS BROKEN CIRCUMFERENCE ESCAPES A SUBTLE HONEY THAT SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE SKY GILDS THE HILLS AND THE ACROPOLIS AND COVERS THE SCATTERED CITY BLOCKS WITH A SOFT AND UNIQUE SPLENDOR WHICH REACHES OUT TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE HORIZON ALL THE WAY TO THE SEA.

I RETURN JUST IN TIME FOR MY CONTROVERSIAL LECTURE. AFTER TWO HOURS OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS I LEAVE FATIGUED. DINNER IN PIRAEUS WITH MARGARITA LIBERAKI. CURIOUS BEING: SECRETIVE AND GRIM WITH SUDDEN BURSTS OF LIFE AND LAUGHTER.

29.
MORNING. NATIONAL MUSEUM. IT CONTAINS ALL THE WORLD'S BEAUTY. I KNEW THE KORE STATUES WERE GOING TO TOUCH ME BUT THE WONDERMENT WITH WHICH THEY'VE LEFT ME LASTS STILL. I AM ALLOWED TO VISIT THE CELLARS WHERE THEY KEPT SOME OF THEM DURING THE WAR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE INVASION AND DESTRUCTION. AND THERE IN THE CELLAR WHERE HISTORY HAS THROWN THEM THEY STILL SMILE UNDER THE DUST AND STRAW THAT COVERS THEM AND THIS SMILE OVER TWENTY-FIVE CENTURIES STILL WARMS INFORMS AND ENCOURAGES. FUNERARY STELES TOO AND REPRESSED GRIEF. ON A BLACK AND WHITE LEKYTHOS THE INCONSOLABLE DEAD CANNOT RESIGN THEMSELVES TO NEVER SEEING THE SUN AND SEA AGAIN. I LEAVE UNHAPPY AND A LITTLE DRUNK WITH THIS PERFECTION.

THEN I LEAVE FOR SOUNION. THE MIDDAY LIGHT IS STILL SLIGHTLY SHROUDED CARRYING AN INVISIBLE MIST IN THE AIR BUT I ADMIRE THE SPACE AND VASTNESS OF THESE LANDSCAPES HOWEVER REDUCED. AS WE APPROACH SOUNION THE LIGHT BECOMES FRESH AND YOUTHFUL. THEN ON THE CAPE AT THE FOOT OF THE TEMPLE THERE IS NOTHING BUT WIND. THE TEMPLE ITSELF LEAVES ME COLD. THIS MARBLE TOO WHITE HAS THE APPEARANCE OF STUCCO. BUT THE PROMONTORY-WHERE IT RISES AND MOVES INTO THE SEA LIKE A POOP DECK FROM WHICH ONE CONTROLS THE SQUADRON OF OFFSHORE ISLANDS WHILE IN BACK ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT THE SEA FOAMS ALONG THE FLANKS OF SAND AND ROCKS-THIS IS AN INDESCRIBABLE PLACE. THE FURIOUS WIND WHISTLES SO STRONGLY IN THE COLUMNS THAT ONE WOULD BELIEVE ONESELF TO BE IN A LIVELY FOREST. IT SWIRLS THE BLUE AIR SUCKS UP THE FRESH SEA WIND VIOLENTLY BLENDS WITH THE FRAGRANCE RISING FROM THE HILL COVERED IN MINISCULE FRESH FLOWERS AND FURIOUSLY WITHOUT TRUCE SNAPS WOVEN BLUE CLOTHS OF AIR AND LIGHT AROUND US. SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE TEMPLE TO SHELTER OURSELVES FROM THE WIND; THE LIGHT IMMEDIATELY CLEARED IN A SORT OF IMMOBILE GUSH. THE ISLANDS DRIFT IN THE DISTANCE. NOT A SINGLE BIRD. THE SEA FOAMS SOFTLY ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON. PERFECT MOMENT.

PERFECT EXCEPT FOR THIS ISLAND ACROSS FROM MAKRONISOS2 EMPTY TODAY IT'S TRUE BUT IT WAS ONCE A DEPORTATION ISLAND OF WHICH I'M TOLD TERRIBLE TALES.

ALL THE WAY AT THE BOTTOM ON THE SMALL BEACH WE HAVE A LUNCH OF FISH AND CHEESE IN FRONT OF THE LARGE FISHING BOATS IN THE SMALL PORT. TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON THE COLORS DARKEN THE ISLANDS SOLIDIFY THE SKIES LIGHTEN. THIS IS THE PERFECT MOMENT OF LIGHT OF ABANDON WHERE ALL IS WELL. BUT BECAUSE OF MY LECTURE I MUST LEAVE. I TEAR MYSELF FROM THESE PLACES WITH SADNESS AND I NEVER LEAVE THEM COMPLETELY.

BUT ON THE PROMONTORY AGAIN BEFORE TAKING TO THE ROAD ONE SEES MAKRONISOS. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TRIP BACK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LIGHT THAT I HAVE HAD HERE OVER THE FIELDS OF OLIVE TREES FIG TREES WITH PARTICULARLY GREEN LEAVES RARE CYPRESSES AND EUCALYPTI.

LECTURE. DINNER WHERE I OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE DEPORTATION. THE FIGURES SEEM TO AGREE. THE NUMBER OF DEPORTEES WAS REDUCED TO 8 OR 900. IT IS WITH THIS THAT I SHOULD BE OCCUPIED.

30.
NATIONAL MUSEUM. AGAIN I GO TO SEE THE LARGE AND LEAN KOUROS STATUES. REPETITION OF HECUBA. EXCEPT ONE THESE YOUNG GREEK GIRLS LACK GRACE AND STYLE. DINNER IN KIFISSIA; BENEATH THE SOFT LIGHT THE GARDEN RESONATES WITH THE NIGHTINGALES' SONG.

AFTERNOON. WORK THEN THE HILL OF THE MUSES. THIS TIME THE SUN IS CLOSE TO SETTING. AGAIN A SORT OF HILARIOUS JOY BEFORE THE EXTRAORDINARY AUDACITY OF THE ACROPOLIS WHERE THE ARCHITECTS PLAYED NOT WITH HARMONIOUS MEASURES BUT WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE CAPES OF THE ISLANDS THROWN ON THE IMMENSE GULF AND OF A VAST SWIRLING CONCH-SHELL SKY. IT IS NOT THE PARTHENON THAT THEY BUILT BUT THE SPACE ITSELF AND WITH A DELIRIOUS VIEW. OVER THIS ENTIRE SQUADRON OF ISLANDS AND PEAKS DOMINATED BY THE ROCK'S POOP DECK THE APPEASEMENT OF NIGHT FALLS SUDDENLY AND [. . .]`; ON A NOISELESS NAVIGATION.

INSERTED LETTER.
MY DEAR X.

MY CURRENT SILENCE INTERESTS ONLY ME. IT TOUCHES TOO MANY PARTS OF MY PERSONAL LIFE FOR ME TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. NONETHELESS YOU WILL BE DELIGHTED TO KNOW THAT IF I HAD SPOKEN I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHAT YOU HOPE FOR I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THAT PLEASURE TO ANYONE. BESIDES THE CAUSE THAT INTERESTS YOU DOES NOT LACK APPOINTED LAWYERS (I RECOGNIZE MOREOVER THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN VERY VIGOROUS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE). BUT YOUR LETTER PUSHES ME TO SAY ONE THING THAT I'VE WANTED TO SAY TO YOU FOR A LONG TIME NOW. NAMELY THAT IN THE GRAND CONFLICT THAT CUTS THE XXTH CENTURY IN TWO YOU HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN.

FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THAT EAST GERMANY HAS BEEN REARMED FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OLD NAZI GENERALS ARE ACTIVE THERE JUST LIKE IN THE WEST. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE U.S.S.R. HAS RECOGNIZED GERMANY'S RIGHT TO HAVE NATIONAL FORCES. YOU SAY NOTHING OF THIS. IT IS BECAUSE YOU ACCEPT THIS REARMAMENT IF IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE U.S.S.R. BUT YOU REFUSE IT WITHIN A WESTERN FRAMEWORK. AND IT IS LIKE THIS WITH EVERYTHING. IN EXTREME CASES (ASK YOURSELF) YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE TRANSFORMATION OF FRANCE INTO A POPULAR DEMOCRACY UNDER THE RED ARMY'S PROTECTION (AND I REMIND YOU THAT I DEFENDED-ME-THE COMMUNISTS AGAINST ALL "ATLANTIZATION" OF DOMESTIC POLICY). EVERY TIME THAT YOU SPOKE OR WROTE TO ME OF THESE PROBLEMS YOUR IMPLICIT OPINION WAS OBVIOUS YOUR INDIGNATION ONLY SINCERE IN THE FACE OF ROSENBERG-TYPE CRIMES' BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ABOUT THE REPRESSION OF A WORKER'S REBELLION IN GERMANY COURTESY OF A COMMUNIST REGIME THIS CREATED A SORT OF SILENCE IN YOU FILLED WITH DOUBTS (THIS LAST POINT IS IMPORTANT AND IT SEEMS TO ME A PAINFUL BUT DECISIVE TEST OF LEFT-WING INTELLECTUALS).

THUS IN MY OPINION YOU HAVE CHOSEN. AND SINCE YOU HAVE CHOSEN IT IS NORMAL THAT YOU ENTER THE COMMUNIST PARTY. IT IS NOT I WHO WILL REPROACH YOU FOR IT. I DON'T HAVE CONTEMPT FOR COMMUNIST ACTIVISTS ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THEM TO BE MAKING IT FATAL ERROR. I HAVE AN EXCESS OF CONTEMPT FOR THE INTELLECTUALS WHO ARE NOT REALLY INTELLECTUALS WHO MURDER US WITH THEIR PSEUDO-RIPPING OF SECULAR PRIESTS AND WHO FINALLY GIVE THEMSELVES A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WORKING ACTIVISTS.

THEN ONCE AND FOR ALL DO WHAT YOU WISH TO DOSTRAIGHTEN YOURSELF OUT WITH YOURSELF. YOU'LL SEE THEN. YOU CONSTANTLY COMPARE TWO THINGS OF WHICH YOU ONLY KNOW AND JUDGE ONE-THE SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE-AND YOU IGNORE THE OTHER. THE COMMUNIST PARTY WILL NOT HELP YOU KNOW POPULAR DEMOCRACY. FAR FROM IT. BUT IT WILL HELP YOU KNOW COMMUNISM OF WHICH YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE. IF YOU FIND PEACE THERE A RULE OF LIFE THIS WILL BE ALL FOR THE BETTER. IF NOT AT LEAST YOU WILL HAVE FOUND THERE A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTION.

SOLELY TO AVOID ANY ERROR I REPEAT TO YOU WHAT I BELIEVE. GERMAN REARMAMENT MUST BE CONDEMNED IN BOTH CASES OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS A DECEPTION. AND IF I CONTINUE TO FIND HELPING FRANCO OR THE "FRUIT-BEARING" POLICY IN SOUTH AMERICA OR COLONIALISM INEXCUSABLE I DO NOT ACCEPT THE FRUITBEARING POLICY GRAFTED ON FRANCE COURTESY OF RUSSIA AND ITS UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORTER: THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY. IN GENERAL I REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVES AND METHODS OF WHAT I'VE CALLED CAESARIAN SOCIALISM.

BESIDES THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. MY BOOKS HAVE SIMPLY MEANT MUCH LESS TO YOU THAN YOU SAY. YOUR SYMPATHY FOR ME WAS MORE REAL. BUT THE ONE WHO ENTERS INTO RELIGION HE ALSO LOVED HIS FRIENDS AND HIS MOTHER AND YET HE ABANDONS THEM. FOR I CANNOT LET YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU ARE NOT ENTERING A CHURCH THE SECOND YOU CHOOSE AN ORTHODOXY LIKE THAT OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. DO NOT DOUBT BUT ON THE CONTRARY RECOGNIZE IN YOUR HEART THAT COMMUNIST TEMPTATION IS FOR AN INTELLECTUAL OF THE SAME NATURE AS RELIGIOUS TEMPTATION. THERE IS NOTHING SHAMEFUL IN IT PROVIDED THAT ONE LOYALLY SUBMITS WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS. AS FOR ME YOU MAINTAIN EVEN FROM AFAR MY FRIENDSHIP. I ONLY ASK THAT IF YOU TAKE ACTION ON YOUR PROJECT WHEN YOU HEAR THAT I AM OBJECTIVELY AS ONE SAYS A DREADFUL FASCIST DON'T DENY IT WHICH WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT TRY NOT TO THINK IT. GOOD LUCK FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART AND BELIEVE IN MY FAITHFUL THOUGHTS.

THE POPULAR EVENING DANCES AT "JOHNNY LE FOU. I MAKE AN EFFORT TO FIND THESE DANCES INTERESTING BUT THE DANCERS PARTICULARLY THE FEMALE DANCERS ARE TOO UNATTRACTIVE.

MAY 1.
EARLY MORNING DEPARTURE FOR ARGOLID. THE CORINTHIAN GULF COAST. A SHIMMERING LIGHT ETHEREAL AND JUBILANT INUN DATES THE GULF AND OFFSHORE ISLANDS. STOPPED A MOMENT AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THE SEA'S ENTIRE IMMENSITY AHEAD OF US OFFERED IN A SINGLE BEND LIKE A CAESURA WHERE WE DRINK THE LIGHT AND AIR IN LONG GULPS.

AFTER AN HOUR ON THE ROAD I AM LITERALLY DRUNK WITH LIGHT HEAD FULL OF FLASHES AND SILENT CRIES; WITHIN THE HEART'S DEN AN ENORMOUS JOY AN INTERMINABLE LAUGHTER THAT OF KNOWLEDGE AFTER WHICH ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND EVERYTHING IS ACCEPTED. DESCENT ON MYCENAE AND ARGOS. THE MYCENAEAN FORTRESS IS COVERED WITH THICK BUNCHES OF POPPIES WHICH TREMBLE BENEATH THE WIND ABOVE THE ROYAL TOMBS. (EVERY PART OF GREECE I HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH IS AT THIS MOMENT COVERED WITH POPPIES AND THOUSANDS OF FLOWERS.) ABOVE THE FORTRESS THE PLAIN STRETCHES UP TO ARGOS AND THE SEA. AGAMEMNON'S KINGDOM IS NO BIGGER THAN TEN KILOMETERS AND YET THE PROPORTIONS ARE SUCH THAT NEVER HAS A MORE IMMENSE KINGDOM EXTENDED UNDER THE SUN. MYCENAE-SUNK BETWEEN ITS TWO HIGH BOULDERS SURROUNDED BY ENORMOUS BLOCKS BENEATH A LIGHT THAT BECOMES FRIGHTFUL HERE-IS TODAY THE SAVAGE QUEEN OF THIS UNFORGETTABLE LAND.

THE RUINS OF ARGOS ARE WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST FOR ME. THE YOUNG ARCHAEOLOGIST GEORGES ROUX VAUCLUSIAN SO ALIVE SO IMPASSIONED BY HIS BEAUTIFUL TRADE HE INTERESTS ME QUITE A BIT. I ENVY HIM A LITTLE AND BITTERLY REPROACH MYSELF FOR THE WASTED TIME OF THESE LAST YEARS AND FOR MY PROFOUND FAILURE. WE LUNCH IN ASINI AND BEFORE THE LUNCH I SWIM IN A CRYSTALLINE AND COLD WATER ON THE BEAUTIFUL BEACH.

IN THE AFTERNOON IN EPIDAURUS THE MAY 1ST FESTIVAL HAS BROUGHT A KERMIS OF JOYOUS GREEKS. BUT FROM ABOVE THE THEATRE IN A THICK AND TEPID LIGHT THAT SPILLS OVER THE SLOPES OF OLIVE TREES EUCALYPTI [... ]'~ AND ACACIAS EVERY SOUND RESONATES IN A SORT OF VAST AND GENTLE DISAFFECTION. ONLY THE WEAK BELLS OF SHEEP HERDS MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD ABOVE THE OTHER SOUNDS BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME DISAFFECTION. HERE THE HOUR IS STILL PERFECT.

SOIREE. NAFPLION BEFORE THE SEA AT THIS HOUR WHICH THE GREEKS CALL THE ROYALTY OF THE SUN AND WHICH IS THE HOUR OF CRIMSON IN THE SKY OF MAUVES AND BLUES DEPOSITED ON THE MOUNTAINS AND BAYS.

MAY 2.
DEPART FOR SPARTA IN THE MORNING BENEATH A FORMIDABLE SKY. EACH WIDE VALLEY CONSTITUTES A KINGDOM OF OLIVE TREES AND MAJESTIC CYPRESSES AND MOUNTAINS EVERY SO OFTEN A VILLAGE-GREECE IS DESERTED HERE-ONLY THE PINK GREEN AND RED PAINTED HERDS OF SHEEP TRAVEL IT. OVER THE PLAIN OF EVRO- TAS SPARTA BENEATH THE SNOWY TAYGETUS STRETCHES ITS FIELDS OF ORANGE TREES THEIR ABUNDANT PERFUME NO LONGER LEAVING US. OVER THE RUINS OF MYSTRAS FLIGHTS OF TURTLEDOVES. A TRANQUIL MONASTERY WITH WHITEWASHED WALLS OPENED OVER THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF LACONIA TO THE WELL-ROUNDED AND WELLSEPARATED OLIVE TREES SHIVERING BENEATH A TIRELESS SUN.

UPON RETURNING THE DESCENT ON NAFPLION ITS GULF THE ISLANDS AND THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE. STOP IN ARGOS WITH THE YOUNG ARCHAEOLOGISTS DOING THE EXCAVATIONS. SAME IMPRESSION AS IN FRONT OF THE SMALL GROUP OF ARCHITECTS WHO REBUILD ORLEANSVILLE AND LIVE THERE IN A COMMUNITY. I HAVE ONLY BEEN HAPPY AND AT PEACE IN A TRADE A JOB ACCOMPLISHED WITH OTHER MEN WHOM I CAN LIKE. I DO NOT HAVE A TRADE BUT ONLY A VOCATION. AND MY WORK IS SOLITARY. I MUST ACCEPT IT AND TRY ONLY TO BE WORTHY OF IT WHICH IS NOT THE CASE AT THIS MOMENT. BUT I CANNOT PROTECT MYSELF FROM A FEELING OF MELANCHOLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE MEN WHO ARE HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY DO.

WE RETURN TO MYCENAE; THE SUN HAS JUST GONE DOWN AT THE MOMENT WE REACH THE HIGHEST TERRACE. BETWEEN THE STEEP PEAKS WHICH DOMINATE IT A TRANSPARENT MOON SOFTLY SAILS. BUT ACROSS FROM US THE DARKENED PLAIN EXTENDS FROM THE FOOT OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS OF ARGOS ALL THE WAY TO THE BRIGHTER SEA ON OUR RIGHT. THE SPACE IS IMMENSE THE SILENCE SO ABSOLUTE THAT THE FOOT REGRETS HAVING CAUSED A STONE TO ROLL. A TRAIN CHUFFS IN THE DISTANCE ON THE PLAIN A DONKEY BRAYS AND THE SOUND RISES UP TO US THE HERDS' BELLS RUSH DOWN THE SLOPES LIKE A WHISPER OF WATER. ON THIS WILD AND TENDER SETTING [...1- IS MAGNIFICENT. OVER THE NOW BLOOMING POPPIES A LIGHT WIND PASSES VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVENING IN THE WORLD SETS LITTLE BY LITTLE OVER THE MYCENAEAN LIONS. THE MOUNTAINS DARKEN LITTLE BY LITTLE UNTIL THE TEN CHAINS WHICH ARE REFLECTED ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON BECOME A SINGLE BLUE VAPOR. IT WAS WORTH THE GRIEF OF COMING FROM SO FAR TO RECEIVE THIS GRAND BIT OF ETERNITY. AFTER THIS THE REST IS NO LONGER IMPORTANT.

MAY .3.
WORK IN THE MORNING. DEPART FOR DELPHI AT ONE P.M. ALWAYS THE SAME LIGHT BUT THIS TIME OVER LESS CONSIDERABLE HEIGHTS STONY WITHOUT A TREE. IT'S AT THIS POINT THAT ONE REALIZES GREECE IS PRIMARILY A SPACE MADE OF CURVED OR STRAIGHT LINES BUT ALWAYS SHARPLY CONTOURED. THE ENTIRE EARTH OUTLINES THE SKY AND GIVES IT ITS FORM BUT THE SKY IN TURN WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT THESE RELIEFS WHOSE HARMONIOUS CLOSURE ORGANIZES ITS OWN SPACE. THIS IS WHY EVERY MILE HAS DIVIDED THIS PLACE INTO THE GRAND KINGDOMS: THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IS DOUBLE THAT OF THE SKY. ARRIVE IN A SORT OF BASIN A SINGLE CLOUD THAT WE WATCHED SWELL FOR SOME TIME NOW BURSTS AND BLUSTERS IN ONLY SECONDS. SOLID HAILSTONES POUND THE CAR WITH A DEAFENING SOUND. FIVE MINUTES LATER OUT OF THE BASIN WE ONCE AGAIN FIND THE SKY CLEAR AND CARRY ON CHEERFULLY.

DELPHI. INITIALLY MOST STRIKING ABOUT THE GRANDEUR OF THE SITE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE IMMENSE VALLEY THIS MURKY GREEN RIVER WHICH PUSHES ITS MUSCULAR HINDQUARTERS [...]8 TOWARD THE SEA. THE OLIVE TREES ARE PACKED SO TIGHTLY ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THAT SEEING THEM FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY MAKE ONLY ONE QUIVERING PATH TOWARD THE HORIZON. AS FOR THE RUINS THE STORM WHICH HAS ALSO FALLEN ON DELPHI HAS WET THEM. THEY APPEAR MORE ALIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORE VIVACIOUS FLOWERS AND GREENER GRASSES. A BLACK EAGLE SAILS VERY HIGH FOR A FEW SECONDS AND DISAPPEARS. THEN THE DAY LIGHTENS AND FROM THE HIGH CLIFFS A TRANQUILITY THAT ANNOUNCES THE NIGHT BEGINS TO FALL. RETURN TO THE STADIUM FROM WHICH I LEAVE HAPPY.

EVENING. IN A BOUZOUKIA`' FOUR GREEKS KINDLY INVITE ME TO DANCE. BUT THEIR STEPS ARE TOO DIFFICULT. IF I HAD THE TIME FOR IT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN. FROM MY ROOM THE VALLEY FILLS WITH SHADOWS ALL THE WAY TO THE SMALL STRAND OF LIGHTS THAT BORDER THE SEA. SURROUNDED BY FILMY SCARVES THE MOON PLACES A FINE POWDERY LIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND SHADED HOLLOWS. THE SILENCE VAST AS SPACE IS GOOD.

MAY 4.
DEPART IN THE MORNING FOR VOLOS. ROUGH MOUNTAINS THEN THE PLAIN OF LAMIA. MORE MOUNTAINS SOFTER GREENER BENEATH THE RISING SUN-AND THIS IS THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF THESSALY. THE VLACHS' PRIMITIVE HUTS-AND THE IMMENSE EXPANSE. THE EAST IS NOT FAR. VOLOS. 80% OF THE HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OR KNOCKED DOWN. THE ENTIRE CITY IS UNDER TENTS. THE SUN WEIGHS ON THE CLOTHS AND THE DUSTY CITY. FEW OR NO BATHROOMS. I WONDER HOW THEY AVOID EPIDEMICS. FRENCH LYCEE UNDER THE TENTS. AND THE SEA QUITE CLOSE SLICK AND COOL AT THE EDGE OF THE RUINED CITY. THE MAYOR RECEIVES ME IN THE COURTYARD NEAR THE RUINED HOUSE. INTELLIGENT AND ELEGANT CHARACTER. DUE TO AN OFFHAND REMARK A HAIRDRESSER ARRIVES AND CUTS MY HAIR IN THE COURTYARD IN FRONT OF EVERYONE WITH THE MOST CHARMING FAMILIARITY. STILL IN THE CITY. THE MASS CELEBRATED OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL TENT ETC. RETURN TO LARISSA BY CAR. RAILCAR. LARISSA TO SALONICA. DURING THE NIGHT WE TRAVEL PARALLEL TO THE SEA GLISTENING BENEATH THE MOON. ARRIVAL 11:00 TTTIT.

MAY 5.
WORK. LUNCH WITH TURNER AND COLONEL BRAMBLE' (OR SOMEONE WHO STRONGLY RESEMBLES HIM). BYZANTINE CHURCHES. THE SMALL CONVENT WITH THE PEACOCKS. ST. DAVID ST. GEORGES. ST. DIMITRIU. THE TWELVE APOSTLES (ST. SOPHIE OF NO INTEREST). I AM NOT VERY TOUCHED BY BYZANTINE ARTONE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE IT THOUGH-BUT INTERESTED IN THIS EVOLUTION THAT GOES FROM THE VTH TO THE XIITH CENTURY AND WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO RECONSTITUTE A LINK BETWEEN THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD AND THE QUATTROCENTO. FOR EXAMPLE THE MOSAICS AND FRESCOS OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES ARE FAR FROM THE STIFFNESS AND HIERATICISM OF THAT ART'S FIRST CENTURIES. THERE ONE FINDS THE BEGINNINGS OF DUCCIO. A LITTLE LATER (IN THE EVENING) I QUESTION A SPECIALIST WHO TEACHES ME THAT THE BYZANTINE ARTISTS EMIGRATED TO ITALY AFTER THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPLE.

LITTLE BY LITTLE THE EASTERN INFLUENCE WILL BE ELIMINATED IN THIS WAY.

EVENING. LECTURE. AM TOUCHED BY A REGISTERED GIRL.2 RECEPTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. DURING THE NIGHT I REST ON MY ROOM'S BALCONY TO GAZE AT THE PORT THE CAIQUES THE SEA'S FLOWERY QUAY AND TO BREATHE THE BEAUTIFUL SCENT OF SALT AND THE NIGHT.

MAY 6 7 8.
LUNCH WITH T. IN FRONT OF THE SEA ATOP A CLIFF. THE HOUR IS PLEASANT. AFTERWARD T. PLAYS ME THE LATEST COMPOSITIONS. I MUST LEAVE. PLANE. THE SPORADES DRIFT OFF BELOW US IN THE GLITTERING SEA. DINNER MERLIER.33 AT MIDNIGHT D. COMES TO GET ME AND WE LEAVE FOR PIRAEUS WHERE M. ALGADES AND HIS ATTRACTIVE CUTTER AWAIT US. GOOD-NATURED MAN DELIGHTED AND CORDIAL. WE LEAVE PIRAEUS UNDER AN ASHEN MOON THAT ILLUMINATES THE SEA WITH A HOT IRREAL LIGHT. I AM HAPPY TO FEEL THE WATER HITTING THE HULL AND TO SEE AGAIN A LIGHT FOAM SLIPPING BY BOTH SIDES OF THE SHIP'S STEM. BUT AFTER A MOMENT WE SEE THE FOG LITERALLY BEING BORN FROM THE SEA LAYER UPON LAYER THICKENING AND LITTLE BY LITTLE BLOCKING THE HORIZON. IT IS COLD AND DAMP. ALGADES CLAIMS THAT HE HAS NEVER SEEN THIS IN THE ARCHIPELAGO. HE HAS TO REROUTE THE CUTTER TO AVOID TWO SMALL ISLANDS. I GO DOWN TO LIE DOWN. IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP UNTIL SIX A.M. TWO HOURS LATER I AWAKEN AND GO BACK UP ON THE DECK. THE FOG IS STILL THERE. ALGADES AND HIS MARINER KEPT WATCH ALL NIGHT OUT OF FEAR OF RUNNING AGROUND. BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SUN RISES SHOWS ITSELF PALE BREAKS THROUGH THE FOG AND FINALLY DISPELS IT. AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK WE MOVE (WITHOUT SAILS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WIND) ON A MOTIONLESS SEA IN A GLITTERING AND DELICATE LIGHT. THE AIR IS SO LIMPID IT SEEMS THAT THE LEAST NOISE COULD BE HEARD FROM THE FAR END OF THE HORIZON. THE SUN WARMS THE DECK AND ITS HEAT RISES LITTLE BY LITTLE. THEN THE FIRST ISLAND APPEARS. WE PASS BETWEEN SE- RIPHOS AND SIFNOS BECAUSE OF THE DETOUR WE MADE. ON THE HORIZON SYROS AND THE OTHER ISLANDS TAKE SHAPE ALL APPEARING LIKE A SKETCH IN THE SKY. ON THE INVERTED HULL OF THE ISLANDS THE SMALL VILLAGES FIXED UPON THE SLOPES LOOK LIKE SHELLS PALLID CONCRETIONS LEFT BY THE RECEDED SEA.

THE SMALL YELLOW ISLANDS LIKE BUNDLES OF WHEAT ON THE BLUE SEA.

WE SAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE DISTANT ISLANDS ON AN ILLUMINATED SEA WHICH GENTLY WRINKLES ITSELF RUNS PARALLEL TO SYROS AT LENGTH; SOON MYKONOS APPEARS AND AS THE DAY ADVANCES IT BEGINS TO BECOME CLEARER ITS SNAKEHEAD THAT BENDS TOWARD DELOS STILL INVISIBLE BEHIND RINIA. THE SUN SETS AS WE FIND OURSELVES NEARLY IN THE CENTER OF A CIRCLE OF ISLANDS WHOSE COLORS BEGIN TO CHANGE. FADED GOLD CYCLAMEN A MAUVE-GREEN THEN THE COLORS DARKEN AND ON THE STILL GLISTENING SEA THE ISLAND MASSES BECOME A DARK BLUE. IT IS A STRANGE AND VAST CALMING THAT THEN FALLS ON THE WATERS. HAPPINESS AT LAST HAPPINESS CLOSE TO TEARS BECAUSE I WISH TO HOLD AGAINST ME TO SQUEEZE THIS INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THAT HOWEVER I KNOW MUST DISAPPEAR. BUT FOR SO MANY DAYS IT LASTS FAINTLY TODAY IT GRIPS MY HEART SO DEFINITELY THAT IT SEEMS TO ME I SHOULD BE ABLE TO REGAIN IT FAITHFULLY EVERY TIME I WISH TO DO SO.

NIGHT HAS FALLEN WHEN WE DESCEND ON MYKONOS. AS MANY CHURCHES AS HOUSES. ALL WHITE. WE WANDER IN THE SMALL STREETS WHERE COLORED BOUTIQUES OPEN. IN THE PITCH-BLACK STREETS WE COME ACROSS THE SCENT OF HONEYSUCKLE. THE MOON SHINES FAINTLY ABOVE THE WHITE TERRACES. WE CLIMB BACK ABOARD AND I LIE DOWN SO HAPPY THAT I DON'T EVEN FEEL MY FATIGUE.

IN THE MORNING A DIVINE LIGHT FALLS ON THE BLEACHED HOUSES OF MYKONOS. WE RAISE THE ANCHOR FOR DELOS. THE SEA IS BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALLINE AND PURE ABOVE THE SEA BED OF WHICH WE ALREADY CATCH SIGHT. WHILE APPROACHING DELOS WE GLIMPSE ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF POPPIES ON THE FIRST SLOPES OF THE ISLAND.

DELOS. THE ISLAND OF LIONS AND BULLS REPRESENTATIONS OF WHICH COVER THIS ISLAND OF ANIMALS BUT ONE MUST ADD SNAKES TO IT [...]4 AND LARGE LIZARDS WITH DARK BODIES BUT LIGHT GREEN AT THE TAIL AND HEAD AND THE DOLPHINS OF THE MOSAICS. THE MARBLE THAT THE LIONS ARE MADE OF IS ERODED AND PITTED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE EROSION SO MUCH SO THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE MADE OF ROCK SALT A LITTLE GHOSTLY THEY GIVE ONE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FIRST RAINS WILL DISSOLVE THEM. BUT THIS ISLAND OF LIONS AND BULLS IS ALSO COVERED WITH THE BROWN AND FRIABLE BONES THAT ARE THE RUINS AND BENEATH THESE BONES SUDDENLY ADMIRABLE AND FRESH DISCOVERIES (MOSAICS OF DIONYSUS AT REST).

THE ISLAND OF RUINS AND FLOWERS (POPPIES CONVOLVULUS WALLFLOWERS ASTERS) ALSO. THE ISLAND OF THE MUTILATED GODS OF THE MUSEUM (LITTLE KORE STATUES). AT NOON CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF CYNTHE AND THE SURROUNDING GULFS THE LIGHT THE REDS AND THE WHITES; THE ENTIRE CIRCLE OF THE CYCLADES TURNS SLOWLY AROUND DELOS ON THE SPARKLING SEA IN ONE MOVEMENT A SORT OF MOTIONLESS DANCE. THIS WORLD OF ISLANDS SO NARROW AND SO VAST APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE HEART OF THE WORLD. AND AT THE CENTER OF THIS HEART STANDS DELOS AND THIS PEAK WHERE I AM FROM WHERE I CAN LOOK BENEATH THE STRAIGHT AND PURE LIGHT OF THE WORLD AT THE PERFECT CIRCLE THAT BORDERS MY KINGDOM.

RETURNED LATER BY ROWBOAT A RAVISHING GREEK TEENAGER DRESSED SIMPLY ON THE QUAY. WHEN THE ROWBOAT LEAVES THE QUAY I WAVE TO HER AND SHE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDS WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE. ON THE CUTTER I UNDRESS AND PLUNGE INTO THE TRANSPARENT GREEN WATER. IT IS ICE COLD AND I CLIMB BACK UP AFTER SOME STROKES. WE RETURN TO MYKONOS. FEELING OF INFINITE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL THE SEA LIKE THIS IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM ONE ISLAND TO THE NEXT. AND A FREEDOM NOT AT ALL LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT THIS WORLD OF ISLANDS HAS BOUNDARIES. ON THE CONTRARY THIS FREEDOM EXULTS IN ITS CIRCLE. FOR ME FREEDOM WOULD NOT BE TO PUNCTURE THIS CIRCLE AND SAIL TOWARD SUMATRA BUT TO GO FARTHER FROM THIS BARE ISLAND TO AN ISLAND OF TREES AND FROM THE ROCK TO AN ISLAND OF FLOWERS.

IN MYKONOS TO SHOP. I PREFERRED THE CITY AT NIGHT. WE RETURN TO SEA LATE. STRANGE SADNESS SO SIMILAR TO THE SADNESS OF LOVE WHILE WATCHING DELOS AND CYNTHE DISAPPEAR LITTLE BY LITTLE BEHIND RINIA. FOR THE FIRST TIME I WATCH A LAND THAT I LOVE DISAPPEARING WITH THE PAINFUL FEELING THAT PERHAPS I WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN BEFORE (LYING. HEARTACHE. THE COLORS AGAIN CHANGE OVER THE SEA AND ISLANDS [...]5 THE SAILS WHICH FLAP SOFTLY WITH A LIGHT WIND. HARDLY HAVE WE TASTED THE PEACE THAT RISES FROM THE SEA TOWARD THE SKY THAT EMPTIES ITS LIGHT LITTLE BY LITTLE AND ALREADY BEHIND A ROCKY ISLE THE MOON RISES. IT RISES RAPIDLY IN THE SKY THEN ILLUMINATES THE WATERS. UNTIL MIDNIGHT I GAZE AT IT I LISTEN TO THE SAILS I INWARDLY ACCOMPANY THE MOVEMENT OF THE WATER ON THE SIDES OF THE SHIP. FREE LIFE OF THE SEA AND THE HAPPINESS OF THESE DAYS. ALL IS FORGOTTEN HERE AND ALL IS REMADE. THESE MARVELOUS DAYS SPENT FLYING ON THE WATER BETWEEN ISLANDS COVERED WITH COROLLAS AND COLUMNS IN A TIRELESS LIGHT; I RETAIN THE TASTE OF IT IN MY MOUTH IN MY HEART A SECOND REVELATION A SECOND BIRTH....

IN THE MORNING HEAD WIND THE SAILS WHIP THE HEEL INCREASES AND WE HEAD FOR PIRAEUS WITH THE LOUD NOISE OF WATER AND FABRIC. RAIN OF LIGHT DROPS OF WHICH FALL AND BOUNCE BACK ON THE MORNING SEA. DESPAIRED TO LEAVE THIS ARCHIPELAGO BUT THIS DESPAIR ITSELF IS GOOD.

MAY 9.
DEPART FOR OLYMPIA. THE ROAD TO THE GULF OF CORINTH. BEACHES AND GULFS. SWIM IN XYLOKASTRO. THIS TIME IT IS THE INTENSITY OF THE TREES THE WATERS THE FRESH FRUITS OF THE EARTH. A LITTLE BEFORE OLYMPIA THE HILLS ARE COVERED WITH FRAGILE CYPRESSES. GENTLENESS AND TENDERNESS OF THESE PLACES BENEATH A LIGHT THAT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME A LITTLE GREY. THE TALL PINES AND THE REMAINS OF THE TEMPLES TO ZEUS AND HERA. THE BIRDS' CRIES THE DAY ENDING THE PEACE THAT SOON RISES FROM THE DORMANT GLEN. AT NIGHT I THINK OF DELOS.

MAY 10.
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MORNING IS GREY ON THE ALPHEUS VALLEY WHICH I SEE FROM MY WINDOW. BUT A SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON THE STONES CYPRESSES AND GREEN PRAIRIES.

C.9 I LOVE THIS ANXIOUS WOUNDED LITTLE FACE TRAGIC AT TIMES BEAUTIFUL ALWAYS; THIS LITTLE BEING WITH ATTACHMENTS SO STRONG BUT WITH A FACE LIT BY A DARK AND GENTLE FLAME THAT OF PURITY OF SOUL.

AND SOMETHING IS BORN IN JEAN THAT RESEMBLES THE LOVE THAT HE HAD FOR J. AS IF HE WERE STILL CAPABLE OF BEGINNING AGAIN (AND AS M.H. IN THE SAME POSITION HAD LOVED JESSICA WITHOUT SAYING SO). BUT HE IS OLD SHE IS YOUNG HE STILL LOVES JESSICA AND THE LOVE THAT HE HAD FOR HER. HE IS SILENT. GIVES UP. LIFE DOES NOT BEGIN AGAIN. HARDLY HAD HE DISCOVERED OR BELIEVED TO DISCOVER THAT HE LOVED HER WHEN TERRIFIED HE DECIDED NEVER TO LAY HIS HANDS ON HER. HE WOULD LIKE IT IF THOSE WHOM WE BEGIN TO LOVE COULD KNOW US AS WE WERE BEFORE MEETING THEM SO THAT THEY COULD PERCEIVE WHAT THEY HAVE MADE OF US.

INSERTED LETTER.
I AM OLD OR I WILL BE. I'VE SPENT HALF OF MY LIFE AS A MAN DEFENDING ONE PERSON AT THE PRICE OF SACRIFICING ANOTHER AND PERHAPS A PART OF MYSELF. WHAT I'VE SPENT TWELVE YEARS PROTECTING I CANNOT THROW AWAY FOR A FEW MONTHS OR A FEW YEARS OF LIFE. THE PERSON FOR WHOM I BROKE ANOTHER PERSON I CANNOT BREAK HER IN TURN LIKE A MISCHIEVOUS CHILD WHO MUTILATES ALL HIS TOYS ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT LOVE THAT ANY FEELING ALWAYS ENDED UP RESEMBLING WHAT IT WAS AT THE VERY SECOND OF ITS CONCEPTION. AND WHAT I'VE FELT BEFORE YOU IS LOVE WITHOUT POSSESSION THE HEART'S GIFT. POSSESSION IS ADDED TO LOVE AND IT HAS A DIMENSION BUT NOT SENSUAL....

IT'S THERE THAT PERHAPS WE COULD REDISCOVER A SORT OF ALLIANCE A MARRIAGE KNOWN ONLY TO US AN ENGAGEMENT AN AGREEMENT.

TIME NO LONGER EXISTED FOR ME; 10 HOURS A DAY IN THE THEATRE BASEMENT BENEATH THE REHEARSAL LAMPS' POOR AND AT THE SAME TIME INTENSE LIGHT; FASCINATED I FOLLOWED OVER THIS SMALL FACE WHICH WAS LIT FROM INSIDE BY ANOTHER LIGHT A DAY OF SUFFERING ALL THE EMOTIONS THAT THE PAIN OF LIVING CAN PRODUCE ON THE HUMAN FACE. I WAS THERE BEFORE WHAT IS MOST PROFOUND WOUNDED SOLEMN AND UNARMED IN MAN. AND WHEN WE WENT OUT THE UNPREDICTABLE RAINS OR THE GENTLE SEPTEMBER NIGHTS WERE WELCOMED AS THEY WERE AN IMMUTABLE ORDER THE BACKDROP FOR THAT WHICH IS AGITATED AND SUFFERED IN THE HEARTS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND WHICH ALONE FOR LONG WEEKS MADE ME ALIVE AND FULL.

THOUGHTS OF DEATH.

AUGUST 6.
VISITING CAYLA: A SILENT AND SOLITARY PLACE AROUND WHICH THE WORLD COMES TO DIE. I UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT I LATER READ IN EUGENIE DE GUERIN'S JOURNAL: "I WOULD GLADLY MAKE A VOW OF CONFINEMENT TO CAYLA. NO OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD PLEASES ME LIKE MY HOME." AND YET: "WHERE WILL I BE? WHERE WILL WE BE WHEN THESE TREES GROW TALL AGAIN? OTHERS WILL STROLL BENEATH THEIR SHADE AND WILL SEE AS WE SEE THE PASSING WINDS THAT WILL KNOCK THEM DOWN."

THE OLD BELIEVERS IN RUSSIA THOUGHT THAT WE CARRY A SMALL DEVIL ON THE LEFT SHOULDER AND AN ANGEL ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER. THERE IS AN IDEA FOR THE THEATRE (FOR DON FAUST?): THE ANGEL AND THE DEVIL GROW ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY ARE NOURISHED. IN GENERAL ONE OR THE OTHER IS HEIGHTENED. MY CHARACTER RETURNS WITH TWO SMALLER CHARACTERS OF EQUAL HEIGHT. THEIR DIALOGUES: BETWEEN THEM THE CHARACTER TO THE TWO CREATURES THE TWO TO THE CHARACTER ETC. ETC.

AUGUST 8 1957. CORDES.
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER READING CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ABSOLUTE DOUBT ABOUT MY VOCATION. I SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING UP. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT CREATION WAS A DIALOGUE. BUT WITH WHOM? OUR LITERARY SOCIETY WHOSE PRINCIPLE IS SECOND-RATE SPITE WHERE OFFENSE TAKES THE PLACE OF CRITICAL METHOD? SOCIETY IN GENERAL? A POPULACE THAT DOES NOT READ US A BOURGEOISIE MASS WHO IN A YEAR READS THE PRESS AND TWO POPULAR BOOKS? IN REALITY THE CREATOR TODAY CAN ONLY BE A SOLITARY PROPHET INHABITED EATEN BY A DISPROPORTIONATE CREATION. AM I THIS CREATOR? I BELIEVED IT. MORE PRECISELY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BE IT. TODAY I DOUBT IT AND THE TEMPTATION IS STRONG TO REJECT THIS INCESSANT EFFORT WHICH RENDERS ME UNHAPPY IN HAPPINESS ITSELF THIS EMPTY ASCETICISM THIS CALL THAT ALERTS ME TOWARD WHAT I DO NOT KNOW. I WOULD DO THEATRE I WOULD RANDOMLY WRITE DRAMATIC WORKS WITHOUT WORRY I WOULD BE FREE PERHAPS. WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO WITH ESTIMABLE OR HONEST ART? AND AM I CAPABLE OF WHAT I DREAM? IF I AM NOT CAPABLE OF IT WHAT GOOD IS IT TO DREAM? TO FREE ME FROM THIS TOO AND TO CONSENT TO NOTHING! OTHERS WHO WERE GREATER THAN I HAVE DONE IT.

WHO PROPOSE TO HER A MEETING WITH THOSE IN CHARGE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS TO ASK HER REGARDING HER BOOKLET (ALGERIA '57) SHE ACCEPTS. THEN MEETING PROCEDURES: SHE WAITS BRIEFLY AT A HOUSE IN THE CASBAH WHERE SHE IS RECEIVED BY TWO WOMEN. THEN TWO ARMED MEN ARRIVE. THEY ARGUE. G.T. EXPLAINS HER THESIS TO THEM THE REDUCTION OF A POPULATION TO BEGGARY THE BULK OF AUXILIARY WAGES WHICH COME FROM FRANCE THE METROPOLIS ETC. (HER OPINION: POLITICALLY VALID ECONOMICALLY UNCULTIVATED). AT THIS MOMENT THE ONE WHO APPEARS TO BE THE LEADER SAYS: "YOU TAKE US FOR MURDERERS." THEN G.T. SAYS: "BUT YOU ARE MURDERERS" (THIS IS SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK ON THE CASINO DE LA CORNICHE). THEN THE OTHER'S PAINFUL REACTION: TEARS IN HIS EYES. THEN: "THESE BOMBS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA." "THAT IS UP TO YOU ALONE" G.T. SAYS. THEY TALK ABOUT TORTURE. I AM THE PLAINTIFF SHE SAYS (SHE BELONGED TO THE COMMISSION ON [THE] NETWORK OF CAMPS). THEY REACH [ONE] COMPROMISE: SUPPRESSION OF CIVILIAN TERRORISM IN EXCHANGE FOR SUPPRESSION OF EXECUTIONS. PRETTY MUCH IN THE TERMS THAT I HAD PROPOSED (BUT THE FOLLOW UP ALAS ... ). THE OTHER MAN REGARDING NAILINGS: "IT'S FRANCE." "GO TELL THAT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER" G.T. SAYS "I WAS THERE. IT'S THE F.L.N. AND YOU KNOW IT." THE LEADER MOTIONS TO THE OTHER MAN IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM SILENT. SHE LEARNS SHORTLY AFTER THAT THIS IS ALI LA POINTE. WHILE LEAVING SHE TAKES HIM BY THE TIE AND SHAKES HIM. "AND DON'T FORGET WHAT I SAID." AND HE RESPONDS: "NO M'DAME."

THE SEAGULLS' WINGS ARE BROKEN EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE /VV IN THE SHAPE OF A ROOFTOP.

THE SOLDIERS ON THE BRIDGE BENEATH THE WIND PRESSED AGAINST THE ROPES THEIR HEADS WRAPPED WITH SCARVES THEIR CAPOTES SHAPELESS. THESE MOMENTS WHERE MAN ABANDONS DEMONSTRATION AND PRESSES AT THE LEVEL OF NEED THIS IS HISTORY.

MOTIONLESS OVER THE UPPER BRIDGE THE GULLS DESCEND AND CONTINUE THEIR PATIENT FLIGHT CLOSE TO ME. THE OBSTINATE GULLS WITH THEIR GLOBULAR EYES THEIR SORCERER'S BEAK THEIR TIRELESS MUSCLES. THE SEAGULLS HAVE NOWHERE TO REST OTHER THAN THE WAVES' CHANGING HOLLOW OR THE TALL MAST'S OSCILLATING CROSS.

FOR ME: I WOULD HAVE SUCCUMBED TO EVERY LAST ONE OF MY REMAINING FEELINGS. I HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED TWO FEELINGS ONE TO THE OTHER.

TIPASA: THE SKY GREY AND SOFT. AT THE CENTER OF THE RUINS THE SLIGHTLY CHOPPY SWELLS COME TO REPLACE THE BIRDS' CHIRPING. THE CHENOUAS6 ENORMOUS AND LIGHT. I WILL DIE AND THIS PLACE WILL CONTINUE TO DOLE OUT PLENITUDE AND BEAUTY. NOTHING BITTER ABOUT THIS IDEA BUT ON THE CONTRARY A FEELING OF GRATITUDE AND VENERATION.

ALGIERS' HEAVY VERTICAL RAIN. ENDLESS. IN A CAGE.

ALGERIANS. THEY LIVE IN THE RICHNESS AND WARMTH OF FRIENDSHIP AND FAMILY. THE BODY AS THE CENTER AND ITS VIRTUES-AND ITS PROFOUND SADNESS AS SOON AS IT DECLINES-LIFE WITHOUT A VIEW OTHER THAN THE IMMEDIATE ONE THAN THE PHYSICAL CIRCLE. PROUD OF THEIR VIRILITY OF THEIR CAPACITY FOR EATING AND DRINKING OF THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR COURAGE. VULNERABLE.

THE STABBED DOVE.

DEAL WITH DEATH WHICH IS TO SAY ACCEPT IT.

ACCEPT MAKING A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF. I WILL NOT DIE OF THIS ANGUISH. IF I DIED FROM IT THE END. OTHERWISE AT WORST SHORTSIGHTED BEHAVIOR. IT SUFFICES TO ACCEPT OTHERS' JUDGMENT. HUMILITY AND ACCEPTANCE: PURELY MEDICAL REMEDIES OF ANGUISH.

THE WORLD MOVES TOWARD PAGANISM BUT IT STILL REJECTS PAGAN VALUES. THEY MUST BE RESTORED TO PAGANIZE BELIEF GRAECIZE CHRIST AND RESTORE BALANCE.

WOULDN'T IT BE THAT I HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE EXCESS OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES?

SINCE I AM IN THE DESERT AND LIFELESSNESS I MUST PUSH ARIDITY ALL THE WAY TO THE END SO THAT THE THRESHOLD IS REACHED AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CROSSED OVER. MADNESS OR COMPLETE CONTROL.

SECOND ASSOCIATION: GENERAL RELAXATION.

IN THE LONG RUN: TRANSFER AND ACCUMULATION OF THE ENERGY THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL WANT OR DESIRE BY THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THIS WANT AND THIS DESIRE.

WITH REGARD TO SOCIETY RECOGNIZE THAT I EXPECT NOTHING FROM IT. ANY PARTICIPATION THEN BECOMES A GIFT THAT DOES NOT AWAIT REPAYMENT. PRAISE OR BLAME THEN BECOME WHAT THEY ARE: NOTHING. FINALLY SUPPRESSION OF THE CONFORMIST.

ELIMINATE THE BROODING MORALS FROM ABSTRACT JUSTICE.

REMAIN CLOSE TO THE REALITY OF BEINGS AND THINGS. RETURN AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE TO PERSONAL HAPPINESS. NOT REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS TRUE EVEN WHEN THE TRUTH HAPPENS TO THWART THE DESIRABLE. EX.: RECOGNIZING THAT POWER IT ALSO IT ESPECIALLY PERSUADES. THE TRUTH IS WORTH ALL THE TORMENTS. IT ALONE ESTABLISHES THE JOY THAT MUST CROWN THIS EFFORT.

RECOVER ENERGY-AS THE CENTRAL FORCE.

RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ENEMIES. LOVE THAT THEY EXIST.

SYSTEMATICALLY SHATTER AUTOMATISMS FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST. TOBACCO FOOD SEX EMOTIONAL REACTIONS OF DEFENSE (OR OF ATTACK. THEY ARE THE SAME THING) AND CREATION ITSELF. ASCETICISM NOT OUT OF THE DESIRE THAT MUST BE KEPT INTACT BUT OUT OF ITS SATISFACTION.

RECOVER THE GREATEST STRENGTH NOT TO DOMINATE BUT TO GIVE.

MAY 3.
ALMOST A TOTAL RECOVERY; I EVEN HOPE FOR INCREASED STRENGTH. UNDERSTAND BETTER NOW WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN: THE ONE WHO DRAGS THROUGH HIS LIFE AND SUCCUMBS UNDER ITS WEIGHT CANNOT HELP ANYONE WITH THE FEW DUTIES HE DOES TAKE ON. THE ONE WHO CONTROLS HIMSELF AND CONTROLS HIS LIFE CAN BE TRULY GENEROUS AND GIVE WITHOUT EFFORT EXPECTING NOTHING AND ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT THIS STRENGTH TO GIVE AND TO WORK.

END OF APRIL 1958. CANNES.?
AT SEA EVERY DAY. IN THE EVENING THE NETS' BUOYS (A BOTTLE WITH A LEAD CLAPPER THE WHOLE THING FLOATING ON CORK) MAKE THE SOUND OF BELLS GATHERING THE SEA'S FLOCKS. AT NIGHT IN THE PORT THE BOAT'S MASTS AND BRIDGES SHRIEK AND WHIMPER.

THE LIGHT-THE LIGHT-AND THE ANXIETY RETREAT NOT YET GONE BUT DULLED AS IF PUT TO SLEEP BY THE HEAT AND SUN.

APRIL :30.
MARTIN DU GARD. NICE. HE STRAGGLES ALONG WITH HIS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. 77 YEARS OLD. "IN THE FACE OF DEATH NOTHING PREVAILS NOT EVEN MY WORK. THERE IS NOTHING NOTHING...." "YES IT IS GOOD NOT TO FEEL ALONE" (AND HIS EYES FILL WITH TEARS). WE SET A RENDEZVOUS FOR JULY AT TERTRE.8 "IF I AM ALIVE." BUT ALWAYS THIS SAME HEART INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING.

MAY 29 1958.
MY JOB IS TO MAKE MY BOOKS AND TO FIGHT WHEN THE FREEDOM OF MY OWN AND MY PEOPLE IS THREATENED. THAT'S ALL.

THE ARTIST IS LIKE THE GOD OF DELPHI: "HE DOES NOT SHOW NOR DOES HE HIDE: HE SIGNIFIES."

CHEKHOV: "I AM NEITHER A LIBERAL NOR A CONSERVATIVE.... MY HOLY OF HOLIES IS THE HUMAN BODY HEALTH INTELLIGENCE TALENT INSPIRATION LOVE AND ABSOLUTE FREEDOM. THE FREEDOM FROM ALL BRUTE FORCE AND ALL LIES IN WHATEVER MANNER THEY ARE EXPRESSED:

THAT IS WHAT MY AGENDA WOULD BE IF I WERE A GREAT ARTIST" (LETTER TO PLESHCHEYEV.`' 1888).

MUSIL': A GREAT PROJECT THAT SUPPOSES ALL THE MEANS OF ART WHICH HE DOES NOT HAVE. HENCE THIS WORK IS MOVING BY ITS FAILURES NOT BY WHAT IT SAYS. THIS AUTHOR'S INTERMINABLE MONOLOGUE WHERE THE GENIUS SHINES IN SOME PASSAGES AND WHERE ART NEVER SHINES IN ITS ENTIRETY.

MUSIL. "EACH ONE OF US POSSESSES A SECOND NATURE WHERE EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES IS INNOCENT."

"ORDINARY LIFE IS THE AVERAGE OF ALL OUR POSSIBLE CRIMES."

MAMAN. IF WE LOVED ENOUGH THOSE WHOM WE LOVE WE WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DYING.

JUNE 9 1958.
NEW DEPARTURE FOR GREECE.2

JUNE 10.
ACROPOLIS. THE FEELING IS NOT AS GREAT AS THE FIRST TIME. I WAS NOT ALONE AND SO I PREOCCUPIED MYSELF WITH MY COM PANY. AND THEN THE MEETING WITH 0. WHICH BOTHERS ME. THE ACROPOLIS IS NOT A PLACE WHERE ONE COULD LIE. AT TWO O'CLOCK THE AIRPLANE TO RHODES. ISLANDS ROCKS ON THE SEA DRIFTING OFF BEHIND US. PULVERIZATION OF CONTINENTS. IN RHODES WE LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF FIELDS WHERE SHORT FLOWERY WHEAT GROWS WHICH THE WIND MOVES IN WAVES TOWARD THE BLUE SEA. SUMPTUOUS FLORID ISLAND. THE PROMENADE AT NIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FRANKISH ARCHITECTURE. ENCOUNTER WITH R. P. BRUCKBERGER WHO ANNOUNCES TO ME HIS INTENTION TO BREAK WITH THE CHURCH WITHOUT DEFROCKING. MY LIKING FOR HIM ALWAYS ALIVE. BOAT WITH MICHEL G. AND PRASSINOS.

JUNE 11.
I GET OFF THE BOAT IN THE EARLY MORNING ALONE AND GO TO WASH ON THE BEACH OF RHODES TWENTY MINUTES AWAY ALONE. THE WATER IS CLEAR FRESH. THE SUN AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS TRIP WARMS WITHOUT BURNING. DELECTABLE MOMENTS THAT REMIND ME OF MADRAGUE MORNINGS TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I USED TO LEAVE THE TENT SLEEPILY A FEW METERS FROM THE SEA TO PLUNGE INTO THE SOMNOLENT MORNING WATER.' ALAS I CAN NO LONGER SWIM. OR RATHER I CAN NO LONGER BREATHE AS I USED TO. NEVERTHELESS I REGRET LEAVING THE BEACH WHERE I HAVE JUST BEEN HAPPY.

AT TEN O'CLOCK WE LEAVE RHODES TO PASS THE NORTHERN POINT OF THE ISLAND AND TO ARRIVE NEAR LINDOS.

12:30 LINDOS.
SMALL NATURAL PORT ALMOST ENCLOSED. PERFECT BAY. WE LOSE AN ANCHOR IN THE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WATERS. INITIALLY THE BAY IS DOMINATED BY THE VILLAGE'S WHITE HOUSES THEN BY THE ACROPOLIS FORTIFIED BY MEDIEVAL RAMPARTS IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH RISE DORIC COLUMNS.

WE REACH THE BEACH IN A DINGHY. SWIM. AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON WE CLIMB TOWARD THE ACROPOLIS. OVER THE TOP WIDE STEEP STAIRS LEAD TO AN IMMENSE MIDAIR SPACE WHICH ON ONE SIDE DOMINATES THE PORT WHERE WE ARE ANCHORED AND ON THE OTHER A BALANCED DIZZYING VOID ANOTHER ENCLOSED COVE THE ONE WHERE SAINT PAUL LANDED. ABOVE THIS SPACE THE SWALLOWS TURN DRUNK WITH LIGHT PLUNGE VERTICALLY INTO THE VOID AND CLIMB BACK UP WITH PIERCING CRIES. THE DAY ENDS OVER THE COLUMNS THE TWO BAYS THE CAPES THAT MULTIPLY ALL THE WAY TO THE HORIZON AND THE IMMENSE SEA BEFORE US. FEELING OF POWERLESSNESS TO JOIN TO EXPRESS SO MUCH BEAUTY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNITION BEFORE THE WORLD'S PERFECT STATE. BACK IN THE CITY THE YOUNG DONKEYS THE ROWBOAT IN THE EVENING ... DURING THE NIGHT THE DONKEYS' LOUD BRAYING.

JUNE 12.
AT SIX O'CLOCK I CLIMB ONTO THE DECK ONE LAST TIME TO SEE THE BAY THAT I LOVE. EVERYONE ON BOARD IS ASLEEP EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN. IN THE MILD MORNING THE SCENT OF LINDOS SCENT OF FROTH OF HEAT OF DONKEYS AND GRASS OF SMOKE ...

RHODES AT 8:30 A.M.
STROLL TO SEE A GORGE FULL OF FRESHLY HATCHED BUTTERFLIES. THEY ARE NESTLED IN THE GRASS THE TREES THE CAVES AND BEFORE OUR STEPS THEY DISPERSE IN SILENT AND BUSTLING CLOUDS. CRUSHING HEAT. RETURN. DEPART FOR MARMARIS A TURKISH PORT AT THREE P.M. ARRIVE AT FIVE P.M. THE BAY WE ARE ANCHORED IN THE MIDDLE OF IS BEAUTIFUL BUT SOMBER. THE LITTLE TOWN FROM AFAR LOOKS PATHETIC. AND LITTLE BY LITTLE WE SEE ALL THE INHAB ITANTS GATHERING ON THE PIER. THE TURKISH POLICE AND CUSTOMS OFFICERS ARRIVE ON BOARD. INTERMINABLE DISCUSSIONS TO SETTLE THE CUSTOMARY FORMALITIES. THEN WE DISEMBARK AND ARE SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF DISHEVELED CHILDREN. THE POVERTY THE DERELICTION OF THE STREETS AND HOUSES MAKES THE HEART ACHE SO MUCH SO THAT WE RETURN WITHOUT WAITING ANY LONGER. AFTER DINNER ANOTHER VISIT FROM THE OFFICIALS. MORE DISCUSSIONS (THEY DO NOT SPEAK ANY WESTERN LANGUAGE) INTERMINABLE. THEY KEPT THE PASSPORTS ETC. WE WILL GET THEM AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. THE CAPTAIN PROTESTS . . . ETC. WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO PICK THEM UP THE NEXT MORNING.

JUNE 1:1.
DEPART AT SEVEN O' CLOCK. AT ELEVEN O' CLOCK THE ISLAND OF SYNRI. ADMIRABLE GREEK CLEANLINESS. THE POOREST HOUSES ARE FRESHLY PAINTED WITH LIME DECORATED ETC. UNBELIEVABLE AND REVOLTING THAT THE TURKS COULD HAVE DOMINATED THESE PEOPLE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. SWIM. BUT GROWING CLAUSTROPHOBIA. FOR EVERYTHING ELSE SUPERB FORM. AT THREE T'.W WE AGAIN SET OUT FOR KOS.

KOS. SMALL PORT WHERE LIFE IS EASY AT NIGHT. MUSIC. THE RADIO'S LOUDSPEAKERS SHOUT THE EVENTS OF CYPRUS WITH A TONE I KNOW ALL TOO WELL. WE DINE BENEATH A PINK LIGHT.

JUNE 14.
THE ISLAND. SMALL TEMPLE ON A BEACH WITH CLEAR WATER. SWINE AND LUNCH IN PSAMEROS. IN THE SMALL COVE FIVE HOUSES PAINTED WITH LIME WHITE AND BLUE. THE LITTLE GIRLS GET IN THE WATER IN THEIR SHIRTS AND SWIM TOWARD US.

EVERY DAY THE MONSTROUS SUN ... NOT HEAVY NOR VEILED BY MIST BUT CLEAR AND PURE HURLING ALL ITS HEAT FEROCIOUS ...

TO KALYMNOS AT SIX P.M. THE SEA IS COVERED WITH SHORT COOL WAVES.... DOZENS OF CHILDREN WITH ROUND HEADS ESCORT US. KATINA. JUNE 15 THE FOLLOWING DAY SHE RUNS ALL THE WAY TO THE PASS AND AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME WAVES HER HAND. NOON SWIM IN LEROS. THEN TOWARD PATMOS WHERE WE ENTER A BAY THAT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY PROTECTED. THE EVENING HOUR.

JUNE 16.
CLIMB UPON MULES AND DONKEYS TOWARD PATMOS AND THE MONASTERY OF ST. JEAN DE P. FROM UP THERE THE TWO ISTHMUSES. THE VIOLENT NORTHERN WIND (THE MELTEM) PICKED UP. THE GREEK MISTRAL HAS THE SAME EFFECTS: IT BRUSHES THE SKY AND BRINGS FORTH A PURIFIED LIGHT CLEAR TAUT ALMOST METALLIC. BUT IT PREVENTS US FROM RETURNING TO THE SEA; WE HAVE TO WAIT HERE UNTIL IT CALMS.

JUNE 17.
DEPART AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING UNDER THE MELTEM TO HEAD TOWARD GAIDAROS. BUT THE SEA IS FURIOUS. SHAKEN FOR THREE HOURS BY BIG WAVES-EVERYBODY ON BOARD SICK OR SALLOW-THE BOAT IS DIVERTED TO THE FOURNI ISLANDS. SHELTER IN A DESERTED COVE WHERE THE WIND BLOWS LESS BUT IT BLOWS. DAY OF WAITING. TOWARD THE EVENING THE WIND DIES DOWN A LITTLE BUT IT IS TOO LATE TO LEAVE.

JUNE 18.
THE WIND WHICH PICKED UP AGAIN DURING THE NIGHT NOW BLOWS VIOLENTLY. WE WAIVE DEPARTURE. THEN SINCE NOTHING CHANGES AND THE BREAD IS RUNNING OUT-THE WATER SOON-WE DECIDE TO LEAVE AROUND SIX P.M. REGARDLESS. EVERYONE IN THE COCKPIT. HEAVY SQUALLS BUT WE ARRIVE IN EYESHOT OF THE FIRES OF TIGANI (ANCIENT SAMOS) AROUND EIGHT-THIRTY P.M.

GENTLENESS OF THE SMALL PORT QUIET IN THE NIGHT AFTER THE VIOLENT SEA.

JUNE 19.
IN THE MORNING I GO FOR A SWIM ALONE. DEPART BY CAR TO VISIT THE ISLAND. ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE OF OLIVE TREES AND FILIFORM CYPRESSES THAT FURNISH THE SLOPES OF THE HILLS AND MOUNTAINS TOWARD THE SEA. AFTER HAVING TAKEN A DIP WE LUNCH IN A SMALL VILLAGE ON THE SOUTHERN COAST. THE TABLE IS OUTSIDE. A CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN PLAY AROUND US THEN COME TO LOOK AT US. ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS MATINA WITH GOLDEN EYES TOUCHES MY HEART. WHEN WE LEAVE SHE COMES CLOSE TO THE CAR AND I TAKE HER SMALL HAND. TOWARD THE EVENING THE HERAION THE CRUSHED TEMPLE WHOSE FORMIDABLE DEBRIS-SCATTERED IN FRONT OF THE SEA AMONG THE REEDS AND OATS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ADMIRABLE LANDSCAPE OF MOUNTAINS AND SEA-HAS ITSELF BEEN DESTROYED BY THE RECENT EARTHQUAKES. IN A NEARBY CAFE WHERE OUR DRIVERS OFFER US A DRINK THEY BEGIN TO DANCE TOGETHER TO THE SOUND OF A RADIO FOR THEIR PLEASURE AND OURS.

POLYCRATES TYRANT OF SAMOS "BRILLIANT STATESMEN AND DEPRAVED TYRANT." FRIGHTENED BY HIS OWN LUCK-INSOLENT PERPETUAL-AND BY HIS UNFLINCHING SUCCESSES AND HIS FABULOUS WEALTH HE THREW AN EXPENSIVE RING THAT HE WORE ON HIS FINGER INTO THE SEA IN ORDER TO BESEECH FATE. BUT A FISH SERVED ON HIS TABLE RETURNED TO HIM THIS RING THAT IT HAD SWALLOWED. COMPLETED THE HERAION HELD A SUMPTUOUS COURT WHERE THE ARTS HELD GREAT IMPORTANCE. PERISHED CRUCIFIED BY THE STRATEGIC CROITES WHO LURED HIM INTO A TRAP (522).

JUNE 20.
DAY AT SEA TOWARD CHIOS. IN THE MORNING A MANATEE BENEATH THE BOW. IT ROLLS MOVES FORWARD WADDLES WITH A MOCKING AIR THEN PLUNGES TOWARD THE DEPTHS. A LITTLE LATER A FEW MILES FROM SHORE THE SCENT OF ROSEBAYS COMES TO US ON THE WIND. AFTERNOON OF SUN AND SWIMMING IN A COVE WHERE THE WATER IS ETHEREAL DUE TO ITS CLARITY; WE ENTER CHIOS ON A BEAUTIFUL AND QUIET EVENING.

JUNE 21.
CHIOS. TURKISH QUARTER. CROSSING THE ISLAND. THE ENORMOUS CINDER-BLOCK HOUSES. RED SOIL. ENORMOUS OLIVE TREES. THE PEASANTS BEATING WHEAT WITH THEIR MULES' HOOVES BENEATH A BLINDING HEAT. THE SUMMER OF MASSACRES.4 FINALLY THE LEPROSARIUM IN A NARROW RAVINE PLANTED WITH EUCALYPTUS DEADENDING IN AN IMPASSE OF ROCKS. SERIES OF LONG DILAPIDATED BROWN AND DARK GREEN BUILDINGS. RETIRED IN THE UNFOLDING EVENING TO THEIR ROOMS WITH LARGE IRON BEDS COVERED WITH COARSE BROWN BLANKETS. 11 LEPROUS WOMEN AND 3 LEPROUS MEN ROAM BENEATH THE VERANDAS. SOME HAVE LOST FINGERS. OTHERS WITH LARGE TURBID EYES YELLOW WITHOUT PUPILS OR EYEBALLS LIKE AN ENORMOUS ROTTEN DROP OF WATER. THEIR NATURAL GAIETY BENEATH THEIR THICK GREYISH CLOTHES OF INFINITE POVERTY. ONE OF THEM COMPLAINS THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO REMOVE THEM FROM THIS MISERABLE PLACE TO MOVE THEM ELSEWHERE.... EVENING DANCES AND LAUGHTER VERY LATE INTO THE NIGHT.

JUNE 22.
TOWARD MYTILENE. VAST INDENTATION OF BAYS AND BEACHES. THE OLIVE TREES GO DOWN ALMOST TO THE SEA. P. IS SICK. DOCTOR (PARITIS). ASCENT TO AYASSOS. DIP. I SWIM A LITTLE. DEPART ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ISLAND. AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON HUNDREDS OF TERNS FLYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL WATER AGAIN RISE BY THE BOAT. ARRIVAL AT SIGRIS.

(WE ARRIVE IN THE PORTS AT SUNSET. AND AT TIMES THE SUN MASKED THE PORT FROM US THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HILL AND IN THE TWILIGHT THE PORT APPEARED.... )

SIGNS. RETURN TO SIGRIS. TWO ENCLOSED BAYS. NAKED HILLS. SMOOTH WATER EVENING LIGHT. THE WORLD AND LIFE END HERE. AND BEGIN AGAIN.

THE VILLAGE VIEWED FROM THE BOAT AT NIGHT IS ILLUMINATED BY SAINT-JEAN'S FIRES.5

DEPART DURING THE NIGHT. MICHEL AND I TAKE THE MIDNIGHT WATCH. NIGHT ON THE SEA IMMENSE AFTER THE CRESCENT MOON SETS IN THE WEST. THE CONSTELLATIONS DESCEND TOWARD THE HORIZON. UNFORESEEN ISLANDS TAKE SHAPE IN THE SHADOWS ON THE HORIZON. IN THE MORNING SKYROS LAYERED OVER ITS CRESTS.

DEPART AT THREE P.M. FOR SKOPELOS. IN THE AFTERNOON THE NORTHERN SPORADES. ONE TWO FIVE TEN FOURTEEN ISLANDS APPEAR ON THE SEA. SKOPELOS AT NIGHT AND ITS ROOFS' EDGES ARE UNDERLINED WITH LIME. JASMINE POMEGRANATES HIBISCUS. PEACEFUL NIGHT. IN THE MORNING SKIATHOS AND WE TAKE THE EURIPUS STRAIT.

JUNE 26.
KHALKIS. PREFACE GRENIER6: "EACH CONSCIENCE WANTS THE DEATH OF THE OTHER." BUT NO. MASTER AND SLAVE. MASTER AND DISCIPLE. HISTORY WAS BUILT ON ADMIRATION AS MUCH AS ON HATRED.

FOR THIS BOOK I WANT THE YOUNG READER WHO RESEMBLES THE ONE THAT I USED TO BE.

LIKE THAT QUEST FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND THAT MELVILLE ILLUSTRATED IN MARDI THIS ONE ENDS IN A MEDITATION ON THE ABSOLUTE AND THE DIVINE.

KHALKIS. AT NIGHT VAST AND SILENT BAY OF MARATHON. THE WATERS SUDDENLY SETTLE. ONLY A BRIEF AND HEAVY SURF. AND NIGHT FALLS OVER THE IMMENSE CORRIE OF MOUNTAINS AND OVER THE SUDDENLY MYSTERIOUS BAY. BEAUTY SLEEPS ON THE WATERS.

JUNE 27.
IN THE EARLY MORNING WHILE THE CICADAS BEGIN TO SHRIEK IN THE SURROUNDING HILLS SWIM IN THE STILL AND FRESH WATER. THEN THE SEA AND AT TWELVE O'CLOCK KEA THE ISLAND WITH GREEN ROCKS LARGE PASTY OYSTERS BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY VEILED SKY. BUT DURING THE NIGHT THE SOUTHERN WIND PICKS UP AND THE NEXT DAY THE 28TH WE ARE STUCK IN KEA. 29TH. DEPART IN THE MORNING ON BAD WATERS. SOUNION. LIGHT. HYDRA SPETSAI FOR THE NIGHT. 30TH. POROS EGINE AND AGAIN AYIA MARINA LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO. MARVELOUS ISLAND AT THE CENTER OF A WHIRLING OF LIGHT AND SPACE. RETURN THERE.

JULY 1ST.
ATHENS. HEAT. DUST. IDIOTIC HOTEL. FATIGUED. 2ND. DELPHI. AGAIN THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE IN LIGHT LEVELS. I LAY MY FEET IN MY FOOTSTEPS. EVENING SCENT OVER THE SMALL STAGE. 3RD. RETURN TO CORINTH. UNTIL PATRAS. ALONE QUICK DIP THE WATER ... PATRAS: LARGE DUSTY ORAN UGLY AND ALIVE. 4TH. OLYMPIA. 5TH. MYCENAE ARGOS. THE TALL PINES OF OLYMPIA CRACKLE WITH CICADAS. GREECE BURSTING WITH SONOROUS BRAYING IN THE VALLEY HOLLOWS ON THE SLOPES OF THE ISLAND.

PAVESE.7 AS IF THE SOLE REASON WHY WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT OURSELVES IS THAT WE HAVE TO STAY WITH OURSELVES LONGER THAN WITH ANYONE ELSE. AS IF GENIUS IS FECUNDITY. TO HE IS TO EXPRESS TO EXPRESS CONSTANTLY. AS IF IDLENESS MAKES THE HOURS SLOW AND THE YEARS FAST AND ACTIVITY MAKES THE HOURS BRIEF AND THE YEARS SLOW. AS IF ALL LIBERTINES ARE SENTIMENTALISTS BECAUSE FOR THEM THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE AN OBJECT OF EMOTION NOT OF DUTY.

ID. "WHEN A WOMAN MARRIES SHE BELONGS TO ANOTHER AND WHEN SHE BELONGS TO ANOTHER THERE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING TO SAY TO HIM."

ID. THE OLD MENTINA WOMAN WHO FOR SEVENTY YEARS HAS IGNORED HISTORY. SHE HAS LIVED A "STATIC AND IMMOBILE LIFE." THAT GIVES PAVESE THE SHIVERS. AND WHAT IF THE OLD MENTINA WOMAN HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER?

LIVE IN AND FOR THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH OF WHAT WE ARE FOREMOST. QUIT COMPROMISING WITH PEOPLE. THE TRUTH OF WHAT IS. DON'T BE TRICKY WITH REALITY. ACCEPT THEN ITS ORIGINALITY AND ITS IMPOTENCY. LIVE ACCORDING TO THIS ORIGINALITY UNTIL THIS IMPOTENCY. AT THE CENTER CREATION WITH THE IMMENSE FORCE OF THE PERSON FINALLY BEING RESPECTED.

RETURN. LUNCH WITH A.M. HE TELLS ME THAT MASSU AND TWO OR THREE OF HIS COLLABORATORS HAVE SUBMITTED TO TORTURE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO ... (THE DIFFERENCE: THEY CHOSE IT. THERE IS NO HUMILIATION.) STRANGE IMPRESSION.

SINCE RETURNING FROM GREECE TEN DAYS AGO BODILY STRENGTH AND JOY. SLEEP OF THE SOUL AND HEART. IN THE DEPTHS THE CONVENT SLEEPS THE STRONG AND BARE HOUSE WHERE SILENCE CONTEMPLATES.

THE LIE LULLS OR DREAMS LIKE ILLUSION. THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY POWER CHEERFUL INEXHAUSTIBLE. IF WE WERE ABLE TO LIVE ONLY OF AND FOR TRUTH: YOUNG AND IMMORTAL ENERGY IN US. THE MAN OF TRUTH DOES NOT AGE. A LITTLE MORE EFFORT AND HE WILL NOT DIE.

LETTER TO AMROUCHE
NOVEMBER 19

MY DEAR AMROUCHE I

IT'S TIME-AND HEALTH-THAT HAS KEPT ME FROM RESPONDING TO YOU. IT WAS NECESSARY TO RESPOND AT LENGTH AND I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH MY ORDINARY MAIL. TODAY I AM NO BETTER ABLE TO DO SO. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DELAY IN THANKING YOU FOR YOUR SECOND LETTER WHICH TOUCHED ME. I OWE YOU HOWEVER THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT I THINK. PERSONAL QUESTIONS CANNOT SEPARATE US. WHAT ARE THEY IN THE FACE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND ABOUT TO HAPPEN? BUT I WAS PAINFULLY SHOCKED BY WHAT YOU WROTE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ABOUT FRENCH-ALGERIANS IN GENERAL (IN LE MONDE AND IN COMMUNE). YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE POSITIONS OF THE F.L.N. FOR MY PART I THINK OF THEM AS MURDEROUS IN THE PRESENT BLIND AND DANGEROUS IN THE FUTURE. BUT EVEN WHILE PLACING YOURSELF ON THIS SIDE YOU MUST MAKE THE NECESSARY DISTINCTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE NOT DONE. I HAVE GIVEN UP ON TRYING TO MAKE A VOICE OF REASON HEARD PUBLICLY. I HOPE AGAINST ALL HOPE TO ONE DAY BE ABLE TO DO SO. BUT IN PRIVATE I MUST TELL YOU MY REACTION AND YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE THE SHOOTING NOR JUSTIFY THAT THEY SHOOT AT THE FRENCH-ALGERIANS IN GENERAL AND THUS ENTANGLED SHOOT AT MY FAMILY WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN POOR AND WITHOUT HATRED AND WHO SHOULD NOT BE MIXED UP IN AN UNJUST REBELLION. NO CAUSE EVEN IF IT HAD REMAINED INNOCENT AND JUST WILL EVER TEAR ME FROM MY MOTHER WHO IS THE GREATEST CAUSE THAT I KNOW IN THE WORLD.'

IN THIS SINCERE LANGUAGE I KNOW YOU WILL AGAIN FIND AN ECHO OF PAST FRATERNITIES. CAN THEY INSPIRE YOU TO WORK TOWARD APPEASEMENT AND ASSEMBLY RATHER THAN TOWARD FRATRICIDAL SEPARATION; THAT IS THE WISH THAT FORMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART YOUR BROTHER OF BIRTH AND SKY.

MONSIEUR

MY POOR HEALTH HAS DELAYED THIS REPLY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AFTER HAVING RECOGNIZED WHAT IRREMEDIABLY SEPARATES ME FROM THE LEFT AS WELL AS FROM THE RIGHT WITH REGARD TO THE ALGERIAN QUESTION I DECIDED NO LONGER TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ANY PUBLIC CAMPAIGN ON THIS SUBJECT. COLLECTIVE SIGNATURES-THESE AMBIGUOUS ALLIANCES BETWEEN MEN WHICH ALL BY THE WAY BREAK APART-LEAD TO CONFUSIONS THAT LARGELY OVERFLOW AND CONSEQUENTLY COMPROMISE THE OBJECTIVE THEY MEAN TO SERVE. EVEN WHEN THIS OBJECTIVE IS VALID AS IS THE CASE I HAVE CONSEQUENTLY DECIDED NO LONGER TO ACT EXCEPT PERSONALLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS AND AT THE MOMENT THAT I DEEM USEFUL NO MATTER WHAT PRESSURES ARE EXERTED UPON ME.

MOREOVER I INTEND TO HANDLE THE QUESTIONS THAT INTEREST YOU IN A BOOK THAT WILL COME OUT SOON AND THAT WILL SPEAK FOR ME ALONE. IN ANY CASE I ENTRUST THIS PERSONAL RESPONSE TO YOUR LOYALTY AND ASK YOU TO ACCEPT MY SINCERE REGARDS.

LETTER TO GUERIN3
JUNE 9 1954

MY DEAR GUERIN

YOUR ARTICLE FROM THE PARISIAN (I DO NOT READ THIS JOURNAL AND I AM NOT SUBSCRIBED TO ARGUS) WAS PASSED ON TO ME. NO IT IS NOT "INGRATITUDE" NOR "RIGOR" THAT I REPROACH YOU FOR. I DO NOT LIKE THE PLACE NOR THE DISCOURTEOUS MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE EXPRESSED. I DO NOT LIKE EITHER THAT YOU SPEAK OF THINGS THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW BY WHICH I MEAN TO SAY OF MY LIFE. IF YOU KNEW MY LIFE YOU WOULD HAVE KEPT SILENT ABOUT THIS POINT. BUT AS FOR CONTENT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE WHAT I PUBLISH AND TO SAY IT OPENLY.

WHAT I REPROACH YOU FOR IS AN UNSPEAKABLE BREACH OF THE CUSTOM WHEREBY A PERSONAL LETTER CANNOT BE PUBLISHED WITHOUT THE SENDER'S AUTHORIZATION. I DID NOT WRITE TO YOU AT THE TIME WHEN I DID SO THAT MY TRUSTING LETTERS WRITTEN WITH FREEDOM OF HEART WOULD TEN YEARS LATER BE LAID OUT IN PUBLIC. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIVULGE YOUR OWN SECRETS TO THAT PUBLIC AND TO SPEAK WITH COMPLETE FREEDOM ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORCE THOSE FRIENDS TO DIVULGE THEIR OWN SECRETS. BY READING THOSE SENTENCES OF AFFECTIONATE CAMARADERIE WRITTEN TO A FRIEND IN PAIN IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE PRINTED THEM AN INTOLERABLE EMBARRASSMENT HAS COME TO ME AND A SORT OF DISGUST THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN ADVANCE AND WHICH I DO NOT FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING INFLICTED UPON ME.

I CANNOT IN ANY CASE LET YOU GO UNAWARE OF MY FEELING ON THIS POINT.

YOURS

ALBERT CAMUS

LETTER TO ANONYMOUS
JULY 20 1956

MADAME

I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME. AND EVEN MORE SO SINCE IT UNDOUBTEDLY CONCERNS I ASSURE YOU A MISUNDERSTANDING.

I MIGHT HAVE MET THE DOCTOR WHOSE NAME YOU MENTIONED BUT THIS NAME MEANS NOTHING TO ME. THUS HE IS NOT ONE OF MY FRIENDS. AND IN ANY CASE I DO NOT KNOW THIS DOCTOR WELL ENOUGH THAT HE COULD EVER TAKE THE LIBERTY TO REVEAL A SECRET CONCERNING A THIRD PARTY. BESIDES SUPPOSING THAT THIS SECRET WERE DIVULGED TO ME TO IMAGINE THAT I COULD HAVE USED IT WITHOUT CARE IS NOT TO KNOW ME VERY WELL.

I ASSURE YOU ON MY HONOR THAT THE DETAILS DESCRIBED IN THE FALL PERTAIN ONLY TO ME. YOUR FRIEND IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES THE HIGH PLATEAUS. I LOVE THEM AND I HAVE LIVED THERE. ONCE TUBERCULAR I IN FACT SUFFER FROM A PULMONARY SCLEROSIS THAT HAS MADE ME CLAUSTROPHOBIC. THOSE WHO SURROUND ME CAN CONFIRM MY FEAR OF PITS CAVES AND ALL ENCLOSED PLACES WHICH COMES FROM THIS QUITE PERSONAL INFIRMITY. PEOPLE OFTEN JOKE WITH ME ABOUT MY IMPATIENCE WITH SPELEOLOGISTS ABOUT MY SADNESS IN THE DEEP ALPINE VALLEYS ETC. AS SUCH EVERY DETAIL THAT STRUCK YOUR FRIEND CAN RECEIVE AN IRREFUTABLE EXPLANATION. AS FOR THE PRINCIPLE ANECDOTE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I DO NOT COME TO DIVULGE SECRETS HERE. LET ME HOWEVER QUOTE FOR YOU A SENTENCE FROM A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM ONE OF MY FRIENDS THE OTHER DAY: "EACH ONE OF US WITHOUT EXCEPTION THUS HAS A GIRL IN HIS LIFE WHOM HE DID NOT RESCUE."

THIS IS CLEAR EVIDENCE AND YOUR FRIEND MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF OF THIS EVIDENCE. YOU SAY THAT HE HAS ALWAYS READ ME WITH REGARD AND PARTICULAR INTEREST. THEN HE IS AWARE THAT I AM UNABLE TO LIE ABOUT SUCH A MATTER.

IT IS ON MY HONOR I REPEAT THAT I ASSURE HIM THAT HE HAS NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH MY CHARACTER. HE HAS NOT BEEN BETRAYED BY ANYONE AND IF HE IS WHAT I IMAGINE HE IS HE WILL GIVE BACK TO HIS FRIENDS THIS CONFIDENCE OF HEART WITHOUT WHICH EVERY LIFE IS AN EXHAUSTING UNHAPPINESS.

A PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DOUBT FROM WHICH YOUR FRIEND SUFFERS TODAY IS THE EXHAUSTING LIFE THAT WE ALL LEAD AND PARTICULARLY SO FOR THOSE WHO ADD THE STRESS OF A PERSONAL WORK TO THE INTERMINABLE WEIGHT OF MODERN LIFE. HOW COULD I NOT UNDERSTAND? SOMETIMES MY DAYS END WITH CLENCHED TEETH AND I OFTEN HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF WALKING AND WORKING BY PURE WILL THAT ALONE HOLDS ME UP. BUT IN THESE CASES WE MUST AGREE TO BE EASY ON OURSELVES AND OUR OWN NATURE. WE MUST RETURN TO A MORE ANIMALISTIC LIFE AT REST IN SOLITUDE.

I HOPE THAT YOUR FRIEND ENLIGHTENED BY MY TESTIMONY WILL AGAIN FIND REST AND PEACE. I WILL THEN COMFORT MYSELF IN HAVING WITHOUT HAVING WANTED TO RID A VIRTUOUS HEART OF ITS TURMOIL. FOR THE TIME BEING I FEEL ONLY SAD TO HAVE DONE HARM WITH ONE OF MY BOOKS AS I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ART WAS NOTHING IF FINALLY IT DID NOT DO GOOD IF IT DID NOT HELP.

LETTER TO M. R.P.
M. R.P.

I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER VERY LATE AND THE NEWS OF MY FRIEND'S BRUTAL DEATH' THAT YOU'VE DELIVERED TO ME HITS HARD EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALL OVER WITH. NEVERTHELESS I WANT TO THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART FOR HAVING THOUGHT OF ME. DIDIER WAS A PART OF MY CHILDHOOD AND MY YOUTH AND WHEN I ENCOUNTERED HIM AGAIN LATER AS A MAN OF RELIGION I HAD NO TROUBLE LIKING ONCE AGAIN WHAT HE HAD NEVER CEASED TO BE. BECAUSE HE HAD REMAINED THE SAME CHILD BECOME THE SAME MAN WITH THE SAME FAITH PURER AND DEEPER AND WITH THE SAME FIDELITY. THE DISCRETION AND CONSTANT SENSITIVITY THAT HE BROUGHT TO OUR RELATIONSHIP FAR TOO DISTANCED BY OUR DIFFERENT LIVES COULD ONLY ENRICH AND RENDER OUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDSHIP THAT MUCH MORE TENDER. THIS END SO SUDDEN SO UNEXPECTED IS A GREAT SORROW FOR ME. FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS THE WORLD HAS BEEN POORER IN MY EYES. I AM AWARE THAT FOR HIM DEATH WAS ONLY A PASSAGE; HE SPOKE KNOWINGLY OF A CERTAIN HOPE. BUT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ME HAVE LOVED HIM WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SHARE THIS HOPE THE GRIEF IS ALLENCOMPASSING. YOU ARE RIGHT: HE REMAINS A MEMORY AND AN EXAMPLE. KNOW THAT WITH GRATITUDE I TRANSFER A PART OF OUR LONG FRIENDSHIP ONTO THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED HIM AND HAD THE JOY OF LIVING NEAR HIM AND DO NOT DOUBT MY FAITHFUL FEELINGS FROM NOW ON.

A.C.

IN THE HOSPITAL X. DISCOVERED SOMETHING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN (BECAUSE OF A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE [...]5 YOUTHBECAUSE OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL) THE SOLIDARITY OF BODIES UNITY AT THE CENTER OF THE MORTAL AND SUFFERING FLESH. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE AND NOTHING ELSE. WE ARE THIS PLUS HUMAN GENIUS IN ALL ITS FORMS FROM THE CHILD TO EINSTEIN.

NO DEAR DOMINIQUE IT IS NOT HUMILIATING TO BE UNHAPPY. PHYSICAL SUFFERING IS SOMETIMES HUMILIATING BUT THE SUFFERING OF BEING CANNOT BE IT IS LIFE JUST LIKE THIS HAPPINESS THAT BERNARD SPEAKS OF IN HIS TEXT WITH A CONVICTION THAT SO VIOLENTLY MOVED ME.

I HESITATE TO TELL YOU BUT WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW IS NOTHING MORE THAN LIVE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU DESERVE BY WHAT YOU ARE A HAPPINESS A FULLNESS THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW. YET TODAY THIS FULLNESS IS NOT DEAD IT IS A PART OF LIFE AND TO ITS CREDIT IT REIGNS OVER YOU WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO OR NOT. BUT IN THE COMING DAYS YOU MUST LIVE ALONE WITH THIS HOLE THIS PAINFUL MEMORY. THIS LIFELESSNESS THAT WE ALL CARRY INSIDE OF US-BY US I MEAN TO SAY THOSE WHO ARE NOT TAKEN TO THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS AND WHO PAINFULLY REMEMBER ANOTHER KIND OF HAPPINESS THAT GOES BEYOND'I THE MEMORY.

SOMETIMES FOR VIOLENT MINDS THE TIME THAT WE TEAR OFF FOR WORK THAT IS TORN AWAY FROM TIME IS THE BEST. AN UNFORTUNATE PASSION.

X. HIS ROTUND COMRADE REPEATS A SENTENCE FROM THE NOVEL HE IS READING: "LIVE EACH HOUR AS IF IT WERE TO BE THE LAST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL" AND HE WRITES: "THAT'S IT EXACTLY." BUT X. SAYS: HE DOESN'T EVEN LEAVE HIS ROOM TO VISIT THE CITY AND HE DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN FINE MEALS AND HIS BED.

HER COMPANION-WITH HIS ATHLETIC [. . .]9-CANNOT MAKE LOVE BEFORE THE MATCH BECAUSE HE MUSE KEEP HIS STRENGTH NOR AFTER BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEFT; FOR THE SAME REASONS HE DOES NOT GO OUT. IN THE MORNING HE WAKES HER WITH A KNEE TO THE SMALL OF THE BACK SO THAT SHE WILL GO MAKE BREAKFAST.... SHE: "I DON'T HAVE SEX I DON'T GO OUT I'M THE MAID AND THIS HAS GONE ON FOR THREE YEARS."

22.24.
NOTHING. RECORDED FALL ON MY TAPE RECORDER. MI'S LETTER ("VIOLENT AND PURE NIGHTS"). WANDERED YESTERDAY EVENING IN ST GERMAIN-DES-PRES-AWAITING WHAT? SPOKE WITH A DRUNK PAINTER "WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING-I'M NOT IN PRISONTHAT'S NEGATIVE-NO IT'S POSITIVE" AND HE SWALLOWS FIVE HARDBOILED EGGS SPRINKLED WITH COGNAC. DISTRESSED BY MY INABILITY TO WORK. FORTUNATELY ZHIVAGO2 AND THE FONDNESS I FEEL FOR ITS AUTHOR. GAVE UP TRIP TO THE MIDI.

25.
NOTHING. RECORDING FALL. POSSESSED DISTRIBUTED. N.R.F. DINNER WITH A.C. HIS ROMANCE WITH M. IMPOTENT WITH HIS WIFE WHICH M. REVEALS TO HER. "HE IS BETTER" SHE SAYS-"THAT IS" - "WELL HE IS NOT YET A MAN BUT HE IS NO LONGER AN OLD MAN EITHER." THIS POOL OF SHADOWS OVER THEIR LIVES. ALL LIVES. AFTER HAVING ACCOMPANIED HER BACK I STROLL IN ST GERMAIN-DESPRES. I WAIT STUPIDLY. AH! IF THE STRENGTH TO WORK RETURNED TO ME IT WOULD BE THE LIGHT FINALLY. THE LITTLE PUNKS DRESSED UP LIKE JAMES DEAN AND THE GESTURE OF THE HAND LIKE A SPOON THEIR RING FINGERS ARRANGING THEIR GENITALS APPARENTLY WEDGED TOO TIGHTLY IN THEIR BLUE JEANS. I THINK OF THE NAKED BROWN BODIES AGES AGO IN MY LOST COUNTRY. THEY WERE PURE.

26.
RECORDING FALL. BARELY BEGUN THE PREFACE FOR ISLANDS.' DINNER WITH C. LAZY AND CYNICAL TURNED ONLY TOWARD PLEASURE. BUT HE IS SELF-EMPLOYED. ALSO A SECOND-RATE WRITER. BUT HE BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANYBODY. I LEAVE HIM EARLY. HE GOES TO PLAY POKER WHICH BORES ME AND I GO HOME. EARLIER: A RATHER INELEGANT GIRL PURSUED BY AN ARAB REJECTS HIM. "I AM RACIST" SHE SAYS SIMPLY.

27.
FINISHED RECORDING FALL. DON GIOVANNI. GREY SKY ALL DAY. EVENING FILM ABOUT SOCCER'S WORLD CUP. THE YOUNG BLACK BRAZILIANS CRYING AFTER THE VICTORY AND TRYING TO HIDE THEIR FACES FROM THE CAMERA. AS BEFORE THIS STILL TOUCHES AND MOVES ME.

ALGERIA OBSESSES ME THIS MORNING. TOO LATE TOO LATE ... MY LAND LOST I WOULD BE WORTH NOTHING.

JULY 30.
SOLITARY DAY. SHAPELESS WORK. THE EVENING THROUGH NABOKOV NARAYAN-WHO COULD BE GANDHI'S SUCCESSOR-EXPLAINS TO US THE MOVEMENT OF VILLAGER AND AGRARIAN SOCIALISM IN THE INDIES (VINOBA).4 I ADMIRE DISTANTLY. BACK HOME PASSING IN FRONT OF THE AIGLON I SEE A.M.'S NAME ON THE ILLUMINATED MARQUEE. I ENTER. ELEVEN YEARS AGO I HAD HAPPINESS WITH HER. MARRIED NOW TO AN AIR FRANCE STEWARD WITH WHOM SHE GOES FISHING. AND SHE SINGS EVERY EVENING.

JULY 31.
IN THE AFTERNOON A.M. COMES TO SEE ME FOR A HALF-HOUR. IN THE DAYLIGHT I SEE THE TRACES LEFT BY ELEVEN YEARS. SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD THEREFORE SHE IS 33. BUT WE LAUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

AUGUST 1ST.
LUNCH AT BARRAULT'S PLACE IN CHAMBOURCY. THE SKY IS CONSTANTLY BLACK FROM A STORM THAT NEVER BREAKS. B. AGAIN PROPOSES TO ME THE DANTCHENKO-STANISLAVSKI5 ASSOCIATION. IN THE AFTERNOON COLIN WILSONTI - A BABY; OBVIOUSLY EUROPE HAS CONQUERED ENGLAND. "WE MUST NOW COMMUNICATE FAITH IN [. . .]7 [ KNOW IT WELL. THIS FAITH IS MINE; IT HAS NEVER LEFT ME. BUT I HAVE TAKEN THE PATH OF THE ERA-WITH ITS FRUSTRATIONS-SO AS NOT TO CHEAT AND AFFIRM AFTER HAVING SHARED IN SUFFERING AND DENIAL JUST AS I HAD ACTUALLY FELT IT. NOW WE MUST TRANSFIGURE AND THIS IS WHAT DISTRESSES ME IN THE FACE OF THIS BOOK THAT I MUST MAKE AND THAT BINDS ME. PERHAPS THE PAINTING OF A CERTAIN DISTRESS HAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED THE MEN OF MY AGE AND WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUR TRUE FAITH. WE WILL ONLY HAVE PREPARED THE TERRAIN FOR THE BOYS WHO FOLLOW US. I SAY TO C.W. AND "IF I DID NOT SUCCEED I'LL HAVE BEEN AN INTERESTING WITNESS AT BEST. IF I DID SUCCEED I'LL HAVE BEEN A CREATOR."

IN THE EVENING I DINE WITH A.E. AND KARIN THEN STROLL TO MONTMARTRE WITH JUST KARIN. THE GARDENS IN THE NIGHT WASHED BENEATH THE MOON BUT DARK. KARIN IS 18 YEARS OLD. PARENTS DIVORCED. SHE LEFT SWEDEN I DON'T KNOW WHY AND EARNED HER LIVING AS A MODEL FOR A SECOND-RATE DESIGNER WHO EXPLOITED HER. THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS FOR SEVEN HOURS OF WORK A DAY. THE COURAGE OF THESE GIRLS OF THE HALF-CENTURY IT ALWAYS FILLS ME WITH THE SAME ADMIRATION. BEAUTY A LITTLE BOYISH BUT SLOW AS IF ABSENT. RETURN. HER NATURALNESS. SHE IMMEDIATELY ADVANCES HER TENDER MOUTH THEN LEAVES PRECISE AND RESERVED.

AUGUST 2.
I FORCE MYSELF TO WRITE THIS DIARY BUT MY RELUCTANCE IS EXQUISITE. I KNOW NOW WHY I NEVER KEPT A PERSONAL DIARY: FOR ME LIFE IS SECRETIVE. WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS (AND THAT IS WHAT PAINED X. SO MUCH) BUT ALSO LIFE MUST BE LIVED THROUGH MY OWN EYES I MUST NOT REVEAL IT IN WORDS. UNHEARD AND UNEXPOSED LIKE THIS IT IS RICH FOR ME. IF I FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP A PERSONAL DIARY AT THIS MOMENT IT IS OUT OF PANIC IN THE FACE OF MY FAILING MEMORY. BUT I AM NOT SURE I CAN CONTINUE. BESIDES EVEN SO I FORGET TO NOTE MANY THINGS. AND I SAY NOTHING OF WHAT I THINK. HENCE MY LONG REFLECTION IN REGARD TO K.

SATURDAY 2.

AFTERNOON M. LONG CONVERSATION. FEW PEOPLE HAVE GONE FURTHER THAN HER IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF LIFE. THE 6TH. GO OUT IN THE EVENING WITH MICHEL ANNE AND M. DANCE. THE 7TH. AGAIN THE FEELING OF DISTANCE FROM M. THE MOST PASSIONATE PERSON WHOM I HAVE KNOWN IS IN FACT THE MOST CHASTE. DINNER WITH THE RUSSIAN NURSE AND HER NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL AT BRICE PARAIN'S9 PLACE. B.P. LIKE ALL RELIGIOUS MINDS TRIES TO JUST'IFY ALL MISFORTUNES BY THE NECESSARY ATONEMENT. I TELL HIM THAT IN ANY CASE WE MEET ALL THAT IS WORST IN DIALECTICS. HE KNOWS THIS. HE REFLECTS.

FRIDAY 8.
SOLITARY DAY LIKE MOST OF THE PRECEDING ONES. I TRY TO ORGANIZE MY WORK. IT HAS RAINED FOR 2 DAYS. LETTER FROM X.: "WELL-OILED AND INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS" (ON THE TELEPHONE). WARM FREE TRUTHFUL.

SUNDAY 9.1
SICK. SUNDAY THE 10TH. MONDAY THE 11TH. LA CORDE. I LIE DOWN AND FALL ASLEEP WITH A DREADFUL HEADACHE. BAD NIGHT. DURING THE DAY MI TELEPHONES FROM MARSEILLE; SHE RUNS FROM ONE CITY TO THE NEXT PURSUED BY ANGUISH AND PANIC. I ADVISE HER TO RETURN TO PARIS.

PHYSICALLY HE HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. BUT SINCE HIS NERVOUS BREAKDOWN THE DRIVE HAS DISAPPEARED. HE LIVES BY HEART ALONE OBVIOUSLY. WE BUMP INTO K. HER NATURALNESS SUFFOCATES ME (THE UNRESERVED HAND AND THEN COME ALONG NO WHY I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT) SHE EATS NONSTOP.

AUGUST 15 16 17.
THIS WHOLE PERIOD SINCE THE 2ND IS IN FACT EMPTY. ONE CANNOT WRITE WITHOUT RECOVERING VITALITY AND ENERGY-THE HEART'S HEALTH-EVEN IF WHAT ONE MUST SAY IS TRAGIC. PARTICULARLY SO. FINISHED ZHIVAGO WITH A SORT OF TENDERNESS FOR THE AUTHOR. IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THIS BOOK AGAIN TAKES UP THE XIXTH CENTURY'S RUSSIAN ARTISTIC TRADITION. IT'S MUCH MORE GAUCHE AND MODERN IN COMPOSITION WITH ITS CONTINUAL SNAPSHOTS. BUT HE DOES BETTER: HE RESUSCITATES THE RUSSIAN HEART CRUSHED BENEATH FORTY YEARS OF WATCHWORDS AND HUMANITARIAN CRUELTIES. ZHIVAGO IS A BOOK OF LOVE. AND OF SUCH LOVE THAT IT IS POURED OUT UPON ALL PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME. THE DOCTOR LOVES HIS WIFE AND LARA AND OTHERS STILL AND RUSSIA. IF HE DIES HE IS TO BE SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE FROM LARA FROM RUSSIA AND FROM ALL THE REST.

PEOPLE WITHOUT NAME ARE NEAR TO ME TREES CHILDREN AND SEDENTARIES I AM OVERCOME BY ALL OF THESE AND THAT ALONE IS MY VICTORY.'

AND PASTERNAK'S COURAGE WAS TO REDISCOVER THIS TRUE SOURCE OF CREATION AND TO WORK AT IT SLOWLY IN ORDER TO MAKE IT GUSH OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT.

WHAT ELSE? THE EVENINGS OF THE 16TH AND THE 15TH RECORDED THE POEMS OF CHAR WITH M. NIGHT OF THE 15TH STROLL ALONG THE SEINE. BENEATH THE PONT NEUF YOUNG FOREIGNERS (SCANDINAVIANS) ARE JOINED TOGETHER AROUND TWO OF THEIR OWN A TRUMPETER AND A BANJO PLAYER AND LIE ON THE STREET COUPLES EMBRACING LISTENING TO THE IMPROVISATION.

AUGUST 23.

29.
C. RETURNS.

SEPTEMBER 2 AT ISLE-SUR-SORGUE. BEST RULE FOR THIS NOTEBOOK: TO SUMMARIZE FROM TIME TO TIME (2 TIMES PER WEEK?) THE IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE PAST PERIOD. SATURDAY THE 30TH I SAW JAMOIS7 AND AGREED WITH HER THAT I COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY PRESENT THE POSSESSED IN MONTPARNASSE. DESPITE HER DRYNESS AND AIR OF BITTERNESS SHE HAS CHARM WITH HER PROPER SANDALS HER SMALL WELL-KEPT FEET HER LONG BODY AND THIS BEAUTIFUL SAD LOOK. TELEPHONED BARRAULT AFTERWARD TO TELL HIM OF MY AGREEMENT. SLEEP EARLY. I DON'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT FALL ASLEEP AT 3 A.M. WAKE UP AT 5 A.M. EAT A LOT AND BENEATH THE RAIN TAKE TO THE ROAD. I DON'T LEAVE THE STEERING WHEEL FOR ELEVEN HOURS-NIBBLING A BISCUIT FROM TIME TO TIME-AND THE RAIN DOESN'T LEAVE ME EITHER UNTIL I REACH THE DROME WHERE IT LETS UP A BIT OVER THE HEIGHTS OF NYONS SO THAT THE SCENT OF THE LAVENDER COMES TO ME AWAKENS ME AND ENLIVENS MY HEART. THE LANDSCAPE THAT I RECOGNIZE NOURISHES ME AGAIN AND I ARRIVE HAPPY. THE ISLE WHERE IN THE SCANTY ROOM AT THE HOTEL ST. MARTIN I FEEL AT ONCE SHELTERED AND PACIFIED.

MEET UP WITH RENE CHAR AT THE ISLE. SADNESS TO SEE HIM CHASED OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PARK (WHERE HIDEOUS H.L.M. BUILDINGS8 NOW RISE) AND STUCK IN THIS SMALL HOTEL ROOM AT ST. MARTIN. IN CAMPHOUX AT THE MATHIEU'S MME. MATHIEU AN AGED CLYTEMNESTRA WEARS GLASSES. AS FOR M. MATHIEU THE ESTATE MANAGER BECAME AN IMPOTENT OLD MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER EVEN CONTROL HIS EXPLOSIONS. I TAKE CARE OF THE RENTED HOUSE A BIT SAD BUT CHARMING HOWEVER WITH ITS VIEW OF THE LUBERON. SURELY IT WILL NOT PLEASE X. BUT I TRY TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE. 3 LONG WALKS WITH R.C. ON THE ROADS OF THE LUBERON PEAKS. THE VIOLENT LIGHT INFINITE SPACE MOVES ME. I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE HERE AGAIN FIND A HOUSE THAT SUITS ME FINALLY SETTLE DOWN A BIT. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK A LOT ABOUT MI. AND ABOUT HER LIFE HERE. AT DINNER MME. MATHIEU SAYS: "EVEN THE SWALLOWS HAVE BECOME FOOLISH. INSTEAD OF TAKING SILT FOR THEIR NESTS THEY TAKE THE CROP SOIL. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES TWELVE OF THE THIRTEEN NESTS IN CAMPHOUX HAVE BEEN CRUSHED ALONG WITH THEIR EGGS" AND CHAR: "ONE WOULD HOPE THAT AT LEAST THE BIRDS WOULD SALVAGE HONOR."

THE 4TH I AM STILL AWAITING A TELEGRAM OR TELEPHONE CALL FROM X. TELLING ME OF HER ARRIVAL WITH THE CHILDREN. IT IS MME. MATHIEU WHO TELLS ME THAT X. WILL ONLY STAY HERE FOR FOUR DAYS AND THAT HER FAMILY WILL BE IN PARIS. ANGER AND DISAFFECTION WHICH MOUNT AGAINST HER AND AGAINST ME WE WHO NEVER STOP WAITING FOR SIGNS OF TENDERNESS THERE WHERE THERE ARE NONE AND CANNOT BE ANY.

SEPTEMBER 30.
A MONTH AFTER LOOKING AROUND THE VAUCLUSE FOR A HOUSE PURCHASED THE ONE IN LOURMARIN. THEN OFF TOWARD ST. JEAN TO FIND MI. FOR HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS THROUGH THE SCENT OF THE GRAPE HARVEST ELATION.

ALWAYS THE SAME IMPRESSION OVER THIS LAND OF MAISON-BLANCHE4: MY LAND. AND YET THE SKY IS GREY THE AIR GENTLE AND SPONGY. I SETTLE AT THE CLINIC ON THE HEIGHTS OF ALGIERS.

IN THE SPOTLESS ROOM WITH BARE WHITE WALLS: NOTHING. A HANDKERCHIEF AND A SMALL COMB. ON THE SHEETS: HER KNOTTY HANDS. OUTSIDE AN ADMIRABLE LANDSCAPE THAT EXTENDS TO THE GULF. BUT THE LIGHT AND SPACE BOTHER HER. SHE WANTS THE ROOM TO BE KEPT SHADED.

SHE SPEAKS OF PHILIPPE TO WHOM PAULE HAS JUST BECOME ENGAGED: "HIS FATHER IS GOOD HIS MOTHER IS GOOD HIS SISTER IS GOOD. THEY ARE ANCIENT PEOPLE. HE HE HAS DONE HIS DUTY. HE HAS SEEN PAULE TO THE PETROLEUM AND (GESTURE OF TWO INDEX FINGERS COMING TOGETHER). ALL THE BETTER."

"LATER WHEN I AM AT HOME THE DOCTOR WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO RECOVER." SHE SAYS "THANK YOU MONSIEUR DOCTOR." SHE CANNOT DO ANYTHING: NEITHER READ SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW NOR SEW OR EMBROIDER BECAUSE OF HER FINGERS NOR LISTEN SINCE SHE IS DEAF. TIME DRIPS HEAVY SLOW . . .

HER LIPS HAVE DISAPPEARED. BUT HER NOSE SO FINE SO STRAIGHT-HER LARGE FOREHEAD FULL OF NOBILITY HER BRILLIANT BLACK EYES IN THE BONY AND SHINING ARCH.

SHE SUFFERS SILENTLY. SHE OBEYS. AROUND HER THE FAMILY SITS DENSE MUTE AND WAITING. . . . HER BROTHER JOSEPH YOUNGER BY A FEW YEARS ALSO WAITS-BUT AS HE WOULD WAIT FOR HIS TURN-RESIGNED AND SAD.

MARCH 23.
BAD NIGHT. IT RAINS IN THE MORNING OVER THE GULF AND THE HILLS. THE WISTERIAS: THEY FILLED MY YOUTH WITH THEIR SCENT WITH THEIR RICH AND MYSTERIOUS ARDOR.... AGAIN ENDLESSLY.

ARRIVAL LOURMARIN. GREY SKY. IN THE GARDEN MARVELOUS ROSES WEIGHED DOWN BY WATER LUSCIOUS LIKE FRUITS. THE ROSEMARY IS IN BLOOM. STROLL AND IN THE EVENING THE IRISES' VIOLET SHADE DEEPENS. WORN OUT.

FOR YEARS I'VE WANTED TO LIVE ACCORDING TO EVERYONE ELSE'S MORALS. I'VE FORCED MYSELF TO LIVE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE TO LOOK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I SAID WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO JOIN TOGETHER EVEN WHEN I FELT SEPARATE. AND AFTER ALL OF THIS CATASTROPHE CAME. NOW I WANDER AMID THE DEBRIS I AM LAWLESS TORN TO PIECES ALONE AND ACCEPTING TO BE SO RESIGNED TO MY SINGULARITY AND TO MY INFIRMITIES. AND I MUST REBUILD A TRUTH-AFTER HAVING LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN A SORT OF LIE.

HANG ON TO THIS PRECIOUS TREMOR THIS TOTAL SILENCE THAT I HAVE FOUND HERE. THE REST DOES NOT MATTER.

FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF MYSELF OF WHAT I BELIEVED OF WHAT I LIVED. THIS IS WHY THOSE WHO SHARE THE SAME IDEAS BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE THE TARGET AND BEAR SUCH AN INTENSE GRUDGE AGAINST ME; BUT NO I WAGE WAR WITH MYSELF AND I WILL DESTROY MYSELF OR I WILL BE REBORN THAT IS ALL.

THIS IS THE RED SEASON. CHERRIES AND POPPIES.

AT NOON THE SOUND OF A TRACTOR IN THE SMALL VALLEY OF LOURMARIN ... LIKE THAT OF THE BOAT'S ENGINE IN THE PORT OF CHIOS OVERPOWERED BY THE HEAT AND I WAS IN THE SHADE-FILLED CABIN WAITING; YES LIKE TODAY FULL OF A LOVE WITHOUT OBJECT.6

I LOVE THE SMALL LIZARDS AS DRY AS THE STONES WHERE THEY RUN. THEY ARE LIKE ME OF SKIN AND BONE.

PARIS JUNE '59.
I HAVE ABANDONED THE MORAL POINT OF VIEW. MORALS LEAD TO ABSTRACTION AND TO INJUSTICE. THEY ARE THE MOTHER OF FANATICISM AND BLINDNESS. WHOEVER IS VIRTUOUS MUST CUT OFF THE HEADS. BUT WHAT TO SAY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS MORALITY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO LIVE UP TO ITS HIGH STANDARDS. THE HEADS FALL AND HE LEGISLATES UNFAITHFUL. MORALITY CUTS IN TWO SEPARATES WASTES AWAY. ONE MUST FLEE MORALITY ACCEPT BEING JUDGED AND NOT JUDGING SAYING YES CREATING UNITY-AND FOR THE TIME BEING SUFFERING AGONY.

THE CITY DRUNK WITH HEAT.

VENICE FROM JULY 6 TO JULY 13.7

THE HEAVY AND DEAD HEAT LIKE AN ENORMOUS SPONGE WAS CRUSHING THE LAGOON CUTTING THE HIDEAWAY FROM THE SIDE OF THE PONT DE LA LIBERTE AND INSTALLED ABOVE THE CITY WEIGHED ON IT OBSTRUCTING THE OUTLETS OF THE STREETS AND CANALS FILLING ALL THE FREE SPACE BETWEEN THE CLOSELY SITUATED HOUSES. NO EXIT DOOR NO ESCAPE A HEAT TRAP WHERE WE MUST LIVE AND GO ROUND IN CIRCLES. AN ARMY OF HIDEOUS TOURISTS TURNED THUS FURIOUSLY CRAZED SWEATING SAVAGE DRESSED GROTESQUELY LIKE THE TERRIBLE TROUPE OF AN IMMENSE CIRCUS SUDDENLY IDLE AND TERRIFIED TO BE SO. THE WHOLE CITY WAS DRUNK WITH HEAT. IN THE MORNING WE READ IN 11 GAZZATTINO THAT SOME VENETIANS DRIVEN CRAZY BY THE HEAT HAD BEEN SENT TO THE INSANE ASYLUM. EXHAUSTED CATS WERE EVERYWHERE. OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THEM ROSE RISKING A FEW STEPS ON THE BURNING CAMPO AND AT ONCE THE SOFT AND MALICIOUS SUN WHICH WAS ON THE LOOKOUT KNOCKED IT DOWN. RATS HOISTED THEMSELVES ABOVE THE CANALS' STAGNANT WATERS AND THREE SECONDS LATER FELL BACK INTO THE WATER EN MASSE. THIS SOFT AND BURNING HEAT SEEMED TO EAT AWAY AT THE INCREASINGLY DECREPIT CITY THE PEELING SPLENDOR OF THE PALACES THE BURNING CAMPOS THE MOLDY FOUNDATIONS AND PILES OF MOORING AND VENICE PLUNGES A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE LAGOON.

WE WANDERED FOR OUR PART UNABLE TO EAT AND WE NOURISHED OURSELVES WITH COFFEES AND ICE CREAMS UNABLE TO SLEEP AND WE NO LONGER KNEW WHERE THE DAYS AND NIGHTS BEGAN AND ENDED. THE DAY SURPRISED US ON THE LIDO BEACH IN THE TEPID AND VISCOUS MORNING WATER OR ON A GONDOLA WANDERING IN THE LOST CANALS WHILE THE SKY BECAME A GREYISH PINK ABOVE THE SUDDENLY TURQUOISE TILES. THE CITY WAS EMPTY THEN BUT THE HEAT DID NOT LET UP NEITHER AT THIS HOUR NOR IN THE EVENING HOUR ALWAYS STEADY ALWAYS BURNING AND HUMID AND VENICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED WHILE GIVING UP HOPE OF EVER LEAVING WE LOOKED ONLY TO BREATHE ONE MORE TIME AND ANOTHER STILL IN SHORT TO LAST IN THIS STRANGE TIME WITHOUT LANDMARKS NOR REST NERVES ON EDGE FROM COFFEE AND INSOMNIA TORN FROM LIFE. BEINGS BEYOND TIME BUT BEINGS LIKEWISE THAT NO ONE NOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD DESIRED OTHER THAN IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS CRAZED AND IMMOBILE INSANITY IN THE CENTER OF THE FROZEN FIRE THAT DEVOURED VENICE HOUR AFTER HOUR ENDLESSLY AND AT THIS POINT WHERE WE WAITED FOR THE INSTANT WHEN SUDDENLY THE CITY EARLIER STILL GLITTERING WITH COLORS AND BEAUTY WOULD SINK INTO ASHES WHICH NOT EVEN THE ABSENT WIND WOULD CARRY AWAY. WE WAITED HANGING ON TO ONE ANOTHER UNABLE TO SEPARATE OURSELVES BURNING ALSO BUT WITH A SORT OF INTERMINABLE AND STRANGE JOY ON THIS PYRE OF BEAUTY.

THUS I HAVE CHOSEN YOU AND THIS IS WHAT WILL HELP ME PASS THIS BAD PERIOD TO NO LONGER SUFFER FROM THE DETAILS OF WHAT I RECOGNIZE AS JUST AND LEGITIMATE IN PRINCIPLE....

WHAT ALSO HELPED ME-EQUITY-THIS DIFFICULT ACCEPTANCE OF ONESELF AND OTHERS IS CREATION. BUT SINCE I AM IN THIS CRISIS IN THIS SORT OF IMPOTENCE I UNDERSTAND THIS IGNOBLE DESIRE FOR POSSESSION THAT IN OTHERS HAS ALWAYS INCENSED ME. ONE CAN CONQUER A BEING FOR LACK OF BEING CONQUERED ONESELF. AND IT IS TRUE THAT AT PRECISELY THIS MOMENT I HAVE NEED OF THIS BELONGING THAT YOU HAD GIVEN ME. FOR THIS REASON AS MUCH AS FOR YOUR EVASION I HAVE SUFFERED FROM YOUR LIE. BUT THIS WILL PASS. A LITTLE MORE PESSIMISM STILL AND UNHAPPINESS WILL RADIATE :IN TURN: I WILL BECOME MYSELF AGAIN.

I HAVE SUFFERED FROM WHAT YOU REVEALED TO ME: THAT'S A FACT. BUT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE SAD FOR MY SADNESS. I AM WRONG I KNOW IT AND IF I CANNOT PREVENT MY HEART FROM BEING UNJUST I CAN AT LEAST MAKE IT CAPABLE OF EQUITY. IT WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO OVERCOME THE INJUSTICE THAT I DO TO YOU IN MY HEART. I KNOW THAT I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING TO DETACH YOU FROM ME. ALL MY LIFE AS SOON AS A PERSON GOT ATTACHED TO ME I DID EVERYTHING TO DISTANCE THEM. THERE IS OF COURSE THE INCAPACITY WHEREIN I AM TO MAKE COMMITMENTS MY TASTE FOR PEOPLE OF MULTIPLICITY MY PESSIMISM WITH REGARD TO MYSELF. BUT PERHAPS I WAS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS I SAY. THE FIRST PERSON WHOM I LOVED AND I WAS FAITHFUL TO ESCAPED ME THROUGH DRUGS THROUGH BETRAYAL. MAYBE MANY THINGS CAME FROM THIS FROM VANITY FROM FEAR OF SUFFERING FURTHER AND YET I'VE ACCEPTED SO MUCH SUFFERING. BUT I HAVE IN TURN ESCAPED FROM EVERYONE SINCE AND IN A CERTAIN WAY I WANTED EVERYONE TO ESCAPE FROM ME. EVEN X. I HAVE DONE WHATEVER NECESSARY TO DISCOURAGE HER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SHE ESCAPED ME THAT SHE GAVE HERSELF EVEN FLEETINGLY TO ANOTHER MAN. I AM NOT SURE [...].11 BUT IF SHE DID NOT DO IT IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF A DECISION DUE TO HER INNER HEROISM NOT BECAUSE OF AN OVERABUNDANCE OF A LOVE THAT WANTS TO GIVE WITHOUT ASKING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE. SO I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ESCAPE FROM ME. AND THE MORE THE CAPTIVATION OF THAT SEPTEMBER INCREASED THE MORE I WANTED TO BREAK A CERTAIN ENCHANTMENT. THUS IN A CERTAIN WAY YOU HAVE ESCAPED ME. THAT IS THE SOMETIMES AWFUL JUSTICE OF THIS WORLD. BETRAYAL ANSWERS BETRAYAL THE MASK OF LOVE IS ANSWERED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF LOVE. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I WHO HAVE CLAIMED AND LIVED ALL LIBERTIES I KNOW AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS RIGHT AND GOOD THAT IN YOUR TURN YOU HAVE LIVED ONE OR TWO LIBERTIES. THE COUNT IS NOT EVEN COMPLETE.

TO HELP MYSELF IN ANY CASE I WILL NOT ONLY HELP MYSELF TO THIS COLD EQUITY OF THE HEART BUT TO THE PREFERENCE TO THE TENDERNESS THAT I CARRY FOR YOU. I SOMETIMES ACCUSE MYSELF OF BEING INCAPABLE OF LOVE. MAYBE THIS IS TRUE BUT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELECT A FEW PEOPLE AND TO KEEP FOR THEM FAITHFULLY THE BEST OF ME NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO.

IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF DECEMBER 1959 ALBERT CAMUS TOLD HIS FRIEND URBAIN POLGE: "WHAT PLEASES ME IS THAT I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE CEMETERY WHERE I WILL BE BURIED. I WILL BE FINE THERE." STRUGGLING WITH HIS WRITING CAMUS SENT A LETTER TO CATHERINE SELLERS IN WHICH HE WROTE: "TO WORK ONE MUST DEPRIVE ONESELF AND DIE WITHOUT AID. SO LET'S DIE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT WORKING...." ON DECEMBER 30 HE WROTE A LINE TO MARIA CASARES REGARDING HIS RETURN TO PARIS WHICH HAD THE LINE BEEN WRITTEN IN ONE OF HIS NOVELS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SEEMED TO STRETCH BELIEVABILITY: "LET'S SAY [TUESDAY] IN PRINCIPLE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SURPRISES ON THE ROAD ..... I

AND IT WAS ON THE ROAD FIVE DAYS AFTER THOSE WORDS WERE WRITTEN-JANUARY 4 1960-THAT THE DASHBOARD CLOCK OF MICHEL GALLIMARD'S 1959 FACEL VEGA HK 500 STOPPED TICKING AT 1:55 E.NI. THE CLOCK LAY IN A NEARBY FIELD. FRAGMENTS OF THE WRECKAGE SPREAD ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED FEET. A TIRE SAT ALONE ON THE SCARRED CEMENT. DRIZZLE DOTTED THE ROAD. A BLACK LEATHER VALISE LAY IN THE MUD TOSSED NEXT TO THE TREE AROUND WHICH THE CAR WAS WRAPPED.

WEDGED INTO THE BACK WINDSHIELD OF THE WRECKED AUTOMOBILE WAS THE BODY OF ALBERT CAMUS A LONG SCRATCH ETCHED ALONG HIS FOREHEAD HIS EYES STRETCHED OPEN. KILLED INSTANTLY. OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH: "FRACTURE OF THE SKULL AND SPINAL COLUMN."

HE WAS FORTY-SIX.

IN TIME CAMUS' MUD-CAKED VALISE WAS RETURNED TO HIS WIFE FRANCINE. WHEN SHE OPENED THE BRIEFCASE-CAMUS NEVER USED THE LOCK-SHE FOUND SEVERAL ITEMS OF NOTE INCLUDING A FRENCH TRANSLATION OF NIETZSCHE'S THE GAY SCIENCE AND A COPY OF SHAKESPEARE'S OTHELLO ALSO IN A FRENCH TRANS- LATION.2 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IT IS BELIEVED CAMUS HAD BEGUN WORKING IN EARNEST ON HIS ADAPTATION OF THE SHAKESPEAREAN TRAGEDY AS LATER IN A VALISE SENT BY TRAIN MME. CAMUS DISCOVERED A TYPED TRANSCRIPT OF THE PLAY WHICH HAD HER HUSBAND'S HANDWRITTEN REVISIONS AND MARKINGS THROUGHOUT THE FIRST THREE ACTS.'

NONETHELESS THESE BOOKS WERE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS IN THE MUDDY BRIEFCASE. AMONG CAMUS' PASSPORT PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND LETTERS ALSO INSIDE THE VALISE WAS THE LAST VOLUME OF THESE NOTEBOOKS (IX) WHICH HE CARRIED WITH HIM LITERALLY UNTIL HIS DEATH. AND THEN THERE WAS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST DISCOVERY: LE PREMIER HOMME4 THE LARGELY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT CAMUS HAD HOPED WOULD BE HIS BIG BOOK HIS WAR AND PEACE. WHEN IT WAS RECOVERED THERE WERE 144 PAGES AN INCOMPLETE FIRST DRAFT SCRAWLED IN HIS SMALL TIGHT SCRIPT OFTEN WITHOUT PERIODS OR COMMAS. FOR YEARS THIS DRAFT REMAINED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1.994 THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE FRENCH JOURNAL ARTS SARCASTICALLY WROTE OF CAMUS "'LE NOBEL COURONNE UNE OEUVRE TERMINEE THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD FINALLY BE OFFERED A GLIMPSE OF THIS LAST UNFINISHED MANUSCRIPT AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES THAT ARTS HAD BEEN WRONG.

IN HER INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION OF LE PREMIER HOMME CAMUS' DAUGHTER CATHERINE ACKNOWLEDGED THE HOSTILE ATTITUDES TOWARD HER FATHER WHICH SEEMED TO PERMEATE FRANCE AT THE TIME AS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THE MANUSCRIPT WAS NOT PUBLISHED SOONER. BUT WHEN THE MANUSCRIPT WAS FINALLY PUBLISHED INSTEAD OF DRAWING THE CENSURE OF PAST POLITICAL FOES THE BOOK MET WITH WIDESPREAD CRITICAL ACCLAIM SHOWING ARTS AND OTHER POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CRITICS THAT CAMUS CLEARLY HAD MUCH LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE. EVEN THOUGH AFTER WINNING THE NOBEL PRIZE ONLY THE POSSESSED AND A HANDFUL OF ESSAYS WERE PUBLISHED WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE WE CAN SEE IN LE PREMIER HOMME THE PROMISE THAT CAMUS' BEST WORK MAY HAVE BEEN YET TO COME.

IN ADDITION TO LE PREMIER HOMME WE CAN SEE IN THESE NOTEBOOKS THE BEGINNINGS OF SEVERAL PROJECTS CAMUS HAD PLANNED AND BEGUN TAKING NOTES FOR. THERE WERE THE TWO PLAYS: ONE CONCERNING THE LIFE OF JULIE DE LESPINASSE AND THE OTHER ATTEMPTING TO BLEND THE LEGEND OF DON JUAN WHICH HAD PREOCCUPIED CAMUS FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE WITH THAT OF FAUST. THEN THERE WAS THE ESSAY ON NEMESIS WHO CAMUS SAW AS THE GODDESS OF MODERATION AND ON WHOM HE HAD PLANNED TO CENTER HIS NEXT MAJOR WRITING CYCLE. LIKE THE PREVIOUS CYCLES-THE FIRST ON THE ABSURD THE SECOND ON REVOLT-THIS CYCLE ON LOVE WAS TO INVOLVE A PLAY A NOVEL AND AN ESSAY.

ULTIMATELY THOUGH NONE OF THESE WORKS WOULD BE COMPLETED. AT THE POINT WHERE HE MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP OF HIS CRAFT CAMUS WAS REMOVED FROM THE WORLD AND WE WERE THUS FORCED TO ACCEPT AS JEAN-PAUL SARTRE WROTE IN HIS TRIBUTE 'O ALBERT CAMUS THAT "EVERY LIFE THAT IS CUT OFF-EVEN THE LIFE OF SO YOUNG A MAN-IS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME A PHONOGRAPH RECORD THAT IS BROKEN AND A COMPLETE LIFE."6

CAMUS SENSED THE IMMEDIACY AND CONSTANT PRESENCE OF DEATH AROUND HIM-HE KNEW ALL TOO WELL THAT HIS LUNGS WOULD LIKELY NOT ALLOW HIM TO LIVE TO OLD AGE-BUT WITH THE MANY WEIGHTS BEARING ON HIM AT THE TIME WHAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO SURE OF WHAT WE NOW KNOW WHAT WE SEE CLEARLY IS THAT HIS VOICE LIKE THE LAST WORDS OF HIS CALIGULA IS STILL ALIVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE LONG PAST HIS SHORTENED LIFE.

IRONY

TWO YEARS AGO I KNEW AN OLD WOMAN. SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM AN ILLNESS THAT HAD ALMOST KILLED HER. THE WHOLE OF HER RIGHT SIDE HAD BEEN PARALYZED. ONLY HALF OF HER WAS IN THIS WORLD WHILE THE OTHER WAS ALREADY FOREIGN TO HER. THIS BUSTLING CHATTERING OLD LADY HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY. ALONE DAY AFTER DAY ILLITERATE NOT VERY SENSITIVE HER WHOLE LIFE WAS REDUCED TO GOD. SHE BELIEVED IN HIM. THE PROOF IS THAT SHE HAD A ROSARY A LEAD STATUE OF CHRIST AND A STUCCO STATUE OF SAINT JOSEPH CARRYING THE INFANT JESUS. SHE DOUBTED HER ILLNESS WAS INCURABLE BUT SAID IT WAS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO HER. FOR EVERYTHING ELSE SHE RELIED ON THE GOD SHE LOVED SO POORLY.

ONE DAY SOMEONE DID PAY ATTENTION TO HER. A YOUNG MAN. (HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A TRUTH AND ALSO KNEW THAT THIS WOMAN WAS GOING TO DIE BUT DID NOT WORRY ABOUT SOLVING THIS CONTRADICTION.) HE HAD BECOME GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE OLD WOMAN’S BOREDOM. SHE FELT IT. AND HIS INTEREST WAS A GODSEND FOR THE INVALID. SHE WAS EAGER TO TALK ABOUT HER TROUBLES: SHE WAS AT THE END OF HER TETHER AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE WAY FOR THE RISING GENERATION. DID SHE GET BORED? OF COURSE SHE DID. NO ONE SPOKE TO HER. SHE HAD BEEN PUT IN HER CORNER LIKE A DOG. BETTER TO BE DONE WITH IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. SHE WOULD SOONER DIE THAN BE A BURDEN TO ANYONE.

HER VOICE HAD TAKEN ON A QUARRELSOME NOTE LIKE SOMEONE HAGGLING OVER A BARGAIN. STILL THE YOUNG MAN UNDERSTOOD. NONETHELESS HE THOUGHT BEING A BURDEN ON OTHERS WAS BETTER THAN DYING. WHICH PROVED ONLY ONE THING: THAT HE HAD SURELY NEVER BEEN A BURDEN TO ANY ONE. AND OF COURSE HE TOLD THE OLD LADY—SINCE HE HAD SEEN THE ROSARY: “YOU STILL HAVE GOD.” IT WAS TRUE. BUT EVEN HERE SHE HAD HER TROUBLES. IF SHE HAPPENED TO SPEND RATHER A LONG TIME IN PRAYER IF HER EYES STRAYED AND FOLLOWED A PATTERN IN THE WALLPAPER HER DAUGHTER WOULD SAY: “THERE SHE IS PRAYING AGAIN!” “WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS?” THE INVALID WOULD SAY. “IT’S NONE OF MY BUSINESS BUT EVENTUALLY IT GETS ON MY NERVES.” AND THE OLD WOMAN WOULD FALL SILENT CASTING A LONG REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HER DAUGHTER.

THE YOUNG MAN LISTENED TO ALL THIS WITH AN IMMENSE UNFAMILIAR PAIN THAT HURT HIS CHEST. AND THE OLD WOMAN WENT ON: “SHE’LL SEE WHEN SHE’S OLD. SHE’LL NEED IT TOO.”

YOU FELT THAT THIS OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN FREED OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT GOD WHOLLY ABANDONED TO THIS FINAL EVIL VIRTUOUS THROUGH NECESSITY TOO EASILY CONVINCED THAT WHAT STILL REMAINED FOR HER WAS THE ONLY THING WORTH LOVING FINALLY AND IRREVOCABLY PLUNGED INTO THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MAN IN GOD. BUT IF HOPE IN LIFE IS REBORN GOD IS POWERLESS AGAINST HUMAN INTERESTS.

THEY HAD SAT DOWN AT TABLE. THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN INVITED TO DINNER. THE OLD LADY WASN’T EATING BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIGEST IN THE EVENING. SHE HAD STAYED IN HER CORNER SITTING BEHIND THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO HER. AND BECAUSE HE FELT HE WAS BEING WATCHED HE COULDN’T EAT VERY MUCH. NEVERTHELESS THE DINNER PROGRESSED. THEY DECIDED TO EXTEND THE PARTY BY GOING TO THE CINEMA. AS IT HAPPENED THERE WAS A FUNNY FILM ON THAT WEEK. THE YOUNG MAN HAD BLITHELY ACCEPTED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON WHO CONTINUED TO EXIST BEHIND HIS BACK.

THE GUESTS HAD RISEN FROM TABLE TO GO AND WASH THEIR HANDS BEFORE LEAVING. THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO QUESTION OF THE OLD LADY’S GOING TOO. EVEN IF SHE HADN’T BEEN HALF-PARALYZED SHE WAS TOO IGNORANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FILM. SHE SAID SHE DIDN’T LIKE THE MOVIES. THE TRUTH WAS SHE COULDN’T UNDERSTAND THEM. IN ANY CASE SHE WAS IN HER CORNER VACANTLY ABSORBED IN THE BEADS OF HER ROSARY. THIS WAS WHERE SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST. THE THREE OBJECTS SHE KEPT NEAR HER REPRESENTED THE MATERIAL POINT WHERE GOD BEGAN. BEYOND AND BEHIND THE ROSARY THE STATUE OF CHRIST OR OF SAINT JOSEPH OPENED A VAST DEEP BLACKNESS IN WHICH SHE PLACED ALL HER HOPE.

EVERYONE WAS READY. THEY WENT UP TO THE OLD LADY TO KISS HER AND WISH HER A GOOD NIGHT. SHE HAD ALREADY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS CLUTCHING HER ROSARY TIGHTLY IN HER HAND. BUT IT WAS PLAIN THIS SHOWED AS MUCH DESPAIR AS ZEAL. EVERYONE ELSE HAD KISSED HER. ONLY THE YOUNG MAN WAS LEFT. HE HAD GIVEN HER AN AFFECTIONATE HANDSHAKE AND WAS ALREADY TURNING AWAY. BUT SHE SAW THAT THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD TAKEN AN INTEREST IN HER WAS LEAVING. SHE DIDN’T WANT TO BE ALONE. SHE COULD ALREADY FEEL THE HORROR OF LONELINESS THE LONG SLEEPLESS HOURS THE FRUSTRATING INTIMACY WITH GOD. SHE WAS AFRAID COULD NOW RELY ONLY ON MAN AND CLINGING TO THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN HER HELD ON TO HIS HAND SQUEEZING IT CLUMSILY THANKING HIM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THIS INSISTENCE. THE YOUNG MAN WAS EMBARRASSED. THE OTHERS WERE ALREADY TURNING ROUND TO TELL HIM TO HURRY UP. THE MOVIE BEGAN AT NINE AND IT WAS BETTER TO ARRIVE EARLY SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

HE FELT CONFRONTED BY THE MOST ATROCIOUS SUFFERING HE HAD EVER KNOWN: THAT OF A SICK OLD WOMAN LEFT BEHIND BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE MOVIES. HE WANTED TO LEAVE AND ESCAPE DIDN’T WANT TO KNOW TRIED TO DRAW BACK HIS HAND. FOR A MOMENT HE FELT AN INTENSE HATRED FOR THE OLD WOMAN AND ALMOST SLAPPED HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE.

FINALLY HE MANAGED TO GET AWAY WHILE THE INVALID HALF RISING FROM HER ARMCHAIR WATCHED WITH HORROR AS THE LAST CERTAINTY IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE FOUND REST FADED AWAY. NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO PROTECT HER. AND DEFENSELESS BEFORE THE IDEA OF DEATH SHE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TERRIFIED HER BUT FELT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE ALONE. GOD WAS OF NO USE TO HER. ALL HE DID WAS CUT HER OFF FROM PEOPLE AND MAKE HER LONELY. SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE WITHOUT PEOPLE. SO SHE BEGAN TO CRY.

THE OTHERS WERE ALREADY OUTSIDE IN THE STREET. THE YOUNG MAN WAS GRIPPED WITH REMORSE. HE LOOKED UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOW A GREAT DEAD EYE IN THE SILENT HOUSE. THE EYE CLOSED. THE OLD WOMAN’S DAUGHTER TOLD THE YOUNG MAN: “SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LIGHT OFF WHEN SHE’S BY HERSELF. SHE LIKES TO SIT IN THE DARK.”1

THE OLD MAN BROUGHT HIS EYEBROWS TRIUMPHANTLY TOGETHER WAGGLING A SENTENTIOUS FOREFINGER. “WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN” HE SAID “MY FATHER USED TO GIVE ME FIVE FRANCS A WEEK OUT OF MY WAGES AS POCKET MONEY TO LAST ME TILL THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY. WELL I STILL MANAGED TO SAVE. FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WENT TO SEE MY FIANCÉE I WALKED FOUR MILES THROUGH THE OPEN COUNTRY TO GET THERE AND FOUR MILES TO GET BACK. JUST YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW YOUNG MEN JUST DON’T KNOW HOW TO AMUSE THEMSELVES NOWADAYS.” THERE WERE THREE YOUNG MEN SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE WITH THIS ONE OLD MAN. HE WAS DESCRIBING HIS PETTY ADVENTURES—CHILDISH ACTIONS OVERBLOWN INCIDENTS OF LAZINESS CELEBRATED AS VICTORIES. HE NEVER PAUSED IN HIS STORY AND IN A HURRY TO TELL EVERYTHING BEFORE HIS AUDIENCE LEFT MENTIONED ONLY THOSE PORTIONS OF HIS PAST HE THOUGHT LIKELY TO IMPRESS THEM. MAKING PEOPLE LISTEN WAS HIS ONLY VICE: HE REFUSED TO NOTICE THE IRONY OF THE GLANCES AND THE SUDDEN MOCKERY THAT GREETED HIM. THE YOUNG MAN SAW IN HIM THE USUAL OLD BIRD FOR WHOM EVERYTHING WAS MARVELOUS IN HIS DAY WHILE HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE RESPECTED ELDER WHOSE EXPERIENCE CARRIES WEIGHT. THE YOUNG DON’T KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE IS A DEFEAT AND THAT WE MUST LOSE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO WIN A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. HE HAD SUFFERED. HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. IT’S BETTER TO SEEM HAPPY. AND IF HE WERE WRONG ABOUT THIS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE MISTAKEN TO TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM. WHAT DO AN OLD MAN’S SUFFERINGS MATTER WHEN LIFE ABSORBS YOU COMPLETELY? HE TALKED ON AND ON WANDERING BLISSFULLY THROUGH THE GRAYNESS OF HIS MUTTERINGS. BUT IT COULDN’T LAST. HE NEEDED AN ENDING AND THE ATTENTION OF HIS LISTENERS WAS WANING. HE WASN’T EVEN FUNNY ANY LONGER; HE WAS OLD. AND YOUNG MEN LIKE BILLIARDS AND CARDS WHICH TAKE THEIR MINDS OFF THE IMBECILITY OF EVERYDAY WORK.

SOON HE WAS ALONE DESPITE HIS EFFORTS AND THE LIES HE TOLD TO ENLIVEN HIS STORY. WITH NO ATTEMPT TO SPARE HIS FEELINGS THE YOUNG MEN HAD LEFT. ONCE AGAIN HE WAS ALONE. NO LONGER TO BE LISTENED TO: THAT’S THE TERRIBLE THING ABOUT BEING OLD. HE WAS CONDEMNED TO SILENCE AND LONELINESS. HE WAS BEING TOLD THAT HE WOULD SOON BE DEAD. AND AN OLD MAN WHO IS GOING TO DIE IS USELESS HE IS EVEN AN INSIDIOUS EMBARRASSMENT. LET HIM GO. HE OUGHT TO GO. OR IF NOT TO SHUT UP IS THE LEAST HE CAN DO. HE SUFFERS BECAUSE AS SOON AS HE STOPS TALKING HE REALIZES THAT HE IS OLD. YET HE DID GET UP AND GO SMILING TO EVERYONE AROUND HIM. BUT THE FACES HE SAW WERE EITHER INDIFFERENT OR CONVULSED BY A GAIETY THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO SHARE. A MAN WAS LAUGHING: “SHE’S OLD I DON’T DENY IT BUT SOMETIMES THE BEST STEWS ARE MADE IN OLD POTS.” ANOTHER ALREADY MORE SERIOUSLY: “WELL WE’RE NOT RICH BUT WE EAT WELL. LOOK AT MY GRANDSON NOW HE EATS MORE THAN HIS FATHER. HIS FATHER NEEDS A POUND OF BREAD HE NEEDS TWO! AND YOU CAN PILE ON THE SAUSAGE AND CAMEMBERT. AND SOMETIMES WHEN HE’S FINISHED HE SAYS: ‘HAN HAN!’ AND KEEPS ON EATING.” THE OLD MAN MOVED AWAY. AND WITH HIS SLOW STEP THE SHORT STEP OF THE DONKEY TURNING THE WHEEL HE WALKED THROUGH THE CROWDS OF MEN ON THE LONG PAVEMENTS. HE FELT ILL AND DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME. USUALLY HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO GET HOME TO HIS TABLE AND THE OIL LAMP THE PLATES WHERE HIS FINGERS MECHANICALLY FOUND THEIR PLACES. HE STILL LIKED TO EAT HIS SUPPER IN SILENCE THE OLD WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE CHEWING OVER EACH MOUTHFUL WITH AN EMPTY HEAD EYES FIXED AND DEAD. THIS EVENING HE WOULD ARRIVE HOME LATER. SUPPER WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED AND GONE COLD HIS WIFE WOULD BE IN BED NOT WORRYING ABOUT HIM SINCE SHE KNEW THAT HE OFTEN CAME HOME UNEXPECTEDLY LATE. SHE WOULD SAY: “HE’S IN THE MOON AGAIN” AND THAT WOULD BE THAT.

NOW HE WAS WALKING ALONG WITH HIS GENTLY INSISTENT STEP. HE WAS OLD AND ALONE. WHEN A LIFE IS REACHING ITS END OLD AGE WELLS UP IN WAVES OF NAUSEA. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO NOT BEING LISTENED TO ANY MORE. HE WALKS ALONG TURNS AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET STUMBLES AND ALMOST FALLS. I’VE SEEN HIM. IT’S RIDICULOUS BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT? AFTER ALL HE PREFERS BEING IN THE STREET BEING THERE RATHER THAN AT HOME WHERE FOR HOURS ON END FEVER VEILS THE OLD WOMAN FROM HIM AND ISOLATES HIM IN HIS ROOM. THEN SOMETIMES THE DOOR SLOWLY OPENS AND GAPES AJAR FOR A MOMENT. A MAN COMES IN. HE IS WEARING A LIGHT-COLORED SUIT. HE SITS DOWN FACING THE OLD MAN AND THE MINUTES PASS WHILE HE SAYS NOTHING. HE IS MOTIONLESS JUST LIKE THE DOOR THAT STOOD AJAR A MOMENT AGO. FROM TIME TO TIME HE STROKES HIS HAIR AND SIGHS GENTLY. WHEN HE HAS WATCHED THE OLD MAN FOR A LONG TIME WITH THE SAME HEAVY SADNESS IN HIS EYES HE LEAVES SILENTLY. THE LATCH CLICKS BEHIND HIM AND THE OLD MAN REMAINS HORRIFIED WITH AN ACID AND PAINFUL FEAR IN HIS STOMACH. OUT IN THE STREET HOWEVER FEW PEOPLE HE MAY MEET HE IS NEVER ALONE. HIS FEVER SINGS. HE WALKS A LITTLE FASTER: TOMORROW EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT TOMORROW. SUDDENLY HE REALIZES THAT TOMORROW WILL BE THE SAME AND AFTER TOMORROW ALL THE OTHER DAYS. AND HE IS CRUSHED BY THIS IRREPARABLE DISCOVERY. IT’S IDEAS LIKE THIS THAT KILL ONE. MEN KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT STAND THEM—OR IF THEY ARE YOUNG THEY TURN THEM INTO EPIGRAMS.

OLD MAD DRUNK NOBODY KNOWS. HIS WILL BE A WORTHY END TEAR-STAINED AND ADMIRABLE. HE WILL DIE LOOKING HIS BEST THAT IS TO SAY HE WILL SUFFER. THAT WILL BE A CONSOLATION FOR HIM. AND BESIDES WHERE CAN HE GO? HE WILL ALWAYS BE OLD NOW. MEN BUILD ON THEIR FUTURE OLD AGE. THEY TRY TO GIVE THIS OLD AGE BESIEGED BY HOPELESSNESS AN IDLENESS THAT LEAVES THEM WITH NO DEFENSE. THEY WANT TO BECOME FOREMEN SO THEY CAN RETIRE TO A LITTLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ONCE THEY ARE WELL ON IN YEARS THEY KNOW VERY WELL THIS IS A MISTAKE. THEY NEED OTHER MEN FOR PROTECTION. AND AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED HE NEEDED TO BE LISTENED TO IN ORDER TO BELIEVE IN HIS LIFE. THE STREETS WERE DARKER AND EMPTIER NOW. THERE WERE STILL VOICES GOING BY. IN THE STRANGE CALM OF EVENING THEY WERE BECOMING MORE SOLEMN. BEHIND THE HILLS ENCIRCLING THE TOWN THERE WERE STILL GLIMMERS OF DAYLIGHT. FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF SIGHT SMOKE ROSE IMPOSINGLY BEHIND THE WOODED HILLTOPS. IT ROSE SLOWLY IN THE SKY IN TIERS LIKE THE BRANCHES OF A PINE TREE. THE OLD MAN CLOSED HIS EYES. AS LIFE CARRIED AWAY THE RUMBLINGS OF THE TOWN AND THE HEAVENS SMILED THEIR FOOLISH INDIFFERENT SMILE HE WAS ALONE FORSAKEN NAKED ALREADY DEAD.

NEED I DESCRIBE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS FINE COIN? DOUBTLESS IN A DARK AND DIRTY ROOM THE OLD WOMAN WAS LAYING THE TABLE. WHEN DINNER WAS READY SHE SAT DOWN LOOKED AT THE CLOCK WAITED A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN BEGAN TO EAT A HEARTY MEAL. SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF: “HE IS IN THE MOON.” THAT WOULD BE THAT.

THERE WERE FIVE OF THEM LIVING TOGETHER: THE GRANDMOTHER HER YOUNGER SON HER ELDER DAUGHTER AND THE DAUGHTER’S TWO CHILDREN. THE SON WAS ALMOST DUMB; THE DAUGHTER AN INVALID COULD THINK ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY; AND OF THE TWO CHILDREN ONE WAS ALREADY WORKING FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY WHILE THE OTHER WAS CONTINUING HIS STUDIES. AT SEVENTY THE GRANDMOTHER STILL DOMINATED ALL THESE PEOPLE. ABOVE HER BED YOU COULD SEE A PORTRAIT TAKEN OF HER FIVE YEARS BEFORE UPRIGHT IN A BLACK DRESS THAT WAS HELD TOGETHER AT THE NECK BY A MEDALLION NOT A WRINKLE ON HER FACE. WITH ENORMOUS CLEAR COLD EYES SHE HAD A REGAL POSTURE SHE RELINQUISHED ONLY WITH INCREASING AGE BUT WHICH SHE STILL SOMETIMES TRIED TO RECOVER WHEN SHE WENT OUT.

IT WAS THESE CLEAR EYES THAT HELD A MEMORY FOR HER GRANDSON WHICH STILL MADE HIM BLUSH. THE OLD WOMAN WOULD WAIT UNTIL THERE WERE VISITORS AND WOULD ASK THEN LOOKING AT HIM SEVERELY “WHOM DO YOU LIKE BEST? YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR GRANDMOTHER?” THE GAME WAS EVEN BETTER WHEN THE DAUGHTER WAS PRESENT. FOR THE CHILD WOULD ALWAYS REPLY: “MY GRANDMOTHER” WITH IN HIS HEART A GREAT SURGE OF LOVE FOR HIS EVER SILENT MOTHER. THEN WHEN THE VISITORS WERE SURPRISED AT THIS PREFERENCE THE MOTHER WOULD SAY: “IT’S BECAUSE SHE’S THE ONE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP.”

IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE THE OLD WOMAN THOUGHT THAT LOVE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DEMAND. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN A GOOD MOTHER GAVE HER A KIND OF RIGIDITY AND INTOLERANCE. SHE HAD NEVER DECEIVED HER HUSBAND AND HAD BORNE HIM NINE CHILDREN. AFTER HIS DEATH SHE HAD BROUGHT UP HER FAMILY ENERGETICALLY. LEAVING THEIR LITTLE FARM ON THE OUTSKIRTS THEY HAD ENDED UP IN THE OLD POOR PART OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY HAD BEEN LIVING FOR A LONG TIME.

AND CERTAINLY THIS WOMAN WAS NOT LACKING IN QUALITIES. BUT TO HER GRANDSONS WHO WERE AT THE AGE OF ABSOLUTE JUDGMENTS SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A FRAUD. ONE OF THEIR UNCLES HAD TOLD THEM A SIGNIFICANT STORY: HE HAD GONE TO PAY A VISIT TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW AND FROM THE OUTSIDE HAD SEEN HER SITTING IDLY AT THE WINDOW. BUT SHE HAD COME TO THE DOOR WITH A DUSTER IN HER HAND AND HAD APOLOGIZED FOR CARRYING ON WORKING BY SAYING THAT SHE HAD SO LITTLE FREE TIME LEFT AFTER DOING HER HOUSEWORK. AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THIS WAS TYPICAL. SHE FAINTED VERY EASILY AFTER FAMILY DISCUSSIONS. SHE ALSO SUFFERED FROM PAINFUL VOMITING CAUSED BY A LIVER COMPLAINT. BUT SHE SHOWED NOT THE SLIGHTEST DISCRETION IN THE PRACTICE OF HER ILLNESS. FAR FROM SHUTTING HERSELF AWAY SHE WOULD VOMIT NOISILY INTO THE KITCHEN GARBAGE CAN. AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK INTO THE ROOM PALE HER EYES RUNNING WITH TEARS FROM THE EFFORT SHE WOULD REMIND ANYONE WHO BEGGED HER TO GO TO BED THAT SHE HAD TO GET THE NEXT MEAL READY AND CARRY ON IN RUNNING THE HOUSE: “I DO EVERYTHING HERE.” OR AGAIN: “I DON’T KNOW WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU WITHOUT ME.”

THE CHILDREN LEARNED TO IGNORE HER VOMITINGS HER “ATTACKS” AS SHE CALLED THEM AS WELL AS HER COMPLAINTS. ONE DAY SHE WENT TO BED AND DEMANDED THE DOCTOR. THEY SENT FOR HIM TO HUMOR HER. ON THE FIRST DAY HE DIAGNOSED A SLIGHT STOMACH UPSET ON THE SECOND A CANCER OF THE LIVER ON THE THIRD A SERIOUS ATTACK OF JAUNDICE. BUT THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO CHILDREN INSISTED ON SEEING ALL THIS AS YET ANOTHER PERFORMANCE A MORE SOPHISTICATED ACT AND FELT NO CONCERN. THIS WOMAN HAD BULLIED HIM TOO MUCH FOR HIS INITIAL REACTION TO BE PESSIMISTIC. AND THERE IS A KIND OF DESPERATE COURAGE IN BEING LUCID AND REFUSING TO LOVE. BUT PEOPLE WHO PLAY AT BEING ILL CAN SUCCEED: THE GRANDMOTHER CARRIED SIMULATION TO THE POINT OF DEATH. ON HER LAST DAY HER CHILDREN AROUND HER SHE BEGAN FREEING HERSELF OF THE FERMENTATIONS IN HER INTESTINES. SHE TURNED AND SPOKE WITH SIMPLICITY TO HER GRANDSON: “YOU SEE” SHE SAID “I’M FARTING LIKE A LITTLE PIG.” SHE DIED AN HOUR LATER.

AS FOR HER GRANDSON HE NOW REALIZED THAT HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD A THING THAT WAS HAPPENING. HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF OF THE IDEA THAT HE HAD JUST WITNESSED THE LAST AND MOST MONSTROUS OF THIS WOMAN’S PERFORMANCES. AND IF HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HE FELT ANY SORROW HE COULD FIND NONE AT ALL. ONLY ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL OUTBURST OF TEARS DID HE WEEP BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING INSINCERE AND TELLING LIES IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH. IT WAS ON A FINE WINTER’S DAY SHOT THROUGH WITH SUNLIGHT. IN THE PALE BLUE SKY YOU COULD SENSE THE COLD ALL SPANGLED WITH YELLOW. THE CEMETERY OVERLOOKED THE TOWN AND YOU COULD SEE THE FINE TRANSPARENT SUN SETTING IN THE BAY QUIVERING WITH LIGHT LIKE A MOIST LIP.

NONE OF THIS FITS TOGETHER? HOW VERY TRUE! A WOMAN YOU LEAVE BEHIND TO GO TO THE MOVIES AN OLD MAN TO WHOM YOU HAVE STOPPED LISTENING A DEATH THAT REDEEMS NOTHING AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE WHOLE RADIANCE OF THE WORLD. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING? HERE ARE THREE DESTINIES DIFFERENT AND YET ALIKE. DEATH FOR US ALL BUT HIS OWN DEATH TO EACH. AFTER ALL THE SUN STILL WARMS OUR BONES FOR US.

BETWEEN YES AND NO

IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ONLY PARADISES ARE THOSE WE HAVE LOST. I KNOW WHAT NAME TO GIVE THE TENDER AND INHUMAN SOMETHING THAT DWELLS IN ME TODAY. AN EMIGRANT RETURNS TO HIS COUNTRY. AND I REMEMBER. THE IRONY AND TENSION FADE AWAY AND I AM HOME ONCE MORE. I DON’T WANT TO RUMINATE ON HAPPINESS. IT IS MUCH SIMPLER AND MUCH EASIER THAN THAT. FOR WHAT HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED IN THESE HOURS I RETRIEVE FROM THE DEPTHS OF FORGETFULNESS IS THE MEMORY OF A PURE EMOTION A MOMENT SUSPENDED IN ETERNITY. ONLY THIS MEMORY IS TRUE IN ME AND I ALWAYS DISCOVER IT TOO LATE. WE LOVE THE GENTLENESS OF CERTAIN GESTURES THE WAY A TREE FITS INTO A LANDSCAPE. AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE DETAIL WITH WHICH TO RECREATE ALL THIS LOVE BUT IT WILL DO: THE SMELL OF A ROOM TOO LONG SHUT UP THE SPECIAL SOUND OF A FOOTSTEP ON THE ROAD. THIS IS THE WAY IT IS FOR ME. AND IF I LOVED THEN IN GIVING MYSELF I FINALLY BECAME MYSELF SINCE ONLY LOVE RESTORES US.

SLOW PEACEFUL AND GRAVE THESE HOURS RETURN JUST AS STRONG JUST AS MOVING—THERE IS A KIND OF VAGUE DESIRE IN THE DULL SKY. EACH REDISCOVERED GESTURE REVEALS ME TO MYSELF. SOMEONE ONCE SAID TO ME: “IT’S SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE.” AND I REMEMBER THE TONE OF VOICE. ON ANOTHER OCCASION SOMEONE MURMURED: “THE WORST BLUNDER IS STILL TO MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER” WHEN EVERYTHING IS OVER THE THIRST FOR LIFE IS GONE. IS THIS WHAT’S CALLED HAPPINESS? AS WE SKIRT ALONG THESE MEMORIES WE CLOTHE EVERYTHING IN THE SAME QUIET GARB AND DEATH LOOKS LIKE A BACKDROP WHOSE COLORS HAVE FADED. WE TURN BACK INTO OURSELVES. WE FEEL OUR DISTRESS AND LIKE OURSELVES THE BETTER FOR IT. YES PERHAPS THAT’S WHAT HAPPINESS IS THE SELF-PITYING AWARENESS OF OUR UNHAPPINESS.

IT IS CERTAINLY LIKE THAT THIS EVENING. IN THIS MOORISH CAFÉ AT THE FAR END OF THE ARAB TOWN I RECALL NOT A MOMENT OF PAST HAPPINESS BUT A FEELING OF STRANGENESS. IT IS ALREADY NIGHT. ON THE WALLS CANARY-YELLOW LIONS PURSUE GREEN-CLAD SHEIKS AMONG FIVE-BRANCHED PALM TREES. IN A CORNER OF THE CAFÉ AN ACETYLENE LAMP GIVES A FLICKERING LIGHT. THE REAL LIGHT COMES FROM THE FIRE AT THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL STOVE ADORNED WITH YELLOW AND GREEN ENAMEL. THE FLAMES FIGHT UP THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND I CAN FEEL THEM REFLECTED ON MY FACE. I SIT FACING THE DOORWAY AND THE BAY. CROUCHED IN A CORNER THE CAFÉ OWNER SEEMS TO BE LOOKING AT MY GLASS WHICH STANDS THERE EMPTY WITH A MINT LEAF AT THE BOTTOM. THERE IS NO ONE IN THE MAIN ROOM NOISES RISE FROM THE TOWN OPPOSITE WHILE FURTHER OFF IN THE BAY LIGHTS SHINE. I HEAR THE ARAB BREATHE HEAVILY AND HIS EYES GLOW IN THE DUSK. IS THAT THE SOUND OF THE SEA FAR OFF? THE WORLD SIGHS TOWARD ME IN A LONG RHYTHM AND BRINGS ME THE PEACE AND INDIFFERENCE OF IMMORTAL THINGS. TALL RED SHADOWS MAKE THE LIONS ON THE WALLS SWAY WITH A WAVELIKE MOTION. THE AIR GROWS COOL. A FOGHORN SOUNDS AT SEA. THE BEAMS FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE BEGIN TO TURN: ONE GREEN ONE RED AND ONE WHITE. AND STILL THE WORLD SIGHS ITS LONG SIGH. A KIND OF SECRET SONG IS BORN OF THIS INDIFFERENCE. AND I AM HOME AGAIN. I THINK OF A CHILD LIVING IN A POOR DISTRICT. THAT NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HOUSE! THERE WERE ONLY TWO FLOORS AND THE STAIRS WERE UNLIT. EVEN NOW LONG YEARS LATER HE COULD GO BACK THERE ON THE DARKEST NIGHT. HE KNOWS THAT HE COULD CLIMB THE STAIRS WITHOUT STUMBLING ONCE. HIS VERY BODY IS IMPREGNATED WITH THIS HOUSE. HIS LEGS RETAIN THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE STEPS; HIS HAND THE INSTINCTIVE NEVER-CONQUERED HORROR OF THE BANNISTER. BECAUSE OF THE COCKROACHES.

ON SUMMER EVENINGS THE WORKINGMEN SIT ON THEIR BALCONIES. IN HIS APARTMENT THERE WAS ONLY ONE TINY WINDOW. SO THEY WOULD BRING THE CHAIRS DOWN PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND ENJOY THE EVENING AIR. THERE WAS THE STREET THE ICE-CREAM VENDOR NEXT DOOR THE CAFÉS ACROSS THE WAY AND THE NOISE OF CHILDREN RUNNING FROM DOOR TO DOOR. BUT ABOVE ALL THROUGH THE WIDE FIG TREES THERE WAS THE SKY. THERE IS A SOLITUDE IN POVERTY BUT A SOLITUDE THAT GIVES EVERYTHING BACK ITS VALUE. AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WEALTH THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES AND THE STAR-FILLED NIGHT ARE NATURE’S RICHES. BUT SEEN FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LADDER THE SKY RECOVERS ITS FULL MEANING: A PRICELESS GRACE. SUMMER NIGHTS MYSTERIOUS WITH CRACKLING STARS! BEHIND THE CHILD WAS A STINKING CORRIDOR AND HIS LITTLE CHAIR SPLITTING ACROSS THE BOTTOM SANK A LITTLE BENEATH HIS WEIGHT. BUT EYES RAISED HE DRANK IN THE PURE NIGHT. SOMETIMES A LARGE TRAM WOULD RATTLE SWIFTLY PAST. A DRUNK WOULD STAND SINGING AT A STREET CORNER WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SILENCE.

THE CHILD’S MOTHER SAT AS SILENTLY. SOMETIMES PEOPLE WOULD ASK HER: “WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?” AND SHE WOULD ANSWER: “NOTHING.” AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE. EVERYTHING WAS THERE SO SHE THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING. HER LIFE HER INTERESTS HER CHILDREN WERE SIMPLY THERE WITH A PRESENCE TOO NATURAL TO BE FELT. SHE WAS FRAIL HAD DIFFICULTY IN THINKING. SHE HAD A HARSH AND DOMINEERING MOTHER WHO SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO A TOUCHY ANIMAL PRIDE AND HAD LONG HELD SWAY OVER HER WEAK-MINDED DAUGHTER. EMANCIPATED BY HER MARRIAGE THE DAUGHTER CAME HOME OBEDIENTLY WHEN HER HUSBAND DIED. HE DIED A SOLDIER’S DEATH AS THEY SAY. ONE COULD SEE HIS GOLD-FRAMED MILITARY MEDAL AND CROIX DE GUERRE IN A PLACE OF HONOR. THE HOSPITAL SENT THE WIDOW THE SMALL SHELL SPLINTER FOUND IN HIS BODY. SHE KEPT IT. HER GRIEF HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED. SHE HAS FORGOTTEN HER HUSBAND BUT STILL SPEAKS OF HER CHILDREN’S FATHER. TO SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN SHE GOES OUT TO WORK AND GIVES HER WAGES TO HER MOTHER WHO BRINGS THEM UP WITH A WHIP. WHEN SHE HITS THEM TOO HARD THE DAUGHTER TELLS HER: “DON’T HIT THEM ON THE HEAD.” BECAUSE THEY ARE HER CHILDREN SHE IS VERY FOND OF THEM. SHE LOVES THEM WITH A HIDDEN AND IMPARTIAL LOVE. SOMETIMES ON THOSE EVENINGS HE’S REMEMBERING SHE WOULD COME BACK FROM HER EXHAUSTING WORK (AS A CLEANING WOMAN) TO FIND THE HOUSE EMPTY THE OLD WOMAN OUT SHOPPING THE CHILDREN STILL AT SCHOOL. SHE WOULD HUDDLE IN A CHAIR GAZING IN FRONT OF HER WANDERING OFF IN THE DIZZY PURSUIT OF A CRACK ALONG THE FLOOR. AS THE NIGHT THICKENED AROUND HER HER MUTENESS WOULD SEEM IRREDEEMABLY DESOLATE. IF THE CHILD CAME IN HE WOULD SEE HER THIN SHAPE AND BONY SHOULDERS AND STOP AFRAID. HE IS BEGINNING TO FEEL A LOT OF THINGS. HE IS SCARCELY AWARE OF HIS OWN EXISTENCE BUT THIS ANIMAL SILENCE MAKES HIM WANT TO CRY WITH PAIN. HE FEELS SORRY FOR HIS MOTHER; IS THIS THE SAME AS LOVING HER? SHE HAS NEVER HUGGED OR KISSED HIM FOR SHE WOULDN’T KNOW HOW. HE STANDS A LONG TIME WATCHING HER. FEELING SEPARATE FROM HER HE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF HER SUFFERING. SHE DOES NOT HEAR HIM FOR SHE IS DEAF. IN A FEW MOMENTS THE OLD WOMAN WILL COME BACK LIFE WILL START UP AGAIN: THE ROUND LIGHT CAST BY THE KEROSENE LAMP THE OILCLOTH ON THE TABLE THE SHOUTING THE SWEARING. MEANWHILE THE SILENCE MARKS A PAUSE AN IMMENSELY LONG MOMENT. VAGUELY AWARE OF THIS THE CHILD THINKS THE SURGE OF FEELING IN HIM IS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER. AND IT MUST BE BECAUSE AFTER ALL SHE IS HIS MOTHER.

SHE IS THINKING OF NOTHING. OUTSIDE THE LIGHT THE NOISES; HERE SILENCE IN THE NIGHT. THE CHILD WILL GROW WILL LEARN. THEY ARE BRINGING HIM UP AND WILL ASK HIM TO BE GRATEFUL AS IF THEY WERE SPARING HIM PAIN. HIS MOTHER WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE SILENCES. HE WILL SUFFER AS HE GROWS. TO BE A MAN IS WHAT COUNTS. HIS GRANDMOTHER WILL DIE THEN HIS MOTHER THEN HE.

HIS MOTHER HAS GIVEN A SUDDEN START. SOMETHING HAS FRIGHTENED HER. HE LOOKS STUPID STANDING THERE GAZING AT HER. HE OUGHT TO GO AND DO HIS HOMEWORK. THE CHILD HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK. TODAY HE IS IN A SORDID CAFÉ. NOW HE IS A MAN. ISN’T THAT WHAT COUNTS? SURELY NOT SINCE DOING HOMEWORK AND ACCEPTING MANHOOD LEADS TO NOTHING BUT OLD AGE.

STILL CROUCHING IN HIS CORNER THE ARAB SITS WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED ROUND HIS FEET. THE SCENT OF ROASTING COFFEE RISES FROM THE TERRACES AND MINGLES WITH THE EXCITED CHATTER OF YOUNG VOICES. THE HOOTING OF A TUGBOAT ADDS ITS GRAVE AND TENDER NOTE. THE WORLD IS ENDING HERE AS IT DOES EACH DAY AND ALL ITS MEASURELESS TORMENTS NOW GIVE RISE TO NOTHING BUT THIS PROMISE OF PEACE. THE INDIFFERENCE OF THIS STRANGE MOTHER! ONLY THE IMMENSE SOLITUDE OF THE WORLD CAN BE THE MEASURE OF IT. ONE EVENING THEY HAD CALLED HER SON—HE WAS ALREADY QUITE GROWN UP—TO HIS MOTHER’S SIDE. A FRIGHT HAD BROUGHT ON A SERIOUS MENTAL SHOCK. SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF GOING OUT ON THE BALCONY AT THE END OF THE DAY. SHE WOULD TAKE A CHAIR AND LEAN HER MOUTH AGAINST THE COLD AND SALTY IRON OF THE RAILING. THEN SHE WOULD WATCH THE PEOPLE GOING PAST. BEHIND HER THE NIGHT WOULD GRADUALLY THICKEN. IN FRONT OF HER THE SHOPS WOULD SUDDENLY LIGHT UP. THE STREET WOULD FILL WITH PEOPLE AND FIGHTS. SHE WOULD GAZE EMPTILY OUT UNTIL SHE FORGOT WHERE SHE WAS. ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING A MAN HAD LOOMED UP BEHIND HER DRAGGED HER BACKWARD KNOCKED HER ABOUT AND RUN AWAY WHEN HE HEARD A NOISE. SHE HAD SEEN NOTHING AND FAINTED. SHE WAS IN BED WHEN HER SON ARRIVED. HE DECIDED ON THE DOCTOR’S ADVICE TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HER. HE STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED BY HER SIDE LYING ON THE TOP OF THE BLANKETS. IT WAS SUMMER. THE FEAR LEFT BY THE RECENT DRAMA HUNG IN THE AIR OF THE OVERHEATED ROOM. FOOTSTEPS WERE RUSTLING AND DOORS CREAKED. THE SMELL OF THE VINEGAR USED TO COOL HIS MOTHER’S BROW FLOATED IN THE HEAVY AIR. SHE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT WHIMPERING SOMETIMES GIVING A SUDDEN START WHICH WOULD SHAKE HIM FROM HIS BRIEF SNATCHES OF SLEEP. HE WOULD WAKE DRENCHED IN SWEAT READY TO ACT—ONLY TO FALL BACK HEAVILY AFTER GLANCING AT HIS WATCH ON WHICH THE NIGHT LIGHT THREW DANCING SHADOWS. IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT HE REALIZED HOW MUCH THEY HAD BEEN ALONE THAT NIGHT. ALONE AGAINST THE OTHERS. THE “OTHERS” WERE ASLEEP WHILE THEY BOTH BREATHED THE SAME FEVER. EVERYTHING IN THE OLD HOUSE SEEMED EMPTY. WITH THE LAST MIDNIGHT TRAMS ALL HUMAN HOPE SEEMED DRAINED AWAY ALL THE CERTAINTIES OF CITY NOISES GONE. THE HOUSE WAS STILL HUMMING WITH THEIR PASSAGE; THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE EVERYTHING DIED AWAY. ALL THAT REMAINED WAS A GREAT GARDEN OF SILENCE INTERRUPTED NOW AND THEN BY THE SICK WOMAN’S FRIGHTENED MOANS. HE HAD NEVER FELT SO LOST. THE WORLD HAD MELTED AWAY TAKING WITH IT THE ILLUSION THAT LIFE BEGINS AGAIN EACH MORNING. NOTHING WAS LEFT HIS STUDIES AMBITIONS THINGS HE MIGHT CHOOSE IN A RESTAURANT FAVORITE COLORS. NOTHING BUT THE SICKNESS AND DEATH HE FELT SURROUNDED BY … AND YET AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE WORLD WAS CRUMBLING HE WAS ALIVE. FINALLY HE FELL ASLEEP BUT NOT WITHOUT TAKING WITH HIM THE TENDER AND DESPAIRING IMAGE OF TWO PEOPLE’S LONELINESS TOGETHER. LATER MUCH LATER HE WOULD REMEMBER THIS MINGLED SCENT OF SWEAT AND VINEGAR THIS MOMENT WHEN HE HAD FELT THE TIES ATTACHING HIM TO HIS MOTHER. AS IF SHE WERE THE IMMENSE PITY HE FELT SPREAD OUT AROUND HIM MADE FLESH DILIGENTLY WITHOUT PRETENSE PLAYING THE PART OF A POOR OLD WOMAN WHOSE FATE MOVES MEN TO TEARS.

NOW THE ASHES IN THE GRATE ARE BEGINNING TO CHOKE THE FIRE. AND STILL THE SAME SIGH FROM THE EARTH. THE PERFECT SONG OF A DERBOUKA IS HEARD IN THE AIR A WOMAN’S LAUGHTER ABOVE IT. IN THE BAY THE FIGHTS COME CLOSER—FISHING VESSELS NO DOUBT RETURNING TO HARBOR. THE TRIANGLE OF SKY I SEE FROM WHERE I AM SITTING IS STRIPPED OF ITS DAYLIGHT CLOUDS. CHOKED WITH STARS IT QUIVERS ON A PURE BREEZE AND THE PADDED WINGS OF NIGHT BEAT SLOWLY AROUND ME. HOW FAR WILL IT GO THIS NIGHT IN WHICH I CEASE TO BELONG TO MYSELF? THERE IS A DANGEROUS VIRTUE IN THE WORD SIMPLICITY. AND TONIGHT I CAN UNDERSTAND A MAN WANTING TO DIE BECAUSE NOTHING MATTERS ANYMORE WHEN ONE SEES THROUGH LIFE COMPLETELY. A MAN SUFFERS AND ENDURES MISFORTUNE AFTER MISFORTUNE. HE BEARS THEM SETTLES INTO HIS DESTINY. PEOPLE THINK WELL OF HIM. AND THEN ONE EVENING HE MEETS A FRIEND HE HAS BEEN VERY FOND OF WHO SPEAKS TO HIM ABSENT-MINDEDLY. RETURNING HOME THE MAN KILLS HIMSELF. AFTERWARDS THERE IS TALK OF PRIVATE SORROWS AND SECRET DRAMAS. NO IF A REASON REALLY MUST BE FOUND HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE A FRIEND SPOKE TO HIM CARELESSLY. IN THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I’VE GRASPED THE DEEP MEANING OF THE WORLD IT IS ITS SIMPLICITY THAT ALWAYS OVERWHELMS ME. MY MOTHER THAT EVENING AND ITS STRANGE INDIFFERENCE. ON ANOTHER OCCASION I WAS LIVING IN A VILLA IN THE SUBURBS ALONE WITH A DOG A COUPLE OF CATS AND THEIR KITTENS ALL BLACK. THE MOTHER CAT COULD NOT FEED THEM. ONE BY ONE ALL THE KITTENS DIED. THEY FILLED THE ROOM WITH THEIR FILTH. EVERY EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I WOULD FIND ONE LYING STIFF ITS GUMS LAID BARE. ONE EVENING I FOUND THE LAST ONE HALF EATEN BY THE MOTHER. IT STANK ALREADY. THE STENCH OF DEATH MINGLED WITH THE STENCH OF URINE. THEN WITH MY HANDS IN THE FILTH AND THE STENCH OF ROTTING FLESH REEKING IN MY NOSTRILS I SAT DOWN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS MISERY AND GAZED FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR AT THE DEMENTED GLOW IN THE CAT’S GREEN EYES AS IT CROUCHED MOTIONLESS IN THE CORNER. YES. AND IT IS JUST LIKE THAT THIS EVENING. WHEN WE ARE STRIPPED DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT NOTHING LEADS ANYWHERE ANY MORE HOPE AND DESPAIR ARE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS AND THE WHOLE OF LIFE CAN BE SUMMED UP IN AN IMAGE. BUT WHY STOP THERE? SIMPLE EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE THE FIGHTS ALTERNATING IN THE LIGHTHOUSE ONE GREEN ONE RED ONE WHITE; THE COOL OF THE NIGHT; AND THE SMELL OF THE TOWN AND THE POVERTY THAT REACH ME FROM BELOW. IF THIS EVENING THE IMAGE OF A CERTAIN CHILDHOOD COMES BACK TO ME HOW CAN I KEEP FROM WELCOMING THE LESSON OF LOVE AND POVERTY IT OFFERS? SINCE THIS HOUR IS LIKE A PAUSE BETWEEN YES AND NO I LEAVE HOPE OR DISGUST WITH LIFE FOR ANOTHER TIME. YES ONLY TO CAPTURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLICITY OF PARADISES LOST—IN AN IMAGE. AND SO IT WAS NOT LONG AGO IN A HOUSE IN AN OLD PART OF TOWN WHEN A SON WENT TO SEE HIS MOTHER. THEY SAT DOWN FACING EACH OTHER IN SILENCE. BUT THEIR EYES MET:

“WELL MOTHER.”

“WELL HERE WE ARE.”

“ARE YOU BORED? I DON’T TALK MUCH.”

“OH YOU’VE NEVER TALKED MUCH.”

AND THOUGH HER LIPS DO NOT MOVE HER FACE LIGHTS UP IN A BEAUTIFUL SMILE. IT’S TRUE HE NEVER TALKED MUCH TO HER. BUT DID HE EVER NEED TO? WHEN ONE KEEPS QUIET THE SITUATION BECOMES CLEAR. HE IS HER SON SHE IS HIS MOTHER. SHE CAN SAY TO HIM: “YOU KNOW.”

SHE IS SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE DIVAN HER FEET TOGETHER HER HANDS TOGETHER IN HER LAP. HE ON HIS CHAIR SCARCELY LOOKS AT HER AND SMOKES CEASELESSLY. A SILENCE.

“YOU SHOULDN’T SMOKE SO MUCH.”

“I KNOW.”

THE WHOLE FEELING OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RISES THROUGH THE WINDOW: THE ACCORDION FROM THE CAFÉ NEXT DOOR THE TRAFFIC HURRYING IN THE EVENING THE SMELL OF THE SKEWERS OF GRILLED MEAT EATEN BETWEEN SMALL SPRINGY ROLLS OF BREAD A CHILD CRYING IN THE ROAD. THE MOTHER RISES AND PICKS UP HER KNITTING. HER FINGERS ARE CLUMSY TWISTED WITH ARTHRITIS. SHE WORKS SLOWLY TAKING UP THE SAME STITCH THREE OR FOUR TIMES OR UNDOING A WHOLE ROW WITH A DULL RIPPING SOUND.

“IT’S A LITTLE CARDIGAN. I’LL WEAR IT WITH A WHITE COLLAR. WITH THIS AND MY BLACK COAT I’LL BE DRESSED FOR THE SEASON.”

SHE HAS RISEN TO TURN ON THE LIGHT.

“IT GETS DARK EARLY THESE DAYS.”

IT WAS TRUE. SUMMER WAS OVER AND AUTUMN HAD NOT YET BEGUN. SWIFTS WERE STILL CALLING IN THE GENTLE SKY.

“WILL YOU COME BACK SOON?”

“BUT I HAVEN’T LEFT YET. WHY DO YOU MENTION THAT?”

“OH IT WAS JUST TO SAY SOMETHING.”

A TROLLEY GOES BY. A CAR.

“IS IT TRUE I LOOK LIKE MY FATHER?”

“THE SPITTING IMAGE. OF COURSE YOU DIDN’T KNOW HIM. YOU WERE SIX MONTHS OLD WHEN HE DIED. BUT IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MOUSTACHE!”

HE MENTIONED HIS FATHER WITHOUT CONVICTION. NO MEMORY NO EMOTION. PROBABLY HE WAS VERY ORDINARY. BESIDES HE HAD BEEN VERY KEEN TO GO TO WAR. HIS HEAD WAS SPLIT OPEN IN THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE. BLINDED IT TOOK HIM A WEEK TO DIE; HIS NAME IS LISTED ON THE LOCAL WAR MEMORIAL.

“WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT” SHE SAYS “IT WAS BETTER THAT WAY. HE WOULD HAVE COME BACK BLIND OR CRAZY. SO THE POOR MAN …”

“THAT’S RIGHT.”

WHAT IS IT THEN THAT KEEPS HIM IN THIS ROOM EXCEPT THE CERTAINTY THAT IT’S STILL THE BEST THING TO DO THE FEELING THAT THE WHOLE ABSURD SIMPLICITY OF THE WORLD HAS SOUGHT REFUGE HERE.

“WILL YOU BE BACK AGAIN?” SHE SAYS. “I KNOW YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. JUST FROM TIME TO TIME …”

BUT WHERE AM I NOW? AND HOW CAN I SEPARATE THIS DESERTED CAFÉ FROM THAT ROOM IN MY PAST? I DON’T KNOW ANY LONGER WHETHER I’M LIVING OR REMEMBERING. THE BEAMS FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE ARE HERE. AND THE ARAB STANDS IN FRONT OF ME TELLING ME THAT HE IS GOING TO CLOSE. I HAVE TO LEAVE. I NO LONGER WANT TO MAKE SUCH DANGEROUS DESCENTS. IT IS TRUE AS I TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THE BAY AND ITS LIGHT THAT WHAT WELLS UP IN ME IS NOT THE HOPE OF BETTER DAYS BUT A SERENE AND PRIMITIVE INDIFFERENCE TO EVERYTHING AND TO MYSELF. BUT I MUST BREAK THIS TOO LIMP AND EASY CURVE. I NEED MY LUCIDITY. YES EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE. IT’S MEN WHO COMPLICATE THINGS. DON’T LET THEM TELL US ANY STORIES. DON’T LET THEM SAY ABOUT THE MAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH: “HE IS GOING TO PAY HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY” BUT: “THEY’RE GOING TO CHOP HIS HEAD OFF.” IT MAY SEEM LIKE NOTHING. BUT IT DOES MAKE A LITTLE DIFFERENCE. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO PREFER TO LOOK THEIR DESTINY STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

LOVE OF LIFE

AT NIGHT IN PALMA LIFE RECEDES SLOWLY TOWARD THE TUNE-FILLED CAFÉ DISTRICT BEHIND THE MARKET: THE STREETS ARE DARK AND SILENT UNTIL ONE COMES UPON LATTICED DOORWAYS WHERE LIGHT AND MUSIC FILTER THROUGH. I SPENT ALMOST A WHOLE NIGHT IN ONE OF THESE CAFÉS. IT WAS A SMALL VERY LOW ROOM RECTANGULAR PAINTED GREEN AND HUNG WITH PINK GARLANDS. THE WOODEN CEILING WAS COVERED WITH TINY RED LIGHT BULBS. MIRACULOUSLY FITTED INTO THIS MINUTE SPACE WERE AN ORCHESTRA A BAR WITH MULTICOLORED BOTTLES AND CUSTOMERS SQUEEZED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER SO TIGHT THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE. JUST MEN. IN THE MIDDLE TWO SQUARE YARDS OF FREE SPACE. GLASSES AND BOTTLES STREAMED BY AS THE WAITER CARRIED THEM TO ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOM. NO ONE WAS COMPLETELY SOBER. EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING. SOME SORT OF NAVAL OFFICER WAS BELCHING ALCOHOL-LADEN COMPLIMENTS INTO MY FACE. AN AGELESS DWARF AT MY TABLE WAS TELLING ME HIS LIFE STORY. BUT I WAS TOO TENSE TO LISTEN. THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING TUNES ONE COULD ONLY CATCH THE RHYTHM OF SINCE IT WAS BEATEN OUT BY EVERY FOOT IN THE PLACE. SOMETIMES THE DOOR WOULD OPEN. IN THE MIDST OF SHOUTS A NEW ARRIVAL WOULD BE FITTED IN BETWEEN TWO CHAIRS.1

SUDDENLY THE CYMBALS CLASHED AND A WOMAN LEAPED SWIFTLY INTO THE TINY CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CABARET. “TWENTY-ONE” THE OFFICER TOLD ME. I WAS STUPEFIED. THE FACE OF A YOUNG GIRL BUT CARVED IN A MOUNTAIN OF FLESH. SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SIX FEET TALL. WITH ALL HER FAT SHE MUST HAVE WEIGHED THREE HUNDRED POUNDS. HANDS ON HER HIPS WEARING A YELLOW NET THROUGH WHICH A CHECKERBOARD OF WHITE FLESH SWELLED SHE WAS SMILING; AND EACH CORNER OF HER MOUTH SENT A SERIES OF SMALL RIPPLES OF FLESH MOVING TOWARD HER EARS. THE EXCITEMENT IN THE ROOM KNEW NO BOUNDS. ONE FELT THIS GIRL WAS KNOWN LOVED EXPECTED. SHE WAS STILL SMILING. SHE LOOKED AROUND AT THE CUSTOMERS STILL SILENT AND SMILING AND WIGGLED HER BELLY FORWARD. THE CROWD ROARED THEN DEMANDED A SONG THAT EVERYONE SEEMED TO KNOW. IT WAS A NASAL ANDALUSIAN TUNE ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG THREE-BEAT RHYTHM FROM THE DRUMS. SHE SANG AND AT EACH BEAT MIMED THE ACT OF LOVE WITH HER WHOLE BODY. IN THIS MONOTONOUS AND PASSIONATE MOVEMENT REAL WAVES OF FLESH ROSE FROM HER HIPS AND MOVED UPWARD UNTIL THEY DIED AWAY ON HER SHOULDERS. THE ROOM SEEMED STUNNED. BUT PIVOTING AROUND WITH THE REFRAIN SEIZING HER BREASTS WITH BOTH HANDS AND OPENING HER RED MOIST MOUTH THE GIRL TOOK UP THE TUNE IN CHORUS WITH THE AUDIENCE UNTIL EVERYONE STOOD UPRIGHT IN THE TUMULT.

AS SHE STOOD IN THE CENTER FEET APART STICKY WITH SWEAT HAIR HANGING LOOSE SHE LIFTED HER IMMENSE TORSO WHICH BURST FORTH FROM ITS YELLOW NETTING. LIKE AN UNCLEAN GODDESS RISING FROM THE WAVES HER EYES HOLLOW HER FOREHEAD LOW AND STUPID ONLY A SLIGHT QUIVERING AT HER KNEES LIKE A HORSE’S AFTER A RACE SHOWED SHE WAS STILL LIVING. IN THE MIDST OF THE FOOT-STAMPING JOY AROUND HER SHE WAS LIKE AN IGNOBLE AND EXALTING IMAGE OF LIFE WITH DESPAIR IN HER EMPTY EYES AND THICK SWEAT ON HER BELLY …

WITHOUT CAFÉS AND NEWSPAPERS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL. A PAPER PRINTED IN OUR OWN LANGUAGE A PLACE TO RUB SHOULDERS WITH OTHERS IN THE EVENINGS ENABLE US TO IMITATE THE FAMILIAR GESTURES OF THE MAN WE WERE AT HOME WHO SEEN FROM A DISTANCE SEEMS SO MUCH A STRANGER. FOR WHAT GIVES VALUE TO TRAVEL IS FEAR. IT BREAKS DOWN A KIND OF INNER STRUCTURE WE HAVE. ONE CAN NO LONGER CHEAT—HIDE BEHIND THE HOURS SPENT AT THE OFFICE OR AT THE PLANT (THOSE HOURS WE PROTEST SO LOUDLY WHICH PROTECT US SO WELL FROM THE PAIN OF BEING ALONE). I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO WRITE NOVELS IN WHICH MY HEROES WOULD SAY: “WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT THE OFFICE?” OR AGAIN: “MY WIFE HAS DIED BUT FORTUNATELY I HAVE ALL THESE ORDERS TO FILL FOR TOMORROW.” TRAVEL ROBS US OF SUCH REFUGE. FAR FROM OUR OWN PEOPLE OUR OWN LANGUAGE STRIPPED OF ALL OUR PROPS DEPRIVED OF OUR MASKS (ONE DOESN’T KNOW THE FARE ON THE STREETCARS OR ANYTHING ELSE) WE ARE COMPLETELY ON THE SURFACE OF OURSELVES. BUT ALSO SOUL-SICK WE RESTORE TO EVERY BEING AND EVERY OBJECT ITS MIRACULOUS VALUE. A WOMAN DANCING WITHOUT A THOUGHT IN HER HEAD A BOTTLE ON A TABLE GLIMPSED BEHIND A CURTAIN: EACH IMAGE BECOMES A SYMBOL. THE WHOLE OF LIFE SEEMS REFLECTED IN IT INSOFAR AS IT SUMMARIZES OUR OWN LIFE AT THE MOMENT. WHEN WE ARE AWARE OF EVERY GIFT THE CONTRADICTORY INTOXICATIONS WE CAN ENJOY (INCLUDING THAT OF LUCIDITY) ARE INDESCRIBABLE. NEVER PERHAPS HAS ANY LAND BUT THE MEDITERRANEAN CARRIED ME SO FAR FROM MYSELF AND YET SO NEAR.

THE EMOTION I FELT AT THE CAFÉ IN PALMA PROBABLY CAME FROM THIS. ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT STRUCK ME IN THE EMPTY DISTRICT NEAR THE CATHEDRAL AT NOON AMONG THE OLD PALACES WITH THEIR COOL COURTYARDS IN THE STREETS WITH THEIR SCENTED SHADOWS WAS THE IDEA OF A CERTAIN “SLOWNESS.” NO ONE IN THE STREETS. MOTIONLESS OLD WOMEN IN THE MIRADORS. AND WALKING ALONG PAST THE HOUSES STOPPING IN COURTYARDS FULL OF GREEN PLANTS AND ROUND GRAY PILLARS I MELTED INTO THIS SMELL OF SILENCE LOSING MY LIMITS BECOMING NOTHING MORE THAN THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS OR THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS WHOSE SHADOWS I COULD SEE ON THE STILL SUNLIT PORTION OF THE WALLS. I WOULD ALSO SPEND LONG HOURS IN THE LITTLE GOTHIC CLOISTER OF SAN FRANCISCO. ITS DELICATE PRECIOUS COLONNADE SHONE WITH THE FINE GOLDEN YELLOW OF OLD SPANISH MONUMENTS. IN THE COURTYARD THERE WERE ROSE LAURELS FAKE PEPPER PLANTS A WROUGHT-IRON WELL FROM WHICH HUNG A LONG RUSTY METAL SPOON. PASSERS-BY DRANK FROM IT. I STILL REMEMBER SOMETIMES THE CLEAR SOUND IT MADE AS IT DROPPED BACK ON THE STONE OF THE WELL. YET IT WAS NOT THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE THAT THIS CLOISTER TAUGHT ME. IN THE SHARP SOUND OF WINGBEATS AS THE PIGEONS FLEW AWAY THE SUDDEN SNUG SILENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN IN THE LONELY SQUEAKING OF THE CHAIN ON ITS WELL I FOUND A NEW AND YET FAMILIAR FLAVOR. I WAS LUCID AND SMILING BEFORE THIS UNIQUE PLAY OF APPEARANCES. A SINGLE GESTURE I FELT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SHATTER THIS CRYSTAL IN WHICH THE WORLD’S FACE WAS SMILING. SOMETHING WOULD COME UNDONE—THE FLIGHT OF PIGEONS WOULD DIE AND EACH WOULD SLOWLY TUMBLE ON ITS OUTSTRETCHED WINGS. ONLY MY SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY LENT PLAUSIBILITY TO WHAT LOOKED SO LIKE AN ILLUSION. I JOINED IN THE GAME. I ACCEPTED THE APPEARANCES WITHOUT BEING TAKEN IN. A FINE GOLDEN SUN GENTLY WARMED THE YELLOW STONES OF THE CLOISTER. A WOMAN WAS DRAWING WATER FROM THE WELL. IN AN HOUR A MINUTE A SECOND NOW PERHAPS EVERYTHING MIGHT COLLAPSE. AND YET THIS MIRACLE CONTINUED. THE WORLD LIVED ON MODEST IRONIC AND DISCREET (LIKE CERTAIN GENTLE AND RESERVED FORMS OF WOMEN’S FRIENDSHIP). A BALANCE CONTINUED COLORED HOWEVER BY ALL THE APPREHENSION OF ITS OWN END.

THERE LAY ALL MY LOVE OF LIFE: A SILENT PASSION FOR WHAT WOULD PERHAPS ESCAPE ME A BITTERNESS BENEATH A FLAME. EACH DAY I WOULD LEAVE THIS CLOISTER LIKE A MAN LIFTED FROM HIMSELF INSCRIBED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT IN THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WORLD. AND I KNOW WHY I THOUGHT THEN OF THE EXPRESSIONLESS EYES OF DORIC APOLLOS OR THE STIFF MOTIONLESS CHARACTERS IN GIOTTO’S PAINTINGS.2 IT WAS AT THESE MOMENTS THAT I TRULY UNDERSTOOD WHAT COUNTRIES LIKE THIS COULD OFFER ME. I AM SURPRISED MEN CAN AND CERTAINTIES AND RULES FOR LIFE ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THAT THEY CAN SATISFY THEIR REASON THERE AND JUSTIFY OPTIMISM AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. FOR WHAT STRUCK ME THEN WAS NOT A WORLD MADE TO MAN’S MEASURE BUT ONE THAT CLOSED IN UPON HIM. IF THE LANGUAGE OF THESE COUNTRIES HARMONIZED WITH WHAT ECHOED DEEPLY WITHIN ME IT WAS NOT BECAUSE IT ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BUT BECAUSE IT MADE THEM SUPERFLUOUS. INSTEAD OF PRAYERS OF THANKSGIVING RISING TO MY LIPS IT WAS THIS NADA WHOSE BIRTH IS POSSIBLE ONLY AT THE SIGHT OF LANDSCAPES CRUSHED BY THE SUN. THERE IS NO LOVE OF LIFE WITHOUT DESPAIR OF LIFE.

IN IBIZA I SAT EVERY DAY IN THE CAFÉS THAT DOT THE HARBOR. TOWARD FIVE IN THE EVENING THE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD STROLL BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE FULL LENGTH OF THE JETTY; THIS IS WHERE MARRIAGES AND THE WHOLE OF LIFE ARE ARRANGED. ONE CANNOT HELP THINKING THERE IS A CERTAIN GRANDEUR IN BEGINNING ONE’S LIFE THIS WAY WITH THE WHOLE WORLD LOOKING ON. I WOULD SIT DOWN STILL DIZZY FROM THE DAY’S SUN MY HEAD FULL OF WHITE CHURCHES AND CHALKY WALLS DRY FIELDS AND SHAGGY OLIVE TREES. I WOULD DRINK A SWEETISH SYRUP GAZING AT THE CURVE OF THE HILLS IN FRONT OF ME. THEY SLOPED GENTLY DOWN TO THE SEA. THE EVENING WOULD GROW GREEN. ON THE LARGEST OF THE HILLS THE LAST BREEZE TURNED THE SAILS OF A WINDMILL. AND BY A NATURAL MIRACLE EVERYONE LOWERED HIS VOICE. SOON THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE SKY AND MUSICAL WORDS RISING TOWARD IT AS IF HEARD FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. THERE WAS SOMETHING FLEETING AND MELANCHOLY IN THE BRIEF MOMENT OF DUSK PERCEPTIBLE NOT ONLY TO ONE MAN BUT ALSO TO A WHOLE PEOPLE. AS FOR ME I LONGED TO LOVE AS PEOPLE LONG TO CRY. I FELT THAT EVERY HOUR I SLEPT NOW WOULD BE AN HOUR STOLEN FROM LIFE … THAT IS TO SAY FROM THOSE HOURS OF UNDEFINED DESIRE. I WAS TENSE AND MOTIONLESS AS I HAD BEEN DURING THOSE VIBRANT HOURS AT THE CABARET IN PALMA AND AT THE CLOISTER IN SAN FRANCISCO POWERLESS AGAINST THIS IMMENSE DESIRE TO HOLD THE WORLD BETWEEN MY HANDS.

I KNOW THAT I AM WRONG THAT WE CANNOT GIVE OURSELVES COMPLETELY. OTHERWISE WE COULD NOT CREATE. BUT THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO LOVING AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME IF I HOLD THINGS BADLY IF I CAN EMBRACE EVERYTHING? THERE ARE WOMEN IN GENOA WHOSE SMILE I LOVED FOR A WHOLE MORNING. I SHALL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN AND CERTAINLY NOTHING IS SIMPLER. BUT WORDS WILL NEVER SMOTHER THE FLAME OF MY REGRET. I WATCHED THE PIGEONS FLYING PAST THE LITTLE WELL AT THE CLOISTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND FORGOT MY THIRST. BUT A MOMENT ALWAYS CAME WHEN I WAS THIRSTY AGAIN.

THE WRONG SIDE AND THE RIGHT SIDE

SHE WAS A LONELY AND PECULIAR WOMAN. SHE KEPT IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE SPIRITS TOOK UP THEIR CAUSES AND REFUSED TO SEE CERTAIN MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY WHO HAD A BAD REPUTATION IN THIS WORLD WHERE SHE FOUND REFUGE.

ONE DAY SHE RECEIVED A SMALL LEGACY FROM HER SISTER. THESE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS COMING AT THE END OF HER LIFE TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING OF AN ENCUMBRANCE. THEY HAD TO BE INVESTED. IF ALMOST EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF USING A LARGE FORTUNE THE DIFFICULTY BEGINS WHEN THE SUM IS A SMALL ONE. THE WOMAN REMAINED TRUE TO HERSELF. NEARING DEATH SHE WANTED SHELTER FOR HER OLD BONES. A REAL OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED. A LEASE HAD JUST EXPIRED IN THE LOCAL CEMETERY. ON THIS PLOT THE OWNERS HAD ERECTED A MAGNIFICENT SOBERLY DESIGNED BLACK MARBLE TOMB A GENUINE TREASURE IN FACT WHICH THEY WERE PREPARED TO LET HER HAVE FOR FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS. SHE PURCHASED THE VAULT. IT WAS A SAFE INVESTMENT IMMUNE TO POLITICAL UPHEAVALS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK MARKET. SHE HAD THE INNER GRAVE PREPARED AND KEPT IT IN READINESS TO RECEIVE HER BODY. AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED SHE HAD HER NAME CARVED ON IT IN GOLD LETTERS.

THE TRANSACTION SATISFIED HER SO COMPLETELY THAT SHE WAS SEIZED WITH A VERITABLE LOVE FOR HER TOMB. AT FIRST SHE WENT TO SEE HOW THE WORK WAS PROGRESSING. SHE ENDED UP BY PAYING HERSELF A VISIT EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. IT WAS THE ONLY TIME SHE WENT OUT AND IT WAS HER ONLY AMUSEMENT. TOWARD TWO IN THE AFTERNOON SHE MADE THE LONG TRIP THAT BROUGHT HER TO THE CITY GATES WHERE THE CEMETERY WAS. SHE WOULD GO INTO THE LITTLE TOMB CAREFULLY CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND KNEEL ON THE PRIE-DIEU. IT WAS THUS QUITE ALONE WITH HERSELF CONFRONTING WHAT SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WOULD BECOME REDISCOVERING THE LINK IN A CHAIN STILL BROKEN THAT SHE EFFORTLESSLY PIERCED THE SECRET DESIGNS OF PROVIDENCE. A STRANGE SYMBOL EVEN MADE HER REALIZE ONE DAY THAT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD SHE WAS DEAD. ON ALL SAINTS’ DAY ARRIVING LATER THAN USUAL SHE FOUND THE DOORSTEP OF HER TOMB PIOUSLY STREWN WITH VIOLETS. SOME UNKNOWN AND TENDERHEARTED PASSERS-BY SEEING THE TOMB DEVOID OF FLOWERS HAD HAD THE KIND THOUGHT OF SHARING THEIR OWN AND HONORED HER NEGLECTED MEMORY.

AND NOW I THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AGAIN. I CAN SEE ONLY THE WALLS OF THE GARDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY WINDOW. AND A FEW BRANCHES FLOWING WITH LIGHT. HIGHER STILL MORE FOLIAGE AND HIGHER STILL THE SUN. BUT ALL I CAN PERCEIVE OF THE AIR REJOICING OUTSIDE OF ALL THE JOY SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD ARE THE SHADOWS OF BRANCHES PLAYING ON MY WHITE CURTAINS. ALSO FIVE RAYS OF SUNLIGHT PATIENTLY POURING THE SCENT OF DRIED GRASS INTO THE ROOM. A BREEZE AND THE SHADOWS ON THE CURTAINS COME TO LIFE. IF A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN THE BRIGHT YELLOW OF A VASE OF MIMOSAS LEAPS FROM THE SHADOW. THIS IS ENOUGH: WHEN A SINGLE GLEAM BEGINS I’M FILLED WITH A CONFUSED AND WHIRLING JOY. IT IS A JANUARY AFTERNOON THAT PUTS ME THIS WAY FACE TO FACE WITH THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WORLD. BUT THE COLD REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR. COVERING EVERYTHING A FILM OF SUNLIGHT THAT WOULD CRACK BENEATH YOUR FINGER BUT WHICH CLOTHES EVERYTHING IN AN ETERNAL SMILE. WHO AM I AND WHAT CAN I DO BUT ENTER INTO THIS PLAY OF FOLIAGE AND LIGHT? BE THIS RAY OF SUNLIGHT IN WHICH MY CIGARETTE BURNS AWAY THIS SOFTNESS AND DISCREET PASSION BREATHING IN THE AIR. IF I TRY TO REACH MYSELF IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LIGHT. AND IF I TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND SAVOR THIS DELICATE TASTE WHICH REVEALS THE SECRET OF THE WORLD IT IS MYSELF THAT I FIND AT THE DEPTH OF THE UNIVERSE. MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY THIS EXTREME EMOTION WHICH FREES ME FROM MY SURROUNDINGS.

IN A MOMENT—OTHER THINGS OTHER MEN AND THE GRAVES THEY PURCHASE. BUT LET ME CUT THIS MINUTE FROM THE CLOTH OF TIME. OTHERS LEAVE A FLOWER BETWEEN PAGES ENCLOSING IN THEM A WALK WHERE LOVE HAS TOUCHED THEM WITH ITS WING. I WALK TOO BUT AM CARESSED BY A GOD. LIFE IS SHORT AND IT IS SINFUL TO WASTE ONE’S TIME. THEY SAY I’M ACTIVE. BUT BEING ACTIVE IS STILL WASTING ONE’S TIME IF IN DOING ONE LOSES ONESELF. TODAY IS A RESTING TIME AND MY HEART GOES OFF IN SEARCH OF ITSELF. IF AN ANGUISH STILL CLUTCHES ME IT’S WHEN I FEEL THIS IMPALPABLE MOMENT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS LIKE QUICKSILVER. LET THOSE WHO WISH TO TURN THEIR BACKS UPON THE WORLD. I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SINCE I CAN SEE MYSELF BEING BORN. AT THE MOMENT MY WHOLE KINGDOM IS OF THIS WORLD. THIS SUN AND THESE SHADOWS THIS WARMTH AND THIS COLD RISING FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE AIR: WHY WONDER IF SOMETHING IS DYING OR IF MEN SUFFER SINCE EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN ON THIS WINDOW WHERE THE SUN SHEDS ITS PLENTY AS A GREETING TO MY PITY? I CAN SAY AND IN A MOMENT I SHALL SAY THAT WHAT COUNTS IS TO BE HUMAN AND SIMPLE. NO WHAT COUNTS IS TO BE TRUE AND THEN EVERYTHING FITS IN HUMANITY AND SIMPLICITY. WHEN AM I TRUER THAN WHEN I AM THE WORLD? MY CUP BRIMS OVER BEFORE I HAVE TIME TO DESIRE. ETERNITY IS THERE AND I WAS HOPING FOR IT. WHAT I WISH FOR NOW IS NO LONGER HAPPINESS BUT SIMPLY AWARENESS.

ONE MAN CONTEMPLATES AND ANOTHER DIGS HIS GRAVE: HOW CAN WE SEPARATE THEM? MEN AND THEIR ABSURDITY? BUT HERE IS THE SMILE OF THE HEAVENS. THE LIGHT SWELLS AND SOON IT WILL BE SUMMER. BUT HERE ARE THE EYES AND VOICES OF THOSE I MUST LOVE. I HOLD ONTO THE WORLD WITH EVERY GESTURE TO MEN WITH ALL MY GRATITUDE AND PITY. I DO NOT WANT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND WRONG SIDES OF THE WORLD AND I DO NOT LIKE A CHOICE TO BE MADE. PEOPLE DON’T WANT ONE TO BE LUCID AND IRONIC. THEY SAY: “IT SHOWS YOU’RE NOT NICE.” I CAN’T SEE HOW THIS FOLLOWS. CERTAINLY IF I HEAR SOMEONE CALLED AN IMMORALIST MY TRANSLATION IS THAT HE NEEDS TO GIVE HIMSELF AN ETHIC; IF I HEAR OF ANOTHER THAT HE DESPISES INTELLIGENCE I REALIZE THAT HE CANNOT BEAR HIS DOUBTS. BUT THIS IS BECAUSE I DON’T LIKE PEOPLE TO CHEAT. THE GREAT COURAGE IS STILL TO GAZE AS SQUARELY AT THE LIGHT AS AT DEATH. BESIDES HOW CAN I DEFINE THE LINK THAT LEADS FROM THIS ALL-CONSUMING LOVE OF LIFE TO THIS SECRET DESPAIR? IF I LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF IRONY3 CROUCHING UNDERNEATH THINGS SLOWLY IT REVEALS ITSELF. WINKING ITS SMALL CLEAR EYE IT SAYS: “LIVE AS IF …” IN SPITE OF MUCH SEARCHING THIS IS ALL I KNOW.

AFTER ALL I AM NOT SURE THAT I AM RIGHT. BUT IF I THINK OF THAT WOMAN WHOSE STORY I HEARD THIS IS NOT WHAT IS IMPORTANT. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE AND HER DAUGHTER DRESSED HER FOR THE TOMB WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE. ACTUALLY IT SEEMS IT’S EASIER TO DO SO BEFORE THE LIMBS ARE STIFF. YET IT’S ODD ALL THE SAME TO LIVE AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUCH A HURRY.

NUPTIALS OF TIPASA

IN THE SPRING TIPASA IS INHABITED BY GODS AND THE GODS SPEAK IN THE SUN AND THE SCENT OF ABSINTHE LEAVES IN THE SILVER ARMOR OF THE SEA IN THE RAW BLUE SKY THE FLOWER-COVERED RUINS AND THE GREAT BUBBLES OF LIGHT AMONG THE HEAPS OF STONE. AT CERTAIN HOURS OF THE DAY THE COUNTRYSIDE IS BLACK WITH SUNLIGHT. THE EYES TRY IN VAIN TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING BUT DROPS OF LIGHT AND COLORS TREMBLING ON THE LASHES. THE THICK SCENT OF AROMATIC PLANTS TEARS AT THE THROAT AND SUFFOCATES IN THE VAST HEAT. FAR AWAY I CAN JUST MAKE OUT THE BLACK BULK OF THE CHENOUA ROOTED IN THE HILLS AROUND THE VILLAGE MOVING WITH A SLOW AND HEAVY RHYTHM UNTIL FINALLY IT CROUCHES IN THE SEA.

THE VILLAGE WE PASS THROUGH TO GET THERE ALREADY OPENS ON THE BAY. WE ENTER A BLUE AND YELLOW WORLD AND ARE WELCOMED BY THE PUNGENT ODOROUS SIGH OF THE ALGERIAN SUMMER EARTH. EVERYWHERE PINKISH BOUGAINVILLAEA HANGS OVER VILLA WALLS; IN THE GARDENS THE HIBISCUS ARE STILL PALE RED AND THERE IS A PROFUSION OF TEA ROSES THICK AS CREAM WITH DELICATE BORDERS OF LONG BLUE IRIS. ALL THE STONES ARE WARM. AS WE STEP OFF THE BUTTERCUP YELLOW BUS BUTCHERS IN THEIR LITTLE RED TRUCKS ARE MAKING THEIR MORNING ROUNDS CALLING TO THE VILLAGERS WITH THEIR HORNS.

TO THE LEFT OF THE PORT A DRY STONE STAIRWAY LEADS TO THE RUINS THROUGH THE MASTIC TREES AND BROOM. THE PATH GOES BY A SMALL LIGHTHOUSE BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY. ALREADY AT THE FOOT OF THIS LIGHTHOUSE LARGE RED YELLOW AND VIOLET PLANTS DESCEND TOWARD THE FIRST ROCKS SUCKED AT BY THE SEA WITH A KISSING SOUND. AS WE STAND IN THE SLIGHT BREEZE WITH THE SUN WARMING ONE SIDE OF OUR FACES WE WATCH THE FIGHT COMING DOWN FROM THE SKY THE SMOOTH SEA AND THE SMILE OF ITS GLITTERING TEETH. WE ARE SPECTATORS FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE WE ENTER THE KINGDOM OF RUINS.

AFTER A FEW STEPS THE SMELL OF ABSINTHE SEIZES ONE BY THE THROAT. THE WORMWOOD’S GRAY WOOL COVERS THE RUINS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. ITS OIL FERMENTS IN THE HEAT AND THE WHOLE EARTH GIVES OFF A HEADY ALCOHOL THAT MAKES THE SKY FLICKER. WE WALK TOWARD AN ENCOUNTER WITH LOVE AND DESIRE. WE ARE NOT SEEKING LESSONS OR THE BITTER PHILOSOPHY ONE REQUIRES OF GREATNESS. EVERYTHING SEEMS FUTILE HERE EXCEPT THE SUN OUR KISSES AND THE WILD SCENTS OF THE EARTH. I DO NOT SEEK SOLITUDE. I HAVE OFTEN BEEN HERE WITH THOSE I LOVED AND READ ON THEIR FEATURES THE CLEAR SMILE THE FACE OF LOVE ASSUMES. HERE I LEAVE ORDER AND MODERATION TO OTHERS. THE GREAT FREE LOVE OF NATURE AND THE SEA ABSORBS ME COMPLETELY. IN THIS MARRIAGE OF RUINS AND SPRINGTIME THE RUINS HAVE BECOME STONES AGAIN AND LOSING THE POLISH IMPOSED ON THEM BY MEN THEY HAVE REVERTED TO NATURE. TO CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF HER PRODIGAL DAUGHTERS NATURE HAS LAID OUT A PROFUSION OF FLOWERS. THE HELIOTROPE PUSHES ITS RED AND WHITE HEAD BETWEEN THE FLAGSTONES OF THE FORUM RED GERANIUMS SPILL THEIR BLOOD OVER WHAT WERE HOUSES TEMPLES AND PUBLIC SQUARES. LIKE THE MEN WHOM MUCH KNOWLEDGE BRINGS BACK TO GOD MANY YEARS HAVE BROUGHT THESE RUINS BACK TO THEIR MOTHER’S HOUSE. TODAY THEIR PAST HAS FINALLY LEFT THEM AND NOTHING DISTRACTS THEM FROM THE DEEP FORCE PULLING THEM BACK TO THE CENTER OF ALL THAT FALLS.

HOW MANY HOURS HAVE I SPENT CRUSHING ABSINTHE LEAVES CARESSING RUINS TRYING TO MATCH MY BREATHING WITH THE WORLD’S TUMULTUOUS SIGHS! DEEP AMONG WILD SCENTS AND CONCERTS OF SOMNOLENT INSECTS I OPEN MY EYES AND HEART TO THE UNBEARABLE GRANDEUR OF THIS HEAT-SOAKED SKY. IT IS NOT SO EASY TO BECOME WHAT ONE IS TO REDISCOVER ONE’S DEEPEST MEASURE. BUT WATCHING THE SOLID BACKBONE OF THE CHENOUA MY HEART WOULD GROW CALM WITH A STRANGE CERTAINTY. I WAS LEARNING TO BREATHE I WAS FITTING INTO THINGS AND FULFILLING MYSELF. AS I CLIMBED ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THE HILLS EACH BROUGHT A REWARD LIKE THE TEMPLE WHOSE COLUMNS MEASURE THE COURSE OF THE SUN AND FROM WHICH ONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE VILLAGE ITS WHITE AND PINK WALLS AND GREEN VERANDAS. LIKE THE BASILICA ON THE EAST HILL TOO WHICH STILL HAS ITS WALLS AND IS SURROUNDED BY A GREAT CIRCLE OF UNCOVERED ORNAMENTED COFFINS MOST OF THEM SCARCELY OUT OF THE EARTH WHOSE NATURE THEY STILL SHARE. THEY USED TO CONTAIN CORPSES; NOW SAGE AND WALLFLOWERS GROW IN THEM. THE SAINTE-SALSA BASILICA IS CHRISTIAN BUT EACH TIME WE LOOK OUT THROUGH A GAP IN THE WALLS WE ARE GREETED BY THE SONG OF THE WORLD: HILLSIDES PLANTED WITH PINE AND CYPRESS TREES OR THE SEA ROLLING ITS WHITE HORSES TWENTY YARDS AWAY. THE HILL ON WHICH SAINTE-SALSA IS BUILT HAS A FLAT TOP AND THE WIND BLOWS MORE STRONGLY THROUGH THE PORTALS. UNDER THE MORNING SUN A GREAT HAPPINESS HOVERS IN SPACE.

THOSE WHO NEED MYTHS ARE INDEED POOR. HERE THE GODS SERVE AS BEDS OR RESTING PLACES AS THE DAY RACES ACROSS THE SKY. I DESCRIBE AND SAY: “THIS IS RED THIS BLUE THIS GREEN. THIS IS THE SEA THE MOUNTAIN THE FLOWERS.” NEED I MENTION DIONYSUS TO SAY THAT I LOVE TO CRUSH MASTIC BULBS UNDER MY NOSE? IS THE OLD HYMN THAT WILL LATER COME TO ME QUITE SPONTANEOUSLY EVEN ADDRESSED TO DEMETER: “HAPPY IS HE ALIVE WHO HAS SEEN THESE THINGS ON EARTH”? HOW CAN WE FORGET THE LESSON OF SIGHT AND SEEING ON THIS EARTH? ALL MEN HAD TO DO AT THE MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS WAS WATCH. YET EVEN HERE I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE WORLD. I MUST BE NAKED AND DIVE INTO THE SEA STILL SCENTED WITH THE PERFUMES OF THE EARTH WASH THEM OFF IN THE SEA AND CONSUMMATE WITH MY FLESH THE EMBRACE FOR WHICH SUN AND SEA LIPS TO LIPS HAVE SO LONG BEEN SIGHING. I FEEL THE SHOCK OF THE WATER RISE UP THROUGH A THICK COLD GLUE THEN DIVE BACK WITH MY EARS RINGING MY NOSE STREAMING AND THE TASTE OF SALT IN MY MOUTH. AS I SWIM MY ARMS SHINING WITH WATER FLASH INTO GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT UNTIL I FOLD THEM IN AGAIN WITH A TWIST OF ALL MY MUSCLES; THE WATER STREAMS ALONG MY BODY AS MY LEGS TAKE TUMULTUOUS POSSESSION OF THE WAVES—AND THE HORIZON DISAPPEARS. ON THE BEACH I FLOP DOWN ON THE SAND YIELD TO THE WORLD FEEL THE WEIGHT OF FLESH AND BONES AGAIN DAZED WITH SUNLIGHT OCCASIONALLY GLANCING AT MY ARMS WHERE THE WATER SLIDES OFF AND PATCHES OF SALT AND SOFT BLOND HAIR APPEAR ON MY SKIN.

HERE I UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY GLORY: THE RIGHT TO LOVE WITHOUT LIMITS. THERE IS ONLY ONE LOVE IN THIS WORLD. TO CLASP A WOMAN’S BODY IS ALSO TO HOLD IN ONE’S ARMS THIS STRANGE JOY THAT DESCENDS FROM SKY TO SEA. IN A MOMENT WHEN I THROW MYSELF DOWN AMONG THE ABSINTHE PLANTS TO BRING THEIR SCENT INTO MY BODY. I SHALL KNOW APPEARANCES TO THE CONTRARY THAT I AM FULFILLING A TRUTH WHICH IS THE SUN’S AND WHICH WILL ALSO BE MY DEATH’S. IN A SENSE IT IS INDEED MY LIFE THAT I AM STAKING HERE A LIFE THAT TASTES OF WARM STONE THAT IS FULL OF THE SIGHS OF THE SEA AND THE RISING SONG OF THE CRICKETS. THE BREEZE IS COOL AND THE SKY BLUE. I LOVE THIS LIFE WITH ABANDON AND WISH TO SPEAK OF IT BOLDLY: IT MAKES ME PROUD OF MY HUMAN CONDITION. YET PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN TOLD ME: THERE’S NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF. YES THERE IS: THIS SUN THIS SEA MY HEART LEAPING WITH YOUTH THE SALT TASTE OF MY BODY AND THIS VAST LANDSCAPE IN WHICH TENDERNESS AND GLORY MERGE IN BLUE AND YELLOW. IT IS TO CONQUER THIS THAT I NEED MY STRENGTH AND MY RESOURCES. EVERYTHING HERE LEAVES ME INTACT I SURRENDER NOTHING OF MYSELF AND DON NO MASK: LEARNING PATIENTLY AND ARDUOUSLY HOW TO LIVE IS ENOUGH FOR ME WELL WORTH ALL THEIR ARTS OF LIVING.

SHORTLY BEFORE NOON WE WOULD COME BACK THROUGH THE RUINS TO A LITTLE CAFÉ BY THE SIDE OF THE PORT. HOW COOL WAS THE WELCOME OF A TALL GLASS OF ICED GREEN MINT IN THE SHADY ROOM TO HEADS RINGING WITH COLORS AND THE CYMBALS OF THE SUN! OUTSIDE WERE THE SEA AND THE ROAD BURNING WITH DUST. SEATED AT THE TABLE I WOULD TRY TO BLINK MY EYELIDS SO AS TO CATCH THE MULTICOLORED DAZZLE OF THE WHITE-HOT SKY. OUR FACES DAMP WITH SWEAT BUT OUR BODIES COOL IN LIGHT CLOTHING WE WOULD FLAUNT THE HAPPY WEARINESS OF A DAY OF NUPTIALS WITH THE WORLD.

THE FOOD IS BAD IN THIS CAFÉ BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF FRUIT ESPECIALLY PEACHES WHOSE JUICE DRIPS DOWN YOUR CHIN AS YOU BITE INTO THEM. GAZING AVIDLY BEFORE ME MY TEETH CLOSING ON A PEACH I CAN HEAR THE BLOOD POUNDING IN MY EARS. THE VAST SILENCE OF NOON HANGS OVER THE SEA. EVERY BEAUTIFUL THING HAS A NATURAL PRIDE IN ITS OWN BEAUTY AND TODAY THE WORLD IS ALLOWING ITS PRIDE TO SEEP FROM EVERY PORE. WHY IN ITS PRESENCE SHOULD I DENY THE JOY OF LIVING AS LONG AS I KNOW EVERYTHING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS JOY? THERE IS NO SHAME IN BEING HAPPY. BUT TODAY THE FOOL IS KING AND I CALL THOSE WHO FEAR PLEASURE FOOLS. THEY’VE TOLD US SO MUCH ABOUT PRIDE: YOU KNOW LUCIFER’S SIN. BEWARE THEY USED TO CRY YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SOUL AND YOUR VITAL POWERS. I HAVE IN FACT LEARNED SINCE THAT A CERTAIN PRIDE … BUT AT OTHER TIMES I CANNOT PREVENT MYSELF FROM ASSERTING THE PRIDE IN LIVING THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CONSPIRES TO GIVE ME. AT TIPASA “I SEE” EQUALS “I BELIEVE” AND I AM NOT STUBBORN ENOUGH TO DENY WHAT MY HANDS CAN TOUCH AND MY LIPS CARESS. I DON’T FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE IT INTO A WORK OF ART BUT TO DESCRIBE IT WHICH IS DIFFERENT. TIPASA SEEMS TO ME LIKE A CHARACTER ONE DESCRIBES IN ORDER TO GIVE INDIRECT EXPRESSION TO A CERTAIN VIEW OF THE WORLD. LIKE SUCH CHARACTERS TIPASA TESTIFIES TO SOMETHING AND DOES IT LIKE A MAN. TIPASA IS THE PERSONAGE I’M DESCRIBING TODAY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VERY ACT OF CARESSING AND DESCRIBING MY DELIGHT WILL INSURE THAT IT HAS NO END. THERE IS A TIME FOR LIVING AND A TIME FOR GIVING EXPRESSION TO LIFE. THERE IS ALSO A TIME FOR CREATING WHICH IS LESS NATURAL. FOR ME IT IS ENOUGH TO LIVE WITH MY WHOLE BODY AND BEAR WITNESS WITH MY WHOLE HEART. LIVE TIPASA MANIFEST ITS LESSONS AND THE WORK OF ART WILL COME LATER. HEREIN LIES A FREEDOM.

I NEVER SPENT MORE THAN A DAY AT TIPASA. A MOMENT ALWAYS COMES WHEN ONE HAS LOOKED TOO LONG AT A LANDSCAPE JUST AS IT IS A LONG TIME BEFORE ONE SEES ENOUGH OF IT. MOUNTAINS THE SKY THE SEA ARE LIKE FACES WHOSE BARRENNESS OR SPLENDOR WE DISCOVER BY LOOKING RATHER THAN SEEING. BUT IN ORDER TO BE ELOQUENT EVERY FACE MUST BE SEEN ANEW. ONE COMPLAINS OF GROWING TIRED TOO QUICKLY WHEN ONE OUGHT TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE WORLD SEEMS NEW ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FORGOTTEN IT.

TOWARD EVENING I WOULD RETURN TO A MORE FORMAL SECTION OF THE PARK SET OUT AS A GARDEN JUST OFF THE MAIN ROAD. LEAVING THE TUMULT OF SCENTS AND SUNLIGHT IN THE COOL EVENING AIR THE MIND WOULD GROW CALM AND THE BODY RELAXED SAVORING THE INNER SILENCE BORN OF SATISFIED LOVE. I WOULD SIT ON A BENCH WATCHING THE COUNTRYSIDE EXPAND WITH LIGHT. I WAS FULL. ABOVE ME DROOPED A POMEGRANATE TREE ITS FLOWER BUDS CLOSED AND RIBBED LIKE SMALL TIGHT FISTS CONTAINING EVERY HOPE OF SPRING. THERE WAS ROSEMARY BEHIND ME AND I COULD SMELL ONLY THE SCENT OF ITS ALCOHOL. THE HILLS WERE FRAMED WITH TREES AND BEYOND THEM STRETCHED A BAND OF SEA ON WHICH THE SKY LIKE A SAIL BECALMED RESTED IN ALL ITS TENDERNESS. I FELT A STRANGE JOY IN MY HEART THE SPECIAL JOY THAT STEMS FROM A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. THERE IS A FEELING ACTORS HAVE WHEN THEY KNOW THEY’VE PLAYED THEIR PART WELL THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THEY HAVE MADE THEIR OWN GESTURES COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF THE IDEAL CHARACTER THEY EMBODY HAVING ENTERED SOMEHOW INTO A PREARRANGED DESIGN BRINGING IT TO LIFE WITH THEIR OWN HEARTBEATS. THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I FELT: I HAD PLAYED MY PART WELL. I HAD PERFORMED MY TASK AS A MAN AND THE FACT THAT I HAD KNOWN JOY FOR ONE ENTIRE DAY SEEMED TO ME NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS BUT THE INTENSE FULFILLMENT OF A CONDITION WHICH IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MAKES IT OUR DUTY TO BE HAPPY. THEN WE ARE ALONE AGAIN BUT SATISFIED.

NOW THE TREES WERE FILLED WITH BIRDS. THE EARTH WOULD GIVE A LONG SIGH BEFORE SLIDING INTO DARKNESS. IN A MOMENT WITH THE FIRST STAR NIGHT WOULD FALL ON THE THEATER OF THE WORLD. THE DAZZLING GODS OF DAY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR DAILY DEATH. BUT OTHER GODS WOULD COME. AND THOUGH THEY WOULD BE DARKER THEIR RAVAGED FACES TOO WOULD COME FROM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.

FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST THE WAVES’ ENDLESS CRASHING AGAINST THE SHORE CAME TOWARD ME THROUGH A SPACE DANCING WITH GOLDEN POLLEN. SEA LANDSCAPE SILENCE SCENTS OF THIS EARTH I WOULD DRINK MY FILL OF A SCENT-LADEN LIFE SINKING MY TEETH INTO THE WORLD’S FRUIT GOLDEN ALREADY OVERWHELMED BY THE FEELING OF ITS STRONG SWEET JUICE FLOWING ON MY LIPS. NO IT WAS NEITHER I NOR THE WORLD THAT COUNTED BUT SOLELY THE HARMONY AND SILENCE THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE LOVE BETWEEN US. A LOVE I WAS NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH TO CLAIM FOR MYSELF ALONE PROUDLY AWARE THAT I SHARED IT WITH A WHOLE RACE BORN IN THE SUN AND SEA ALIVE AND SPIRITED DRAWING GREATNESS FROM ITS SIMPLICITY AND UPRIGHT ON THE BEACHES SMILING IN COMPLICITY AT THE BRILLIANCE OF ITS SKIES.

SUMMER IN ALGIERS

THEY ARE OFTEN SECRET THE LOVE AFFAIRS WE HAVE WITH CITIES. OLD TOWNS LIKE PARIS PRAGUE AND EVEN FLORENCE ARE CLOSED IN UPON THEMSELVES IN SUCH A WAY AS TO DELIMIT THEIR DOMAIN. BUT ALGIERS AND A FEW OTHER PRIVILEGED COASTAL TOWNS OPEN INTO THE SKY LIKE A MOUTH OR A WOUND. WHAT ONE CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH IN ALGIERS IS WHAT EVERYBODY LIVES WITH: THE SEA VISIBLE FROM EVERY CORNER A CERTAIN HEAVINESS OF THE SUNLIGHT THE BEAUTY OF THE PEOPLE. AND AS USUAL SUCH GENEROSITY AND LACK OF SHAME EMIT A MORE SECRET PERFUME. IN PARIS ONE CAN YEARN FOR SPACE AND FOR THE BEATING OF WINGS. HERE AT LEAST MAN HAS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS AND HIS DESIRES THUS ASSURED CAN TAKE THE MEASURE OF HIS RICHES.

ONE PROBABLY HAS TO LIVE A LONG TIME IN ALGIERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW DESICCATING AN EXCESS OF NATURE’S BLESSINGS CAN BE. THERE IS NOTHING HERE FOR PEOPLE SEEKING KNOWLEDGE EDUCATION OR SELF-IMPROVEMENT. THE LAND CONTAINS NO LESSONS. IT NEITHER PROMISES NOR REVEALS ANYTHING. IT IS CONTENT TO GIVE BUT DOES SO PROFUSELY. EVERYTHING HERE CAN BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE AND IS KNOWN THE VERY MOMENT IT IS ENJOYED. THE PLEASURES HAVE NO REMEDIES AND THEIR JOYS REMAIN WITHOUT HOPE. WHAT THE LAND NEEDS ARE CLEAR-SIGHTED SOULS THAT IS TO SAY THOSE WITHOUT CONSOLATION. IT ASKS THAT WE MAKE AN ACT OF LUCIDITY AS ONE MAKES AN ACT OF FAITH. A STRANGE COUNTRY WHICH GIVES THE MEN IT NOURISHES BOTH THEIR SPLENDOR AND THEIR MISERY. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE SENSUAL RICHES THIS COUNTRY OFFERS SO PROFUSELY TO THE SENSITIVE PERSON SHOULD COINCIDE WITH THE MOST EXTREME DEPRIVATION. THERE IS NO TRUTH THAT DOES NOT ALSO CARRY BITTERNESS. WHY THEN SHOULD IT BE SURPRISING IF I NEVER LOVE THE FACE OF THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN IN THE MIDST OF ITS POOREST INHABITANTS?

THROUGHOUT THEIR YOUTH MEN FIND A LIFE HERE THAT MATCHES THEIR BEAUTY. DECLINE AND FORGETFULNESS COME LATER. THEY HAVE WAGERED ON THE FLESH KNOWING THEY WOULD LOSE. IN ALGIERS TO THE YOUNG AND VITAL EVERYTHING IS A REFUGE AND A PRETEXT FOR REJOICING: THE BAY THE SUN GAMES ON THE RED AND WHITE TERRACES OVERLOOKING THE SEA THE FLOWERS AND STADIUMS THE COOL-LIMBED GIRLS. BUT FOR THE MAN WHO HAS LOST HIS YOUTH THERE IS NOTHING TO HANG ON TO AND NO OUTLET FOR MELANCHOLY. ELSEWHERE—ON ITALIAN TERRACES IN EUROPEAN CLOISTERS OR IN THE SHAPE OF THE HILLS IN PROVENCE—THERE ARE PLACES WHERE A MAN CAN SHED HIS HUMANITY AND GENTLY FIND SALVATION FROM HIMSELF. BUT EVERYTHING HERE DEMANDS SOLITUDE AND YOUNG BLOOD. ON HIS DEATHBED GOETHE CALLED FOR LIGHT AND THIS IS A HISTORIC REMARK. IN BELCOURT AND BAB-EL-OUED OLD MEN SITTING AT THE BACK OF CAFÉS LISTEN TO THE YOUNG WITH BRILLIANTINED HAIR BOASTING OF THEIR EXPLOITS.

IT IS SUMMER IN ALGIERS THAT GRANTS US THESE BEGINNINGS AND THESE ENDINGS. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THE TOWN IS DESERTED. BUT THE POOR AND THE SKY REMAIN. WE GO DOWN WITH THEM TO THE HARBOR AND ITS TREASURES: THE WATER’S GENTLE WARMTH AND THE WOMEN’S BROWN BODIES. IN THE EVENING SWOLLEN WITH THESE RICHES THE PEOPLE RETURN TO OILCLOTH AND KEROSENE LAMP THE MEAGER FURNITURE OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

IN ALGIERS YOU DON’T TALK ABOUT “GOING SWIMMING” BUT ABOUT “KNOCKING OFF A SWIM.” I WON’T INSIST. PEOPLE SWIM IN THE HARBOR AND THEN GO REST ON THE BUOYS. WHEN YOU PASS A BUOY WHERE A PRETTY GIRL IS SITTING YOU SHOUT TO YOUR FRIENDS: “I TELL YOU IT’S A SEAGULL.” THESE ARE HEALTHY PLEASURES. THEY CERTAINLY SEEM IDEAL TO THE YOUNG MEN SINCE MOST OF THEM CONTINUE THIS LIFE DURING THE WINTER STRIPPING DOWN FOR A FRUGAL LUNCH IN THE SUN AT NOONTIME EVERY DAY. NOT THAT THEY HAVE READ THE BORING SERMONS OF OUR NUDISTS THOSE PROTESTANTS OF THE BODY (THERE IS A WAY OF SYSTEMATIZING THE BODY THAT IS AS EXASPERATING AS SYSTEMS FOR THE SOUL). THEY JUST “LIKE BEING IN THE SUN.” IT WOULD BE HARD TO EXAGGERATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CUSTOM IN OUR DAY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS THE BODY HAS BEEN SHOWN NAKED ON THE BEACHES. FOR TWENTY CENTURIES MEN HAVE STRIVED TO IMPOSE DECENCY ON THE INSOLENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE GREEKS TO DIMINISH THE FLESH AND ELABORATE OUR DRESS. TODAY REACHING BACK OVER THIS HISTORY YOUNG MEN SPRINTING ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES ARE REDISCOVERING THE MAGNIFICENT MOTION OF THE ATHLETES OF DELOS. LIVING SO CLOSE TO OTHER BODIES AND THROUGH ONE’S OWN BODY ONE FINDS IT HAS ITS OWN NUANCES ITS OWN LIFE AND TO VENTURE AN ABSURDITY ITS OWN PSYCHOLOGY.2 THE EVOLUTION OF THE BODY LIKE THAT OF THE MIND HAS ITS HISTORY ITS REVERSALS ITS GAINS AND ITS LOSSES. WITH ONLY THIS NUANCE: COLOR. SWIMMING IN THE HARBOR IN THE SUMMERTIME YOU NOTICE THAT EVERYBODY’S SKIN CHANGES AT THE SAME TIME FROM WHITE TO GOLD THEN TO BROWN AND AT LAST TO A TOBACCO HUE THE FINAL STAGE THE BODY CAN ATTAIN IN ITS QUEST FOR TRANSFORMATION. OVERLOOKING THE HARBOR IS A PATTERN OF WHITE CUBES THE CASBAH. FROM WATER LEVEL PEOPLE’S BODIES FORM A BRONZED FRIEZE AGAINST THE GLARING WHITE BACKGROUND OF THE ARAB TOWN. AND AS ONE MOVES INTO AUGUST AND THE SUN GROWS STRONGER THE WHITE OF THE HOUSES GROWS MORE BLINDING AND THE SKINS TAKE ON A DARKER GLOW. HOW THEN CAN ONE KEEP FROM FEELING A PART OF THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN STONE AND FLESH KEEPING PACE WITH THE SUN AND THE SEASONS? ONE SPENDS WHOLE MORNINGS DIVING TO PEALS OF LAUGHTER IN SPLASHING WATER ON LONG CANOE TRIPS PADDLING AROUND THE RED AND BLACK FREIGHTERS (THE NORWEGIAN ONES SMELL OF ALL SORTS OF WOOD THE GERMAN ONES REEK OF OIL THE ONES GOING FROM PORT TO PORT ALONG THE COAST SMELL OF WINE AND OLD CASKS). AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN SPILLS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE SKY AN ORANGE CANOE LADEN WITH BROWN BODIES CARRIES US HOME IN ONE MAD SPRINT. AND WHEN SUDDENLY CEASING THE RHYTHMIC STROKING OF ITS DOUBLE FRUIT-COLORED WINGS WE GLIDE INTO THE QUIET INNER HARBOR HOW CAN I DOUBT THAT WHAT I LEAD ACROSS THE SILKEN WATERS IS A CARGO OF TAWNY GODS IN WHOM I RECOGNIZE MY BROTHERS?

AT THE OTHER END OF TOWN SUMMER ALREADY OFFERS US THE CONTRAST OF ITS OTHER WEALTH: I MEAN ITS SILENCES AND BOREDOM. THESE SILENCES DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME QUALITY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY OCCUR IN SHADOW OR SUNLIGHT. THERE IS A NOONTIME SILENCE ON THE GOVERNMENT SQUARE. IN THE SHADE OF THE TREES THAT GROW ALONG EACH SIDE ARABS SELL PENNY GLASSES OF ICED LEMONADE PERFUMED WITH ORANGE BLOSSOM. THEIR CRY OF “COOL COOL” ECHOES ACROSS THE EMPTY SQUARE. WHEN IT FADES AWAY SILENCE FALLS AGAIN UNDER THE SUN: ICE MOVES IN THE MERCHANT’S PITCHER AND I CAN HEAR IT TINKLING. THERE IS A SIESTA SILENCE. ON THE STREETS AROUND THE DOCKS IN FRONT OF THE SQUALID BARBER SHOPS ONE CAN MEASURE IT IN THE MELODIOUS BUZZING OF THE FLIES BEHIND THE HOLLOW REED CURTAINS. ELSEWHERE IN THE MOORISH CAFÉS OF THE CASBAH IT IS BODIES THAT ARE SILENT THAT CANNOT DRAG THEMSELVES AWAY LEAVE THE GLASS OF TEA AND REDISCOVER TIME IN THE BEATING OF THEIR PULSE. BUT ABOVE ALL THERE IS THE SILENCE OF THE SUMMER EVENINGS.

THESE BRIEF MOMENTS WHEN DAY TREMBLES INTO NIGHT MUST SWARM WITH SECRET SIGNS AND CALLS TO BE SO CLOSELY LINKED TO ALGIERS IN MY HEART. WHEN I HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME I THINK OF ITS TWILIGHTS AS PROMISES OF HAPPINESS. ON THE HILLS LOOKING DOWN OVER THE TOWN THERE ARE PATHS AMONG THE MASTIC AND THE OLIVE TREES. AND IT IS TOWARD THEM THAT MY HEART TURNS THEN. I CAN SEE SHEAVES OF BLACK BIRDS RISING AGAINST THE GREEN HORIZON. IN THE SKY SUDDENLY EMPTIED OF ITS SUN SOMETHING RELEASES ITS HOLD. A WHOLE FLOCK OF TINY RED CLOUDS STRETCHES UPWARD UNTIL IT DISSOLVES INTO THE AIR. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD APPEARS THE FIRST STAR WHICH HAD BEEN TAKING SHAPE AND GROWING HARDER IN THE THICKNESS OF THE HEAVENS. AND THEN SUDDEN AND ALL-ENVELOPING THE NIGHT. WHAT IS SO UNIQUE IN THESE FLEETING EVENINGS OF ALGIERS THAT THEY FREE SO MANY THINGS IN ME? THEY LEAVE A SWEETNESS ON MY LIPS THAT VANISHES INTO THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAVE TIME TO WEARY OF IT. IS THIS THE SECRET OF THEIR PERSISTENCE? THE TENDERNESS OF THIS COUNTRY IS OVERWHELMING AND FURTIVE. BUT AT LEAST OUR HEART GIVES WAY TO IT COMPLETELY. THE DANCE HALL AT PADOVANI BEACH IS OPEN EVERY DAY. AND IN THIS IMMENSE RECTANGULAR BOX OPEN TO THE SEA ALL ALONG ONE SIDE THE POOR YOUNGSTERS OF THE DISTRICT COME TO DANCE UNTIL EVENING. OFTEN I WOULD WAIT THERE FOR ONE PARTICULAR MOMENT. IN THE DAYTIME THE DANCE HALL IS PROTECTED BY A SLOPING WOODEN ROOF. WHEN THE SUN HAS GONE DOWN IT IS REMOVED. THE HALL FILLS WITH A STRANGE GREEN LIGHT BORN IN THE DOUBLE SHELL OF SKY AND SEA. WHEN YOU SIT FAR FROM THE WINDOWS YOU CAN SEE ONLY THE SKY AND LIKE PUPPETS IN A SHADOW THEATER THE FACES OF THE DANCERS FLOATING PAST ONE AFTER ANOTHER. SOMETIMES THEY PLAY A WALTZ AND THE DARK PROFILES REVOLVE LIKE CUTOUT FIGURES ON A TURNTABLE. NIGHT COMES QUICKLY AND WITH IT THE LIGHTS. I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE THRILL AND THE SECRET ENCHANTMENT OF THIS SUBTLE MOMENT. I REMEMBER A MAGNIFICENT TALL GIRL WHO HAD DANCED ALL ONE AFTERNOON. SHE WAS WEARING A NECKLACE OF JASMINE ON HER CLOSE-FITTING BLUE DRESS WHICH WAS DAMP WITH SWEAT RIGHT DOWN THE BACK. SHE WAS LAUGHING AND THROWING BACK HER HEAD AS SHE DANCED. PASSING IN FRONT OF THE TABLES SHE LEFT BEHIND A MINGLED SCENT OF FLOWERS AND FLESH. WHEN EVENING CAME I COULD NO LONGER SEE HER BODY PRESSED AGAINST HER PARTNER BUT THE WHITE OF HER JASMINE AND THE BLACK OF HER HAIR SWIRLED ONE AFTER THE OTHER AGAINST THE SKY AND WHEN SHE THREW BACK HER BREASTS I COULD HEAR HER LAUGH AND SEE HER PARTNER’S SILHOUETTE LEAN SUDDENLY FORWARD. I OWE MY IDEA OF INNOCENCE TO EVENINGS LIKE THESE. AND I AM LEARNING NOT TO SEPARATE THESE BEINGS CHARGED WITH VIOLENCE FROM THE SKY IN WHICH THEIR DESIRES REVOLVE.

AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD MOVIE HOUSES IN ALGIERS THEY SOMETIMES SELL PASTILLES WITH ENGRAVED RED MOTTOES THAT EXPRESS EVERYTHING NEEDED FOR THE BIRTH OF LOVE: (A) QUESTIONS: “WHEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?”; “DO YOU LOVE ME?”; (B) REPLIES: “MADLY”; “NEXT SPRING.” AFTER HAVING PREPARED THE GROUND YOU PASS THEM TO THE GIRL NEXT TO YOU WHO ANSWERS IN KIND OR SIMPLY PLAYS DUMB. AT BELCOURT THERE HAVE BEEN MARRIAGES ARRANGED LIKE THIS WHOLE LIVES DECIDED IN AN EXCHANGE OF MINT CANDIES. AND THIS GIVES A GOOD PICTURE OF THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.

THE HALLMARK OF YOUTH PERHAPS IS A MAGNIFICENT VOCATION FOR EASY PLEASURES. BUT ABOVE ALL THE HASTE TO LIVE BORDERS ON EXTRAVAGANCE. IN BELCOURT AS IN BAB-EL-OUED PEOPLE MARRY YOUNG. THEY START WORK VERY EARLY AND EXHAUST THE RANGE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE IN TEN SHORT YEARS. A WORKINGMAN OF THIRTY HAS ALREADY PLAYED ALL HIS CARDS. HE WAITS FOR THE END WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AROUND HIM. HIS DELIGHTS HAVE BEEN SWIFT AND MERCILESS. SO HAS HIS LIFE. AND YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT HE IS BORN IN A LAND WHERE EVERYTHING IS GIVEN TO BE TAKEN AWAY. IN SUCH ABUNDANCE AND PROFUSION LIFE FOLLOWS THE CURVE OF THE GREAT PASSIONS SUDDEN DEMANDING GENEROUS. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE BUILT BUT TO BE BURNED UP. SO REFLECTION OR SELF-IMPROVEMENT ARE QUITE IRRELEVANT. THE NOTION OF HELL FOR EXAMPLE IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN AMUSING JOKE HERE. ONLY THE VERY VIRTUOUS ARE ALLOWED SUCH FANCIES. AND I EVEN THINK THAT VIRTUE IS A MEANINGLESS WORD IN ALGERIA. NOT THAT THESE MEN LACK PRINCIPLES. THEY HAVE THEIR CODE OF MORALITY WHICH IS VERY WELL DEFINED. YOU “DON’T LET YOUR MOTHER DOWN.” YOU SEE TO IT THAT YOUR WIFE IS RESPECTED IN THE STREET. YOU SHOW CONSIDERATION TO PREGNANT WOMEN. YOU DON’T ATTACK AN ENEMY TWO TO ONE BECAUSE “THAT’S DIRTY.” IF ANYONE FAILS TO OBSERVE THESE ELEMENTARY RULES “HE’S NOT A MAN” AND THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT. THIS SEEMS TO ME JUST AND STRONG. THERE ARE STILL MANY OF US WHO OBSERVE THE HIGHWAY CODE THE ONLY DISINTERESTED ONE I KNOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHOPKEEPER MORALITY IS UNKNOWN. I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THE FACES AROUND ME TAKE ON AN EXPRESSION OF PITY AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN BETWEEN TWO POLICEMEN. AND BEFORE FINDING OUT WHETHER THE MAN WAS A THIEF A PARRICIDE OR SIMPLY AN ECCENTRIC PEOPLE SAID: “POOR FELLOW” OR AGAIN WITH A TOUCH OF ADMIRATION: “HE’S A REAL PIRATE THAT ONE!”

THERE ARE PEOPLES BORN FOR PRIDE AND FOR LIFE. IT IS THEY WHO NOURISH THE MOST SINGULAR VOCATION FOR BOREDOM THEY TOO WHO FIND DEATH THE MOST REPULSIVE. APART FROM SENSUAL DELIGHTS ALGERIAN AMUSEMENTS ARE IDIOTIC. A BOWLING CLUB FRATERNAL SOCIETY DINNERS CHEAP MOVIES AND COMMUNAL CELEBRATIONS HAVE FOR YEARS NOW BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP THE OVER-THIRTY AGE GROUP ENTERTAINED. SUNDAYS IN ALGIERS ARE AMONG THE DREARIEST ANYWHERE. HOW WOULD THESE MINDLESS PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DISGUISE THE DEEP HORROR OF THEIR LIVES WITH MYTHS? IN ALGIERS EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH IS EITHER RIDICULOUS OR DETESTABLE. THE PEOPLE HAVE NEITHER RELIGION NOR IDOLS AND DIE ALONE AFTER HAVING LIVED IN A CROWD. I KNOW NO PLACE MORE HIDEOUS THAN THE CEMETERY ON THE BOULEVARD BRU WHICH IS OPPOSITE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD. A FEARFUL SADNESS RISES FROM THE ACCUMULATED BAD TASTE OF ITS BLACK MONUMENTS REVEALING DEATH’S TRUE FACE. “EVERYTHING PASSES” THE HEART-SHAPED EX-VOTOS READ “BUT MEMORY.” AND THEY ALL INSIST ON THE RIDICULOUS ETERNITY PROVIDED AT SO SMALL A PRICE BY THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO LOVED US. THE SAME PHRASES SERVE ALL FORMS OF DESPAIR. THEY ARE ADDRESSED TO THE DECEASED AND SPEAK IN THE SECOND PERSON SINGULAR: “OUR MEMORY WILL NEVER ABANDON THEE”—A GLOOMY PRETENSE BY MEANS OF WHICH ONE LENDS A BODY AND DESIRES TO WHAT IS AT BEST A BLACK LIQUID. IN ANOTHER SPOT IN THE MIDST OF A STUPEFYING DISPLAY OF FLOWERS AND MARBLE BIRDS IS THIS RECKLESS VOW: “NEVER SHALL THY GRAVE LACK FLOWERS.” BUT ONE IS QUICKLY REASSURED: THE WORDS ARE CARVED AROUND A GILDED STUCCO BOUQUET A GREAT TIMESAVER FOR THE LIVING (LIKE THOSE FLOWERS CALLED “EVERLASTING” WHICH OWE THEIR POMPOUS NAME TO THE GRATITUDE OF THOSE WHO STILL JUMP ON MOVING BUSES). SINCE ONE MUST MOVE WITH THE TIMES THE CLASSICAL WARBLER IS SOMETIMES REPLACED BY A BREATH-TAKING PEARLY AIRPLANE PILOTED BY A SILLY-LOOKING ANGEL WHO DISREGARDING ALL LOGIC HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH A MAGNIFICENT PAIR OF WINGS.

STILL HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT THESE IMAGES OF DEATH NEVER QUITE SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM LIFE? THE VALUES ARE CLOSELY LINKED. THE FAVORITE JOKE OF ALGERIAN UNDERTAKERS DRIVING BY IN AN EMPTY HEARSE IS TO SHOUT “LIKE A RIDE HONEY?” TO THE PRETTY GIRLS THEY MEET ALONG THE WAY. THERE IS NOTHING TO KEEP ONE FROM FINDING THIS SYMBOLIC IF IN SOMEWHAT BAD TASTE. IT MAY ALSO SEEM BLASPHEMOUS TO GREET THE NEWS OF SOMEONE’S DEATH WITH A WINK OF THE LEFT EYE AND THE COMMENT “POOR GUY HE WON’T SING ANY MORE.” OR LIKE THE WOMAN FROM ORAN WHO HAD NEVER LOVED HER HUSBAND: “THE LORD GAVE HIM TO ME THE LORD HATH TAKEN HIM AWAY.” BUT WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE I DON’T SEE WHAT IS SACRED ABOUT DEATH AND I AM ON THE CONTRARY VERY AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEAR AND RESPECT. EVERYTHING BREATHES THE HORROR OF DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS AN INVITATION TO LIFE. AND YET IT IS BENEATH THE WALLS OF THIS VERY CEMETERY THAT THE YOUNG MEN OF BELCOURT ARRANGE THEIR MEETINGS AND THE GIRLS LET THEMSELVES BE KISSED AND FONDLED.

I FULLY REALIZE THAT SUCH PEOPLE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE. INTELLIGENCE DOES NOT OCCUPY THE PLACE HERE THAT IT DOES IN ITALY. THIS RACE IS INDIFFERENT TO THE MIND. IT WORSHIPS AND ADMIRES THE BODY. FROM THIS COMES ITS STRENGTH ITS NAÏVE CYNICISM AND A PUERILE VANITY THAT LEADS IT TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED. PEOPLE COMMONLY REPROACH ITS “MENTALITY” THAT IS TO SAY ITS PARTICULAR MODE OF LIFE AND SET OF VALUES. AND IT IS TRUE THAT A CERTAIN INTENSITY OF LIVING INVOLVES SOME INJUSTICE. YET HERE ARE A PEOPLE WITH NO PAST WITH NO TRADITIONS THOUGH NOT WITHOUT POETRY. THEIR POETRY HAS A HARD SENSUAL QUALITY I KNOW VERY WELL; IT IS FAR FROM TENDER EVEN FROM THE TENDERNESS OF THE ALGERIAN SKY; IT IS THE ONLY POETRY IN FACT THAT MOVES ME AND RESTORES ME. THE OPPOSITE OF A CIVILIZED PEOPLE IS A CREATIVE ONE. THESE BARBARIANS LOUNGING ON THE BEACHES GIVE ME THE FOOLISH HOPE THAT PERHAPS WITHOUT KNOWING IT THEY ARE MODELING THE FACE OF A CULTURE WHERE MAN’S GREATNESS WILL FINALLY DISCOVER ITS TRUE VISAGE. THESE PEOPLE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THE PRESENT LIVE WITH NEITHER MYTHS NOR CONSOLATION. INVESTING ALL THEIR ASSETS ON THIS EARTH THEY ARE LEFT DEFENSELESS AGAINST DEATH. THE GIFTS OF PHYSICAL BEAUTY HAVE BEEN HEAPED UPON THEM. AND ALSO THE STRANGE GREEDINESS THAT ALWAYS GOES ALONG WITH WEALTH THAT HAS NO FUTURE. EVERYTHING PEOPLE DO IN ALGIERS REVEALS A DISTASTE FOR STABILITY AND A LACK OF REGARD FOR THE FUTURE. PEOPLE ARE IN A HURRY TO LIVE AND IF AN ART WERE TO BE BORN HERE IT WOULD CONFORM TO THE HATRED OF PERMANENCE THAT LED THE DORIANS TO CARVE THEIR FIRST COLUMN OUT OF WOOD. AND STILL YES ONE CAN FIND A CERTAIN MODERATION AS WELL AS A CONSTANT EXCESS IN THE STRAINED AND VIOLENT FACES OF THESE PEOPLE IN THIS SUMMER SKY EMPTIED OF TENDERNESS BENEATH WHICH ALL TRUTHS CAN BE TOLD AND ON WHICH NO DECEITFUL DIVINITY HAS TRACED THE SIGNS OF HOPE OR OF REDEMPTION. BETWEEN THIS SKY AND THE FACES TURNED TOWARD IT THERE IS NOTHING ON WHICH TO HANG A MYTHOLOGY A LITERATURE AN ETHIC OR A RELIGION—ONLY STONES FLESH STARS AND THOSE TRUTHS THE HAND CAN TOUCH.

TO FEEL ONE’S TIES TO A LAND ONE’S LOVE FOR CERTAIN MEN TO KNOW THERE IS ALWAYS A PLACE WHERE THE HEART CAN FIND REST—THESE ARE ALREADY MANY CERTAINTIES FOR ONE MAN’S LIFE. DOUBTLESS THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH. BUT AT CERTAIN MOMENTS EVERYTHING YEARNS FOR THIS HOMELAND OF THE SOUL. “YES IT IS TO THIS WE MUST RETURN.” WHAT IS STRANGE ABOUT FINDING ON EARTH THE UNITY PLOTINUS LONGED FOR? UNITY EXPRESSES ITSELF HERE IN TERMS OF SEA AND SKY. THE HEART SENSES IT THROUGH A CERTAIN TASTE OF THE FLESH THAT CONSTITUTES ITS BITTERNESS AND GREATNESS. I AM LEARNING THAT THERE IS NO SUPERHUMAN HAPPINESS NO ETERNITY OUTSIDE THE CURVE OF THE DAYS. THESE RIDICULOUS AND ESSENTIAL ASSETS THESE RELATIVE TRUTHS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT MOVE ME. I HAVE NOT ENOUGH SOUL TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER “IDEAL” ONES. NOT THAT WE SHOULD BEHAVE AS BEASTS BUT I CAN SEE NO POINT IN THE HAPPINESS OF ANGELS. ALL I KNOW IS THAT THIS SKY WILL LAST LONGER THAN I SHALL. AND WHAT CAN I CALL ETERNITY EXCEPT WHAT WILL CONTINUE AFTER MY DEATH? WHAT I AM EXPRESSING HERE IS NOT THE CREATURE’S COMPLACENCY ABOUT HIS CONDITION. IT IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO BE A MAN EVEN LESS TO BE A MAN WHO IS PURE. BUT TO BE PURE MEANS TO REDISCOVER THAT COUNTRY OF THE SOUL WHERE ONE’S KINSHIP WITH THE WORLD CAN BE FELT WHERE THE THROBBING OF ONE’S BLOOD MINGLES WITH THE VIOLENT PULSATIONS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN. IT IS A WELL-KNOWN FACT THAT WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE OUR HOMELAND AT THE MOMENT WE ARE ABOUT TO LOSE IT. MEN WHOSE SELF-TORMENTS ARE TOO GREAT ARE THOSE WHOM THEIR NATIVE LAND REJECTS. I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE CRUDE OR TO SEEM TO EXAGGERATE. BUT AFTER ALL WHAT DENIES ME IN THIS LIFE IS FIRST OF ALL WHAT KILLS ME. EVERYTHING THAT EXALTS LIFE AT THE SAME TIME INCREASES ITS ABSURDITY. IN THE ALGERIAN SUMMER I LEARN THAT ONLY ONE THING IS MORE TRAGIC THAN SUFFERING AND THAT IS THE LIFE OF A HAPPY MAN. BUT THIS CAN ALSO BE THE PATH TO A GREATER LIFE SINCE IT CAN TEACH US NOT TO CHEAT.

MANY PEOPLE IN FACT AFFECT A LOVE OF LIFE IN ORDER TO AVOID LOVE ITSELF. THEY TRY TO ENJOY THEMSELVES AND “TO EXPERIMENT.” BUT THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL ATTITUDE. IT TAKES A RARE VOCATION TO BECOME A SENSUALIST. A MAN LIVES OUT HIS LIFE WITHOUT THE HELP OF HIS MIND WITH ITS TRIUMPHS AND DEFEATS ITS SIMULTANEOUS LONELINESS AND COMPANIONSHIP. SEEING THOSE MEN FROM BELCOURT WHO WORK TAKE CARE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN OFTEN WITHOUT A WORD OF COMPLAINT I THINK THAT ONE CAN FEEL A CERTAIN SHAME. I CERTAINLY HAVE NO ILLUSIONS. THERE IS NOT MUCH LOVE IN THE LIVES I AM DESCRIBING. I SHOULD SAY RATHER THAT THERE IS NO LONGER VERY MUCH. BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE ELUDED NOTHING. THERE ARE SOME WORDS THAT I HAVE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD SUCH AS SIN. YET I THINK I KNOW THAT THESE MEN HAVE NEVER SINNED AGAINST LIFE. FOR IF THERE IS A SIN AGAINST LIFE IT LIES PERHAPS LESS IN DESPAIRING OF IT THAN IN HOPING FOR ANOTHER LIFE AND EVADING THE IMPLACABLE GRANDEUR OF THE ONE WE HAVE. THESE MEN HAVE NOT CHEATED. THEY WERE GODS OF THE SUMMER AT TWENTY IN THEIR THIRST FOR LIFE AND THEY ARE STILL GODS TODAY STRIPPED OF ALL HOPE. I HAVE SEEN TWO OF THEM DIE. THEY WERE FULL OF HORROR BUT SILENT. IT IS BETTER THAT WAY. FROM THE MASS OF HUMAN EVILS SWARMING IN PANDORA’S BOX THE GREEKS BROUGHT OUT HOPE AT THE VERY LAST AS THE MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL. I DON’T KNOW ANY SYMBOL MORE MOVING. FOR HOPE CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IS TANTAMOUNT TO RESIGNATION. AND TO LIVE IS NOT TO BE RESIGNED.

SUCH AT LEAST IS THE BITTER LESSON OF SUMMERS IN ALGIERS. BUT ALREADY THE SEASON TREMBLES AND THE SUMMER PASSES. AFTER SO MUCH VIOLENCE AND TENSION THE FIRST SEPTEMBER RAINS ARE LIKE THE FIRST TEARS OF A LIBERATED LAND AS IF FOR A FEW DAYS THIS COUNTRY WERE BATHED IN TENDERNESS. YET AT THE SAME TIME THE CAROB TREES EMIT THE SCENT OF LOVE ACROSS ALGERIA. IN THE EVENING OR AFTER THE RAIN THE WHOLE EARTH LIES ITS BELLY MOISTENED WITH A BITTER ALMOND-SCENTED SEED AT REST FROM HAVING YIELDED ALL SUMMER LONG TO THE SUN. AND ONCE AGAIN THIS FRAGRANCE CONSECRATES THE NUPTIALS OF MAN AND EARTH AND GIVES RISE IN US TO THE ONLY TRULY VIRILE LOVE IN THIS WORLD: ONE THAT IS GENEROUS AND WILL DIE.

THE SEA CLOSE BY

I GREW UP WITH THE SEA AND POVERTY FOR ME WAS SUMPTUOUS; THEN I LOST THE SEA AND FOUND ALL LUXURIES GRAY AND POVERTY UNBEARABLE. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN WAITING. I WAIT FOR THE HOMEBOUND SHIPS THE HOUSE OF THE WATERS THE LIMPIDITY OF DAY. I WAIT PATIENTLY AM POLITE WITH ALL MY STRENGTH. I AM SEEN WALKING BY ON FINE SOPHISTICATED STREETS I ADMIRE LANDSCAPES I APPLAUD LIKE EVERYONE SHAKE HANDS BUT IT IS NOT I WHO SPEAK. MEN PRAISE ME I DREAM A LITTLE THEY INSULT ME I SCARCELY SHOW SURPRISE. THEN I FORGET AND SMILE AT THE MAN WHO INSULTED ME OR AM TOO COURTEOUS IN GREETING THE PERSON I LOVE. CAN I HELP IT IF ALL I REMEMBER IS ONE IMAGE? FINALLY THEY SUMMON ME TO TELL THEM WHO I AM. “NOTHING YET NOTHING YET …”

I SURPASS MYSELF AT FUNERALS. TRULY I EXCEL. I WALK SLOWLY THROUGH THE IRON-STREWN SUBURBS TAKING THE WIDE LANES PLANTED WITH CEMENT TREES THAT LEAD TO HOLES IN THE COLD GROUND. THERE BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY REDDENED BANDAGE OF THE SKY I WATCH BOLD WORKMEN INTER MY FRIENDS BENEATH SIX FEET OF EARTH. IF I TOSS THE FLOWER A CLAY-COVERED HAND HOLDS OUT TO ME IT NEVER MISSES THE GRAVE. MY PIETY IS EXACT MY FEELINGS AS THEY SHOULD BE MY HEAD SUITABLY INCLINED. I AM ADMIRED FOR FINDING JUST THE RIGHT WORD. BUT I TAKE NO CREDIT: I AM WAITING.

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES I STUMBLE I LOSE MY TOUCH SUCCESS EVADES ME. WHAT DOES IT MATTER I AM ALONE THEN. I WAKE UP AT NIGHT AND STILL HALF ASLEEP THINK I HEAR THE SOUND OF WAVES THE BREATHING OF WATERS. FULLY AWAKE I RECOGNIZE THE WIND IN THE TREES AND THE SAD MURMUR OF THE EMPTY TOWN. AFTERWARD ALL MY ART IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HIDE MY ANGUISH OR CLOTHE IT IN THE PREVAILING FASHION.

AT OTHER TIMES IT’S THE OPPOSITE AND I AM HELPED. ON CERTAIN DAYS IN NEW YORK LOST AT THE BOTTOM OF THOSE STONE AND STEEL SHAFTS WHERE MILLIONS OF MEN WANDER I WOULD RUN FROM ONE SHAFT TO THE NEXT WITHOUT SEEING WHERE THEY ENDED UNTIL EXHAUSTED I WAS SUSTAINED ONLY BY THE HUMAN MASS SEEKING ITS WAY OUT. BUT EACH TIME THERE WAS THE DISTANT HONKING OF A TUGBOAT TO REMIND ME THAT THIS EMPTY WELL OF A CITY WAS AN ISLAND AND THAT OFF THE TIP OF THE BATTERY THE WATER OF MY BAPTISM LAY IN WAIT FOR ME BLACK AND ROTTING COVERED WITH HOLLOW CORKS.

THUS I WHO OWN NOTHING WHO HAVE GIVEN AWAY MY FORTUNE WHO CAMP IN ALL MY HOUSES AM STILL HEAPED WHEN I CHOOSE WITH EVERY BLESSING; I CAN SET SAIL AT ANY HOUR A STRANGER TO DESPAIR. THERE IS NO COUNTRY FOR THOSE WHO DESPAIR BUT I KNOW THAT THE SEA PRECEDES AND FOLLOWS ME AND I HOLD MY MADNESS READY. THOSE WHO LOVE AND ARE SEPARATED CAN LIVE IN GRIEF BUT THIS IS NOT DESPAIR: THEY KNOW THAT LOVE EXISTS. THIS IS WHY I SUFFER DRY-EYED IN EXILE. I AM STILL WAITING. A DAY COMES AT LAST …

THE SAILORS’ BARE FEET BEAT SOFTLY ON THE DECK. WE ARE SETTING SAIL AT DAYBREAK. THE MOMENT WE LEAVE THE HARBOR A SHORT GUSTY WIND VIGOROUSLY BRUSHES THE SEA WHICH CURLS BACKWARD IN SMALL FOAMLESS WAVES. A LITTLE LATER THE WIND FRESHENS AND STREWS THE SEA WITH SWIFTLY VANISHING CAMELLIAS. THUS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING WE HEAR OUR SAILS SLAPPING ABOVE A CHEERFUL POND. THE WATERS ARE HEAVY SCALY COVERED WITH COOL FROTH. FROM TIME TO TIME THE WAVES LAP AGAINST THE BOW; A BITTER UNCTUOUS FOAM THE GODS’ SALIVA FLOWS ALONG THE WOOD AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE WATER WHERE IT SCATTERS INTO SHAPES THAT DIE AND ARE REBORN THE HIDE OF SOME WHITE AND BLUE COW AN EXHAUSTED BEAST THAT FLOATS FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR WAKE.

EVER SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE SEAGULLS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING OUR SHIP APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT ALMOST WITHOUT MOVING THEIR WINGS. THEIR FINE STRAIGHT NAVIGATION SCARCELY LEANS UPON THE BREEZE. SUDDENLY A LOUD PLOP AT THE LEVEL OF THE KITCHENS STIRS UP A GREEDY ALARM AMONG THE BIRDS THROWING THEIR FINE FLIGHT INTO CONFUSION AND SENDING UP A FIRE OF WHITE WINGS. THE SEAGULLS WHIRL MADLY IN EVERY DIRECTION AND THEN WITH NO LOSS OF SPEED DROP FROM THE FIGHT ONE BY ONE AND DIVE TOWARD THE SEA. A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY ARE TOGETHER AGAIN ON THE WATER A QUARRELSOME FARMYARD THAT WE LEAVE BEHIND NESTING IN THE HOLLOW OF THE WAVE SLOWLY PICKING THROUGH THE MANNA OF THE SCRAPS.

AT NOON UNDER A DEAFENING SUN THE SEA IS SO EXHAUSTED IT SCARCELY FINDS THE STRENGTH TO RISE. WHEN IT FALLS BACK ON ITSELF IT MAKES THE SILENCE WHISTLE. AFTER AN HOUR’S COOKING THE PALE WATER A VAST WHITE-HOT IRON SHEET SIZZLES. IN A MINUTE IT WILL TURN AND OFFER ITS DAMP SIDE NOW HIDDEN IN WAVES AND DARKNESS TO THE SUN.

WE PASS THE GATES OF HERCULES THE HEADLAND WHERE ANTAEUS DIED. BEYOND THERE IS OCEAN EVERYWHERE; ON ONE SIDE WE PASS THE HORN AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE MERIDIANS WED THE LATITUDES THE PACIFIC DRINKS THE ATLANTIC. AT ONCE SETTING COURSE FOR VANCOUVER WE SAIL SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTH SEAS. A FEW CABLE LENGTHS AWAY EASTER ISLAND DESOLATION AND THE NEW HEBRIDES FILE PAST US IN CONVOY. SUDDENLY ONE MORNING THE SEAGULLS DISAPPEAR. WE ARE FAR FROM ANY LAND AND ALONE WITH OUR SAILS AND OUR ENGINES.

ALONE ALSO WITH THE HORIZON. THE WAVES COME FROM THE INVISIBLE EAST PATIENTLY ONE BY ONE; THEY REACH US AND THEN PATIENTLY SET OFF AGAIN FOR THE UNKNOWN WEST ONE BY ONE. A LONG VOYAGE WITH NO BEGINNING AND NO END … RIVERS AND STREAMS PASS BY THE SEA PASSES AND REMAINS. THIS IS HOW ONE OUGHT TO LOVE FAITHFUL AND FLEETING. I WED THE SEA.

THE HIGH SEAS. THE SUN SINKS AND IS SWALLOWED BY THE FOG LONG BEFORE IT REACHES THE HORIZON. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THE SEA IS PINK ON ONE SIDE AND BLUE ON THE OTHER. THEN THE WATERS GROW DARKER. THE SCHOONER SLIDES MINUTE OVER THE SURFACE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE OF THICK TARNISHED METAL. AND AT THE MOST PEACEFUL HOUR AS EVENING COMES HUNDREDS OF PORPOISES EMERGE FROM THE WATER FROLIC AROUND US FOR A MOMENT THEN FLEE TO THE HORIZON WHERE THERE ARE NO MEN. WITH THEM GONE SILENCE AND THE ANGUISH OF PRIMITIVE WATERS ARE WHAT REMAIN.

•  •  •

A LITTLE LATER STILL WE MEET AN ICEBERG ON THE TROPIC. INVISIBLE TO BE SURE AFTER ITS LONG VOYAGE IN THESE WARM WATERS BUT STILL EFFECTIVE: IT PASSES TO STARBOARD WHERE THE RIGGING IS BRIEFLY COVERED WITH A FROSTY DEW WHILE TO PORT THE DAY DIES WITHOUT MOISTURE.

NIGHT DOES NOT FALL AT SEA. IT RISES RATHER TOWARD THE STILL PALE SKY FROM THE DEPTHS OF WATERS AN ALREADY DROWNED SUN GRADUALLY DARKENS WITH ITS THICK ASHES. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT VENUS SHINES ALONE ABOVE THE BLACK WAVES. IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE STARS SWARM IN THE LIQUID NIGHT.

THE MOON HAS RISEN. FIRST IT LIGHTS THE WATER’S SURFACE GENTLY THEN CLIMBS HIGHER AND INSCRIBES ITSELF IN THE SUPPLE WATER. AT LAST AT ITS ZENITH IT LIGHTS A WHOLE CORRIDOR OF SEA A RICH RIVER OF MILK WHICH WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP STREAMS DOWN INEXHAUSTIBLY TOWARD US ACROSS THE DARK OCEAN. HERE IS THE FAITHFUL NIGHT THE COOL NIGHT I CALLED FOR IN THE ROLLICKING LIGHTS THE ALCOHOL THE TUMULT OF DESIRE.

WE SAIL ACROSS SPACES SO VAST THEY SEEM UNENDING. SUN AND MOON RISE AND FALL IN TURN ON THE SAME THREAD OF LIGHT AND NIGHT. DAYS AT SEA AS SIMILAR EACH TO THE OTHER AS HAPPINESS …

THIS LIFE REBELLIOUS TO FORGETFULNESS REBELLIOUS TO MEMORY THAT STEVENSON SPEAKS OF.

DAWN. WE SAIL PERPENDICULARLY ACROSS THE TROPIC OF CANCER THE WATERS GROAN AND ARE CONVULSED. DAY BREAKS OVER A SURGING SEA FULL OF STEEL SPANGLES. THE SKY IS WHITE WITH MIST AND HEAT WITH A DEAD BUT UNBEARABLE GLARE AS IF THE SUN HAD TURNED LIQUID IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CLOUDS OVER THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF THE CELESTIAL VAULT. A SICK SKY OVER A DECOMPOSING SEA. AS THE DAY DRAWS ON THE HEAT GROWS IN THE WHITE AIR. ALL DAY LONG OUR BOW NOSES OUT CLOUDS OF FLYING FISH TINY IRON BIRDS FORCING THEM FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES IN THE WAVES.

IN THE AFTERNOON WE MEET A STEAMER BOUND FOR HOME. THE SALUTE OUR FOGHORNS EXCHANGE WITH THREE GREAT PREHISTORIC HOOTS THE SIGNALS OF PASSENGERS LOST AT SEA WARNING THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS PRESENT THE GRADUALLY INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SHIPS THEIR SEPARATION AT LAST ON THE MALEVOLENT WATERS ALL THIS FILLS THE HEART WITH PAIN. THESE STUBBORN MADMEN CLINGING TO PLANKS TOSSED UPON THE MANE OF IMMENSE OCEANS IN PURSUIT OF DRIFTING ISLANDS: WHAT MAN WHO CHERISHES SOLITUDE AND THE SEA WILL EVER KEEP HIMSELF FROM LOVING THEM?

IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC WE BEND BENEATH THE SAVAGE WINDS THAT BLOW ENDLESSLY FROM POLE TO POLE. EACH CRY WE UTTER IS LOST FLIES OFF INTO LIMITLESS SPACE. BUT THIS SHOUT CARRIED DAY AFTER DAY ON THE WINDS WILL FINALLY REACH LAND AT ONE OF THE FLATTENED ENDS OF THE EARTH AND ECHO TIMELESSLY AGAINST THE FROZEN WALLS UNTIL A MAN LOST SOMEWHERE IN HIS SHELL OF SNOW HEARS IT AND WANTS TO SMILE WITH HAPPINESS.

I WAS HALF ASLEEP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON SUN WHEN A TERRIBLE NOISE AWOKE ME. I SAW THE SUN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA THE WAVES REIGNING IN THE SURGING HEAVENS. SUDDENLY THE SEA WAS AFIRE THE SUN FLOWED IN LONG ICY DRAUGHTS DOWN MY THROAT. THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND WEPT AROUND ME. THEY LOVED BUT COULD NOT FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER. I RECOGNIZED THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS THAT DAY. I DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT ITS GOOD MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME BE EVIL AND ITS TRANSGRESSIONS BENEFICIAL. I REALIZED THAT DAY THAT THERE WERE TWO TRUTHS AND THAT ONE OF THEM OUGHT NEVER TO BE UTTERED.

THE CURIOUS AUSTRAL MOON LOOKING SLIGHTLY PARED KEEPS US COMPANY FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AND THEN SLIDES RAPIDLY FROM THE SKY INTO THE SEA WHICH SWALLOWS IT. THE SOUTHERN CROSS THE INFREQUENT STARS THE POROUS AIR REMAIN. AT THE SAME INSTANT THE WIND CEASES. THE SKY ROLLS AND PITCHES ABOVE OUR IMMOBILE MASTS. ENGINE DEAD SAILS HOVE TO WE ARE WHISTLING IN THE WARM NIGHT AS THE WATER BEATS AMICABLY AGAINST OUR SIDES. NO COMMANDS THE MACHINES ARE SILENT. WHY INDEED SHOULD WE CONTINUE AND WHY RETURN? OUR CUP RUNNETH OVER A MUTE RAPTURE LULLS US INVINCIBLY TO SLEEP. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE THIS WHEN ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED; WE MUST LET OURSELVES FLOW WITH THEM LIKE SWIMMERS WHO KEEP ON UNTIL EXHAUSTED. WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH? I HAVE ALWAYS CONCEALED IT FROM MYSELF. OH BITTER BED PRINCELY COUCH THE CROWN LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAS.

IN THE MORNING THE LUKEWARM WATER FOAMS GENTLY UNDER OUR PROPELLER. WE PUT ON SPEED. TOWARD NOON TRAVELING FROM DISTANT CONTINENTS A HERD OF WALRUSES CROSS OUR PATH OVERTAKE US AND SWIM RHYTHMICALLY TO THE NORTH FOLLOWED BY MULTICOLORED BIRDS WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME ALIGHT UPON THEIR TUSKS. THIS RUSTLING FOREST SLOWLY VANISHES ON THE HORIZON. A LITTLE LATER THE SEA IS COVERED WITH STRANGE YELLOW FLOWERS. TOWARD EVENING FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR WE ARE PRECEDED BY AN INVISIBLE SONG. COMFORTABLY I FALL ASLEEP.

ALL SAILS STRETCHED TO THE KEEN BREEZE WE SKIM ACROSS A CLEAR AND RIPPLING SEA. AT TOP SPEED OUR HELM GOES HARD TO PORT. AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL CORRECTING OUR COURSE AGAIN LISTING SO FAR TO STARBOARD THAT OUR SAILS SKIM THE WATER WE SAIL RAPIDLY ALONG THE SIDE OF A SOUTHERN CONTINENT I RECOGNIZE FROM HAVING ONCE FLOWN BLINDLY OVER IT IN THE BARBAROUS COFFIN OF AN AIRPLANE. I WAS AN IDLE KING AND MY CHARIOT DAWDLED; I WAITED FOR THE SEA BUT IT NEVER CAME. THE MONSTER ROARED TOOK OFF FROM THE GUANO FIELDS OF PERU HURLED ITSELF ABOVE THE BEACHES OF THE PACIFIC FLEW OVER THE FRACTURED WHITE VERTEBRAE OF THE ANDES AND THEN ABOVE THE HERDS OF FLIES THAT COVER THE IMMENSE ARGENTINIAN PLAIN LINKING IN ONE SWOOP THE MILK-DROWNED URUGUAYAN MEADOWS TO VENEZUELA’S BLACK RIVERS LANDING ROARING AGAIN QUIVERING WITH GREED AT THE SIGHT OF NEW EMPTY SPACES TO DEVOUR AND YET NEVER FAILING TO MOVE FORWARD OR AT LEAST DOING SO ONLY WITH A CONVULSED OBSTINATE SLOWNESS A FIXED WEARY AND INTOXICATED ENERGY. I FELT I WAS DYING IN THIS METALLIC CELL AND DREAMED OF BLOODSHED AND ORGIES. WITHOUT SPACE THERE IS NEITHER INNOCENCE NOR LIBERTY! WHEN A MAN CANNOT BREATHE PRISON MEANS DEATH OR MADNESS; WHAT CAN HE DO THERE BUT KILL AND POSSESS? BUT TODAY I HAVE ALL THE AIR I NEED ALL OUR SAILS SLAP IN THE BLUE AIR I AM GOING TO SHOUT AT THE SPEED WE’LL TOSS OUR SEXTANTS AND COMPASSES INTO THE SEA.

OUR SAILS ARE LIKE IRON UNDER THE IMPERIOUS WIND. THE COAST DRIFTS AT FULL SPEED BEFORE OUR EYES FORESTS OF ROYAL COCONUT TREES WHOSE FEET ARE BATHED BY EMERALD LAGOONS A QUIET BAY FULL OF RED SAILS MOONLIT BEACHES. GREAT BUILDINGS LOOM UP ALREADY CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE VIRGIN FOREST THAT BEGINS IN THE BACK YARDS; HERE AND THERE A YELLOW IPECAC OR A TREE WITH VIOLET BRANCHES BURSTS THROUGH A WINDOW; RIO FINALLY CRUMBLES AWAY BEHIND US AND THE MONKEYS OF THE TIJUCA WILL LAUGH AND GIBBER IN THE VEGETATION THAT WILL COVER ITS NEW RUINS. FASTER STILL ALONG WIDE BEACHES WHERE THE WAVES SPREAD OUT IN SHEAVES OF SAND FASTER STILL WHERE THE URUGUAYAN SHEEP WADE INTO THE SEA AND INSTANTLY TURN IT YELLOW. THEN ON THE ARGENTINIAN COAST GREAT CRUDE PILES OF FAGGOTS SET UP AT REGULAR INTERVALS RAISE SLOWLY GRILLING HALVES OF OXEN TO THE SKY. AT NIGHT THE ICE FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO COMES AND BEATS FOR HOURS AGAINST OUR HULL THE SHIP HARDLY LOSES SPEED AND TACKS ABOUT. IN THE MORNING THE SINGLE WAVE OF THE PACIFIC WHOSE COLD FOAM BOILS GREEN AND WHITE FOR THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS ALONG THE CHILEAN COAST SLOWLY LIFTS US UP AND THREATENS TO WRECK US. THE HELM AVOIDS IT OVERTAKES THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS. IN THE SWEETISH EVENING THE FIRST MALAYAN BOATS COME OUT TO MEET US.

“TO SEA! TO SEA!” SHOUTED THE MARVELOUS BOYS IN ONE OF THE BOOKS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT BOOK EXCEPT THIS CRY. “TO SEA!” AND ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN INTO THE CORRIDOR OF THE RED SEA WHERE ON SILENT NIGHTS ONE CAN HEAR THE DESERT STONES SCORCHED IN THE DAYTIME FREEZE AND CRACK ONE BY ONE AS WE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT SEA IN WHICH ALL CRIES ARE HUSHED.

FINALLY ONE MORNING WE DROP ANCHOR IN A BAY FILLED WITH A STRANGE SILENCE BEACONED WITH FIXED SAILS. A FEW SEA BIRDS ARE QUARRELLING IN THE SKY OVER SCRAPS OF REEDS. WE SWIM ASHORE TO AN EMPTY BEACH; ALL DAY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND DRYING OFF ON THE SAND. WHEN EVENING COMES UNDER A SKY THAT TURNS GREEN AND FADES INTO THE DISTANCE THE SEA ALREADY CALM GROWS MORE PEACEFUL STILL. SHORT WAVES SHOWER VAPOROUS FOAM ON THE LUKEWARM SHORE. THE SEA BIRDS HAVE DISAPPEARED. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS SPACE OPEN TO A MOTIONLESS VOYAGE.

KNOWING THAT CERTAIN NIGHTS WHOSE SWEETNESS LINGERS WILL KEEP RETURNING TO THE EARTH AND SEA AFTER WE ARE GONE YES THIS HELPS US DIE. GREAT SEA EVER IN MOTION EVER VIRGIN MY RELIGION ALONG WITH NIGHT! IT WASHES AND SATIATES US IN ITS STERILE BILLOWS FREES US AND HOLDS US UPRIGHT. EACH BREAKER BRINGS ITS PROMISE ALWAYS THE SAME. WHAT DOES EACH SAY? IF I WERE TO DIE SURROUNDED BY COLD MOUNTAINS IGNORED BY THE WORLD AN OUTCAST AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH AT THE FINAL MOMENT THE SEA WOULD FLOOD MY CELL WOULD LIFT ME ABOVE MYSELF AND HELP ME DIE WITHOUT HATRED.

AT MIDNIGHT ALONE ON THE SHORE. A MOMENT MORE AND I SHALL SET SAIL. THE SKY ITSELF HAS WEIGHED ANCHOR WITH ALL ITS STARS LIKE THE SHIPS COVERED WITH LIGHTS WHICH AT THIS VERY HOUR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ILLUMINATE DARK HARBORS. SPACE AND SILENCE WEIGH EQUALLY UPON THE HEART. A SUDDEN LOVE A GREAT WORK A DECISIVE ACT A THOUGHT THAT TRANSFIGURES ALL THESE AT CERTAIN MOMENTS BRING THE SAME UNBEARABLE ANXIETY QUICKENED WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM. LIVING LIKE THIS IN THE DELICIOUS ANGUISH OF BEING IN EXQUISITE PROXIMITY TO A DANGER WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW IS THIS THE SAME AS RUSHING TO OUR DOOM? ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT RESPITE LET US RACE TO OUR DESTRUCTION.

I HAVE ALWAYS FELT I LIVED ON THE HIGH SEAS THREATENED AT THE HEART OF A ROYAL HAPPINESS.

ONCE I HAD A 'SELF; NOW I AM NO MORE THAN AN OBJECT .. . I GORGE MYSELF ON ALL THE DRUGS OF SOLITUDE; THOSE OF THE WORLD WERE TOO WEAK TO MAKE ME FORGET IT. HAVING KILLED THE PROPHET IN ME HOW COULD I STILL HAVE A PLACE AMONG MEN?”

THEREBY WE FIND MORE PRESTIGE IN EXPRESSION THAN IN THE SOUL WHICH SUPPORTS IT IN GRACE THAN IN INTUITION; EMOTION ITSELF BECOMES POLITE.

THE SOLUTIONS OFFERED BY OUR ANCESTRAL COWARDICE ARE THE WORST DESERTIONS OF OUR DUTY TO INTELLECTUAL DECENCY. TO BE FOOLED TO LIVE AND DIE DUPED IS CERTAINLY WHAT MEN DO BUT THERE EXISTS A DIGNITY WHICH KEEPS US FROM DISAPPEARING INTO GOD AND WHICH TRANSFORMS ALL OUR MOMENTS INTO PRAYERS WE SHALL NEVER OFFER.

FROM THE CONFIGURATIONS AND ACCIDENTS OF TIME.

THE ABYSS OF TWO INCOMMUNICABLE WORLDS OPENS BETWEEN THE MAN WHO HAS THE SENTIMENT OF DEATH AND THE MAN WHO DOES NOT; YET BOTH DIE; BUT ONE IS UNAWARE OF HIS DEATH THE OTHER KNOWS- ONE DIES ONLY FOR A MOMENT THE OTHER UNCEASINGLY. . . . THEIR COMMON CONDITION LOCATES THEM PRECISELY AT EACH OTHER’S ANTIPODES AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES AND WITHIN ONE AND THE SAME DEFINITION; IRRECONCILABLE THEY SUFFER THE SAME FATE. . . . ONE LIVES AS IF HE WERE ETERNAL; THE OTHER THINKS CONTINUALLY OF HIS ETERNITY AND DENIES IT IN EACH THOUGHT.

THESE ARE FACTS THE HEART CAN FEEL;

AN ACT LIKE THIS IS PREPARED WITHIN THE SILENCE OF THE HEART AS IS A GREAT WORK OF ART.

KILLING YOURSELF AMOUNTS TO CONFESSING.

DYING VOLUNTARILY IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE RECOGNIZED EVEN INSTINCTIVELY THE RIDICULOUS CHARACTER OF THAT HABIT THE ABSENCE OF ANY PROFOUND REASON FOR LIVING THE INSANE CHARACTER OF THAT DAILY AGITATION AND THE USELESSNESS OF SUFFERING.

YOU GO TO SEE AN OLDER FRIEND TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING. OR AT LEAST THIS SOMETHING WHICH IS STIFLING YOU. BUT HE IS IN A HURRY. YOU TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING AND ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL. THE TIME TO SPEAK HAS GONE. AND HERE I AM MORE ALONE AND EMPTY THAN EVER.

WE SHALL COME EVEN TO DESIRE WHAT SUDDENLY LEAVES US SO ALONE.

AN ACT LIKE THIS IS PREPAREDWITHIN THE SILENCE OF THE HEART AS IS A GREAT WORK OF ART.

THE MIND'S DEEPEST DESIRE EVEN IN ITS MOST ELABORATE OPERATIONS PARALLELS MAN'S UNCONSCIOUS FEELING IN TH EFACE OF HIS UNIVERSE: IT IS AN INSISTENCE UPON FAMILIARITY AN APPETITE FOR CLARITY. UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD FOR A MAN IS REDUCING IT TO THE HUMAN STAMPING IT WITH HIS HEAL.

A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND CLOUDS. THE COLD SPANGLED WITH YELLOW. THE BAY TREMBLING WITH LIGHT LIKE A MOIST LIP. AND I HAVE WORKED ALL DAY.

ONE MUST NOT CUT ONESELF OFF FROM THE WORLD. NO ONE WHO LIVES IN THE SUNLIGHT MAKES A FAILURE OF HIS LIFE. MY WHOLE EFFORT WHATEVER THE SITUATION MISFORTUNE OR DISILLUSION MUST BE TO MAKE CONTACT AGAIN. BUT EVEN WITHIN THIS SADNESS I FEEL A GREAT LEAP OF JOY AND A GREAT DESIRE TO LOVE SIMPLY AT THE SIGHT OF THE HILL AGAINST THE EVENING SKY.

SMILING DESPAIR. NO SOLUTION BUT CONSTANTLY EXERCISING AN AUTHORITY OVER MYSELF THAT I KNOW IS USELESS. THE ESSENTIAL THING IS NOT TO LOSE ONESELF AND NOT TO LOSE THAT PART OF ONESELF THAT LIES SLEEPING IN THE WORLD.

IN THE MORNING THE TENDERNESS AND FRAGILITY OF THE ORANAIS REGION SO HARD AND VIOLEN UNDER THE DAYTIME SUN. BUT WITH A DELICACY AND GENTLENESS THAT ONE FEELS WILL SOON BE OVER.

THE NEED TO BE RIGHT—THE SIGN OF A VULGAR MIND.

IN THE EVENING THE GENTLENESS OF THE WORLD ON THE BAY. THERE ARE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD LIES DAYS WHEN IT TELLS THE TRUTH. IT IS TELLING THE TRUTH THIS EVENING—WITH WHAT SAD AND INSISTENT BEAUTY

IF WE KNEW OURSELVES PERFECTLY WE SHOULD DIE.

TO WRITE IS TO BECOME DISINTERESTED. THERE IS A CERTAIN RENUNCIATION IN ART. REWRITE—THE EFFORT ALWAYS BRINGS SOME PROFIT WHATEVER THIS MAY BE. 


TO BE DEEP THROUGH INSINCERITY.

BEAUTY WHICH GIVES US A LITTLE TASTE FOR POVERTY. I AM SO DISTANT FROM MY FEVER—SO LITTLE CAPABLE OF ANY PRIDE BUT THAT OF LOVING. KEEP AT A DISTANCE. I MUST EXPRESS WHAT FILLS MY HEART AND EXPRESS IT QUICKLY.

HOW UNBEARABLE FOR WOMEN IS THE TENDERNESS WHICH A MAN CAN GIVE THEM WITHOUT LOVE. FOR ME HOW BITTERSWEET THIS IS.

YET WHAT KIND OF DELUDED YOUNG LOVERS ARE WE? 

TIME PASSES. PERHAPS IT IS NO LONGER TIME THAT PASSES. PERHAPS I HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP OR I HAVE NOT SLEPT AND AM DREAMING. I WANT TO THINK IT IS ONLY A DREAM.
WHY DOES IT HAPPEN TO ME? I THOUGHT I HAD SLEPT ENOUGH?

I CAN FEEL MY LIFE EBBING AND FLOWING DYING AND BEING REBORN BEING RIPPED APART BY DISEASE AND BROKEN AND BORN AGAIN AND NOTHING IS EVER REALLY THE SAME. I CANNOT DIE OR I MUST NEVER DIE AND I KEEP DREAMING AND GOING BACK AND FORTH.

THE TRAJECTORY IS COMPLETE FROM LOGIC TO EPILEPSY... WHENCE THE BIRTH OF IDEOLOGIES DOCTRINES DEADLY GAMES.

A NEW WORLD... ALL LIES WITHIN OUR GRASP FOR THE END IS NIGH. WE ARE TO BE HIS TOOLS.  THE DEATH OF THE MASTER IS THE BIRTH OF THE SLAVE.

IT IS A PATH THAT LEADS TO DEATH. THE PATH IS TO BE FOLLOWED NOT ONLY BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE

NAUSEA COMES AND GOES BUT IT'S AN ILLNESS THAT ISN'T GOING AWAY.

I ASK OF PEOPLE MORE THAN THEY CAN GIVE ME. IT IS USELESS TO MAINTAIN THE CONTRARY. BUT WHAT A MISTAKE AND WHAT DESPAIR. AND MYSELF PERHAPS...

IN MY LIFE THE PAST HAS A LARGE PORTION OF MY HAPPINESS. TODAY IT TAKES QUITE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THAT PART OF MY HEART. 


MORNING THINKING OF EMPIRE

WE PRESS OUR LIPS TO THE ENAMELED RIM OF THE CUPS

AND KNOW THIS GREASE THAT FLOATS

OVER THE COFFEE WILL ONE DAY STOP OUR HEARTS.

EYES AND FINGERS DROP ONTO SILVERWARE

THAT IS NOT SILVERWARE. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WAVES

BEAT AGAINST THE CHIPPED WALLS OF THE OLD CITY.

YOUR HANDS RISE FROM THE ROUGH TABLECLOTH

AS IF TO PROPHESY. YOUR LIPS TREMBLE…

I WANT TO SAY TO HELL WITH THE FUTURE.

OUR FUTURE LIES DEEP IN THE AFTERNOON.

IT IS A NARROW STREET WITH A CART AND DRIVER

A DRIVER WHO LOOKS AT US AND HESITATES

THEN SHAKES HIS HEAD. MEANWHILE

I COOLLY CRACK THE EGG OF A FINE LEGHORN CHICKEN.

YOUR EYES FILM. YOU TURN FROM ME AND LOOK ACROSS

THE ROOFTOPS AT THE SEA. EVEN THE FLIES ARE STILL.

I CRACK THE OTHER EGG.

SURELY WE HAVE DIMINISHED ONE ANOTHER.


O MY SOUL DO NOT ASPIRE TO
IMMORTAL LIFE BUT EXHAUST THE LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE.
—PINDAR PYTHIAN III

THERE IS BUT ONE TRULY SERIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM AND THAT IS SUICIDE. JUDGING WHETHER LIFE IS OR IS NOT WORTH LIVING AMOUNTS TO ANSWERING THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF PHILOSOPHY. ALL THE REST—WHETHER OR NOT THE WORLD HAS THREE DIMENSIONS WHETHER THE MIND HAS NINE OR TWELVE CATEGORIES—COMES AFTERWARDS. THESE ARE GAMES; ONE MUST FIRST ANSWER. AND IF IT IS TRUE AS NIETZSCHE CLAIMS THAT A PHILOSOPHER TO DESERVE OUR RESPECT MUST PREACH BY EXAMPLE YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT REPLY FOR IT WILL PRECEDE THE DEFINITIVE ACT. THESE ARE FACTS THE HEART CAN FEEL; YET THEY CALL FOR CAREFUL STUDY BEFORE THEY BECOME CLEAR TO THE INTELLECT.
    IF I ASK MYSELF HOW TO JUDGE THAT THIS QUESTION IS MORE URGENT THAN THAT I REPLY THAT ONE JUDGES BY THE ACTIONS IT ENTAILS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE DIE FOR THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT. GALILEO WHO HELD A SCIENTIFIC TRUTH OF GREAT IMPORTANCE ABJURED IT WITH THE GREATEST EASE AS SOON AS IT ENDANGERED HIS LIFE. IN A CERTAIN SENSE HE DID RIGHT.[1] THAT TRUTH WAS NOT WORTH THE STAKE. WHETHER THE EARTH OR THE SUN REVOLVES AROUND THE OTHER IS A MATTER OF PROFOUND INDIFFERENCE. TO TELL THE TRUTH IT IS A FUTILE QUESTION. ON THE OTHER HAND I SEE MANY PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE THEY JUDGE THAT LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING. I SEE OTHERS PARADOXICALLY GETTING KILLED FOR THE IDEAS OR ILLUSIONS THAT GIVE THEM A REASON FOR LIVING (WHAT IS CALLED A REASON FOR LIVING IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR DYING). I THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE MEANING OF LIFE IS THE MOST URGENT OF QUESTIONS. HOW TO ANSWER IT? ON ALL ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS (I MEAN THEREBY THOSE THAT RUN THE RISK OF LEADING TO DEATH OR THOSE THAT INTENSIFY THE PASSION OF LIVING) THERE ARE PROBABLY BUT TWO METHODS OF THOUGHT: THE METHOD OF LA PALISSE AND THE METHOD OF DON QUIXOTE. SOLELY THE BALANCE BETWEEN EVIDENCE AND LYRICISM CAN ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE SIMULTANEOUSLY EMOTION AND LUCIDITY. IN A SUBJECT AT ONCE SO HUMBLE AND SO HEAVY WITH EMOTION THE LEARNED AND CLASSICAL DIALECTIC MUST YIELD ONE CAN SEE TO A MORE MODEST ATTITUDE OF MIND DERIVING AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME FROM COMMON SENSE AND UNDERSTANDING.
    SUICIDE HAS NEVER BEEN DEALT WITH EXCEPT AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON. ON THE CONTRARY WE ARE CONCERNED HERE AT THE OUTSET WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT AND SUICIDE. AN ACT LIKE THIS IS PREPARED WITHIN THE SILENCE OF THE HEART AS IS A GREAT WORK OF ART. THE MAN HIMSELF IS IGNORANT OF IT. ONE EVENING HE PULLS THE TRIGGER OR JUMPS. OF AN APARTMENT-BUILDING MANAGER WHO HAD KILLED HIMSELF I WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD LOST HIS DAUGHTER FIVE YEARS BEFORE THAT BE BAD CHANGED GREATLY SINCE AND THAT THAT EXPERIENCE HAD “UNDERMINED” HIM. A MORE EXACT WORD CANNOT BE IMAGINED. BEGINNING TO THINK IS BEGINNING TO BE UNDERMINED. SOCIETY HAS BUT LITTLE CONNECTION WITH SUCH BEGINNINGS. THE WORM IS IN MAN’S HEART. THAT IS WHERE IT MUST BE SOUGHT. ONE MUST FOLLOW AND UNDERSTAND THIS FATAL GAME THAT LEADS FROM LUCIDITY IN THE FACE OF EXISTENCE TO FLIGHT FROM LIGHT.
    THERE ARE MANY CAUSES FOR A SUICIDE AND GENERALLY THE MOST OBVIOUS ONES WERE NOT THE MOST POWERFUL. RARELY IS SUICIDE COMMITTED (YET THE HYPOTHESIS IS NOT EXCLUDED) THROUGH REFLECTION. WHAT SETS OFF THE CRISIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNVERIFIABLE. NEWSPAPERS OFTEN SPEAK OF “PERSONAL SORROWS” OR OF “INCURABLE ILLNESS.” THESE EXPLANATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE. BUT ONE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WHETHER A FRIEND OF THE DESPERATE MAN HAD NOT THAT VERY DAY ADDRESSED HIM INDIFFERENTLY. HE IS THE GUILTY ONE. FOR THAT IS ENOUGH TO PRECIPITATE ALL THE RANCORS AND ALL THE BOREDOM STILL IN SUSPENSION.[2]
    BUT IF IT IS HARD TO FIX THE PRECISE INSTANT THE SUBTLE STEP WHEN THE MIND OPTED FOR DEATH IT IS EASIER TO DEDUCE FROM THE ACT ITSELF THE CONSEQUENCES IT IMPLIES. IN A SENSE AND AS IN MELODRAMA KILLING YOURSELF AMOUNTS TO CONFESSING. IT IS CONFESSING THAT LIFE IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU OR THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. LET’S NOT GO TOO FAR IN SUCH ANALOGIES HOWEVER BUT RATHER RETURN TO EVERYDAY WORDS. IT IS MERELY CONFESSING THAT THAT “IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE.” LIVING NATURALLY IS NEVER EASY. YOU CONTINUE MAKING THE GESTURES COMMANDED BY EXISTENCE FOR MANY REASONS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS HABIT. DYING VOLUNTARILY IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE RECOGNIZED EVEN INSTINCTIVELY THE RIDICULOUS CHARACTER OF THAT HABIT THE ABSENCE OF ANY PROFOUND REASON FOR LIVING THE INSANE CHARACTER OF THAT DAILY AGITATION AND THE USELESSNESS OF SUFFERING.
    WHAT THEN IS THAT INCALCULABLE FEELING THAT DEPRIVES THE MIND OF THE SLEEP NECESSARY TO LIFE? A WORLD THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED EVEN WITH BAD REASONS IS A FAMILIAR WORLD. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IN A UNIVERSE SUDDENLY DIVESTED OF ILLUSIONS AND LIGHTS MAN FEELS AN ALIEN A STRANGER. HIS EXILE IS WITHOUT REMEDY SINCE HE IS DEPRIVED OF THE MEMORY OF A LOST HOME OR THE HOPE OF A PROMISED LAND. THIS DIVORCE BETWEEN MAN AND THIS LIFE THE ACTOR AND HIS SETTING IS PROPERLY THE FEELING OF ABSURDITY. ALL HEALTHY MEN HAVING THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN SUICIDE IT CAN BE SEEN WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS FEELING AND THE LONGING FOR DEATH.
    THE SUBJECT OF THIS ESSAY IS PRECISELY THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ABSURD AND SUICIDE THE EXACT DEGREE TO WHICH SUICIDE IS A SOLUTION TO THE ABSURD. THE PRINCIPLE CAN BE ESTABLISHED THAT FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT CHEAT WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE MUST DETERMINE HIS ACTION. BELIEF IN THE ABSURDITY OF EXISTENCE MUST THEN DICTATE HIS CONDUCT. IT IS LEGITIMATE TO WONDER CLEARLY AND WITHOUT FALSE PATHOS WHETHER A CONCLUSION OF THIS IMPORTANCE REQUIRES FORSAKING AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDITION. I AM SPEAKING OF COURSE OF MEN INCLINED TO BE IN HARMONY WITH THEMSELVES.
    STATED CLEARLY THIS PROBLEM MAY SEEM BOTH SIMPLE AND INSOLUBLE. BUT IT IS WRONGLY ASSUMED THAT SIMPLE QUESTIONS INVOLVE ANSWERS THAT ARE NO LESS SIMPLE AND THAT EVIDENCE IMPLIES EVIDENCE. A PRIORI AND REVERSING THE TERMS OF THE PROBLEM JUST AS ONE DOES OR DOES NOT KILL ONESELF IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE BUT TWO PHILOSOPHICAL SOLUTIONS EITHER YES OR NO. THIS WOULD BE TOO EASY. BUT ALLOWANCE MUST BE MADE FOR THOSE WHO WITHOUT CONCLUDING CONTINUE QUESTIONING. HERE I AM ONLY SLIGHTLY INDULGING IN IRONY: THIS IS THE MAJORITY. I NOTICE ALSO THAT THOSE WHO ANSWER “NO” ACT AS IF THEY THOUGHT “YES.” AS A MATTER OF FACT IF I ACCEPT THE NIETZSCHEAN CRITERION THEY THINK “YES” IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. ON THE OTHER HAND IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THOSE WHO COMMIT SUICIDE WERE ASSURED OF THE MEANING OF LIFE. THESE CONTRADICTIONS ARE CONSTANT. IT MAY EVEN BE SAID THAT THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN SO KEEN AS ON THIS POINT WHERE ON THE CONTRARY LOGIC SEEMS SO DESIRABLE. IT IS A COMMONPLACE TO COMPARE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES AND THE BEHAVIOR OF THOSE WHO PROFESS THEM. BUT IT MUST BE SAID THAT OF THE THINKERS WHO REFUSED A MEANING TO LIFE NONE EXCEPT KIRILOV WHO BELONGS TO LITERATURE PEREGRINOS WHO IS BORN OF LEGEND[3] AND JULES LEQUIER WHO BELONGS TO HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED HIS LOGIC TO THE POINT OF REFUSING THAT LIFE. SCHOPENHAUER IS OFTEN CITED AS A FIT SUBJECT FOR LAUGHTER BECAUSE HE PRAISED SUICIDE WHILE SEATED AT A WELL-SET TABLE. THIS IS NO SUBJECT FOR JOKING. THAT WAY OF NOT TAKING THE TRAGIC SERIOUSLY IS NOT SO GRIEVOUS BUT IT HELPS TO JUDGE A MAN.
    IN THE FACE OF SUCH CONTRADICTIONS AND OBSCURITIES MUST WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OPINION ONE HAS ABOUT LIFE AND THE ACT ONE COMMITS TO LEAVE IT? LET US NOT EXAGGERATE IN THIS DIRECTION. IN A MAN’S ATTACHMENT TO LIFE THERE IS SOMETHING STRONGER THAN ALL THE ILLS IN THE WORLD. THE BODY’S JUDGMENT IS AS GOOD AS THE MIND’S AND THE BODY SHRINKS FROM ANNIHILATION. WE GET INTO THE HABIT OF LIVING BEFORE ACQUIRING THE HABIT OF THINKING. IN THAT RACE WHICH DAILY HASTENS US TOWARD DEATH THE BODY MAINTAINS ITS IRREPARABLE LEAD. IN SHORT THE ESSENCE OF THAT CONTRADICTION LIES IN WHAT I SHALL CALL THE ACT OF ELUDING BECAUSE IT IS BOTH LESS AND MORE THAN DIVERSION IN THE PASCALIAN SENSE. ELUDING IS THE INVARIABLE GAME. THE TYPICAL ACT OF ELUDING THE FATAL EVASION THAT CONSTITUTES THE THIRD THEME OF THIS ESSAY IS HOPE. HOPE OF ANOTHER LIFE ONE MUST “DESERVE” OR TRICKERY OF THOSE WHO LIVE NOT FOR LIFE ITSELF BUT FOR SOME GREAT IDEA THAT WILL TRANSCEND IT REFINE IT GIVE IT A MEANING AND BETRAY IT.
    THUS EVERYTHING CONTRIBUTES TO SPREADING CONFUSION. HITHERTO AND IT HAS NOT BEEN WASTED EFFORT PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED ON WORDS AND PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT REFUSING TO GRANT A MEANING TO LIFE NECESSARILY LEADS TO DECLARING THAT IT IS NOT WORTH LIVING. IN TRUTH THERE IS NO NECESSARY COMMON MEASURE BETWEEN THESE TWO JUDGMENTS. ONE MERELY HAS TO REFUSE TO HE MISLED BY THE CONFUSIONS DIVORCES AND INCONSISTENCIES PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT. ONE MUST BRUSH EVERYTHING ASIDE AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE REAL PROBLEM. ONE KILLS ONESELF BECAUSE LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING THAT IS CERTAINLY A TRUTH YET AN UNFRUITFUL ONE BECAUSE IT IS A TRUISM. BUT DOES THAT INSULT TO EXISTENCE THAT FLAT DENIAL IN WHICH IT IS PLUNGED COME FROM THE FACT THAT IT HAS NO MEANING? DOES ITS ABSURDITY REQUIRE ONE TO ESCAPE IT THROUGH HOPE OR SUICIDE—THIS IS WHAT MUST BE CLARIFIED HUNTED DOWN AND ELUCIDATED WHILE BRUSHING ASIDE ALL THE REST. DOES THE ABSURD DICTATE DEATH? THIS PROBLEM MUST BE GIVEN PRIORITY OVER OTHERS OUTSIDE ALL METHODS OF THOUGHT AND ALL EXERCISES OF THE DISINTERESTED MIND. SHADES OF MEANING CONTRADICTIONS THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT AN “OBJECTIVE” MIND CAN ALWAYS INTRODUCE INTO ALL PROBLEMS HAVE NO PLACE IN THIS PURSUIT AND THIS PASSION. IT CALLS SIMPLY FOR AN UNJUST—IN OTHER WORDS LOGICAL— THOUGHT. THAT IS NOT EASY. IT IS ALWAYS EASY TO BE LOGICAL. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE LOGICAL TO THE BITTER END. MEN WHO DIE BY THEIR OWN HAND CONSEQUENTLY FOLLOW TO ITS CONCLUSION THEIR EMOTIONAL INCLINATION. REFLECTION ON SUICIDE GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE ONLY PROBLEM TO INTEREST ME: IS THERE A LOGIC TO THE POINT OF DEATH? I CANNOT KNOW UNLESS I PURSUE WITHOUT RECKLESS PASSION IN THE SOLE LIGHT OF EVIDENCE THE REASONING OF WHICH I AM HERE SUGGESTING THE SOURCE. THIS IS WHAT I CALL AN ABSURD REASONING. MANY HAVE BEGUN IT. I DO NOT YET KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY KEPT TO IT.
    WHEN KARL JASPERS REVEALING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONSTITUTING THE WORLD AS A UNITY EXCLAIMS: “THIS LIMITATION LEADS ME TO MYSELF WHERE I CAN NO LONGER WITHDRAW BEHIND AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW THAT I AM MERELY REPRESENTING WHERE NEITHER I MYSELF NOR THE EXISTENCE OF OTHERS CAN ANY LONGER BECOME AN OBJECT FOR ME” HE IS EVOKING AFTER MANY OTHERS THOSE WATERLESS DESERTS WHERE THOUGHT REACHES ITS CONFINES. AFTER MANY OTHERS YES INDEED BUT HOW EAGER THEY WERE TO GET OUT OF THEM! AT THAT LAST CROSSROAD WHERE THOUGHT HESITATES MANY MEN HAVE ARRIVED AND EVEN SOME OF THE HUMBLEST. THEY THEN ABDICATED WHAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO THEM THEIR LIFE. OTHERS PRINCES OF THE MIND ABDICATED LIKEWISE BUT THEY INITIATED THE SUICIDE OF THEIR THOUGHT IN ITS PUREST REVOLT. THE REAL EFFORT IS TO STAY THERE RATHER IN SO FAR AS THAT IS POSSIBLE AND TO EXAMINE CLOSELY THE ODD VEGETATION OF THOSE DISTANT REGIONS. TENACITY AND ACUMEN ARE PRIVILEGED SPECTATORS OF THIS INHUMAN SHOW IN WHICH ABSURDITY HOPE AND DEATH CARRY ON THEIR DIALOGUE. THE MIND CAN THEN ANALYZE THE FIGURES OF THAT ELEMENTARY YET SUBTLE DANCE BEFORE ILLUSTRATING THEM AND RELIVING THEM ITSELF.

ABSURD WALLS
    LIKE GREAT WORKS DEEP FEELINGS ALWAYS MEAN MORE THAN THEY ARE CONSCIOUS OF SAYING. THE REGULARITY OF AN IMPULSE OR A REPULSION IN A SOUL IS ENCOUNTERED AGAIN IN HABITS OF DOING OR THINKING IS REPRODUCED IN CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE SOUL ITSELF KNOWS NOTHING. GREAT FEELINGS TAKE WITH THEM THEIR OWN UNIVERSE SPLENDID OR ABJECT. THEY LIGHT UP WITH THEIR PASSION AN EXCLUSIVE WORLD IN WHICH THEY RECOGNIZE THEIR CLIMATE. THERE IS A UNIVERSE OF JEALOUSY OF AMBITION OF SELFISHNESS OR OF GENEROSITY. A UNIVERSE IN OTHERWORDS A METAPHYSIC AND AN ATTITUDE OF MIND. WHAT IS TRUE OF ALREADY SPECIALIZED FEELINGS WILL BE EVEN MORE SO OF EMOTIONS BASICALLY AS INDETERMINATE SIMULTANEOUSLY AS VAGUE AND AS “DEFINITE” AS REMOTE AND AS “PRESENT” AS THOSE FURNISHED US BY BEAUTY OR AROUSED BY ABSURDITY.
    AT ANY STREETCORNER THE FEELING OF ABSURDITY CAN STRIKE ANY MAN IN THE FACE. AS IT IS IN ITS DISTRESSING NUDITY IN ITS LIGHT WITHOUT EFFULGENCE IT IS ELUSIVE. BUT THAT VERY DIFFICULTY DESERVES REFLECTION. IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT A MAN REMAINS FOREVER UNKNOWN TO US AND THAT THERE IS IN HIM SOMETHING IRREDUCIBLE THAT ESCAPES US. BUT PRACTICALLY I KNOW MEN AND RECOGNIZE THEM BY THEIR BEHAVIOR BY THE TOTALITY OF THEIR DEEDS BY THE CONSEQUENCES CAUSED IN LIFE BY THEIR PRESENCE. LIKEWISE ALL THOSE IRRATIONAL FEELINGS WHICH OFFER NO PURCHASE TO ANALYSIS. I CAN DEFINE THEM PRACTICALLY APPRECIATE THEM PRACTICALLY BY GATHERING TOGETHER THE SUM OF THEIR CONSEQUENCES IN THE DOMAIN OF THE INTELLIGENCE BY SEIZING AND NOTING ALL THEIR ASPECTS BY OUTLINING THEIR UNIVERSE. IT IS CERTAIN THAT APPARENTLY THOUGH I HAVE SEEN THE SAME ACTOR A HUNDRED TIMES I SHALL NOT FOR THAT REASON KNOW HIM ANY BETTER PERSONALLY. YET IF I ADD UP THE HEROES HE HAS PERSONIFIED AND IF I SAY THAT I KNOW HIM A LITTLE BETTER AT THE HUNDREDTH CHARACTER COUNTED OFF THIS WILL BE FELT TO CONTAIN AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH. FOR THIS APPARENT PARADOX IS ALSO AN APOLOGUE. THERE IS A MORAL TO IT. IT TEACHES THAT A MAN DEFINES HIMSELF BY HIS MAKE-BELIEVE AS WELL AS BY HIS SINCERE IMPULSES. THERE IS THUS A LOWER KEY OF FEELINGS INACCESSIBLE IN THE HEART BUT PARTIALLY DISCLOSED BY THE ACTS THEY IMPLY AND THE ATTITUDES OF MIND THEY ASSUME. IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THIS WAY I AM DEFINING A METHOD. BUT IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THAT METHOD IS ONE OF ANALYSIS AND NOT OF KNOWLEDGE. FOR METHODS IMPLY METAPHYSICS; UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY DISCLOSE CONCLUSIONS THAT THEY OFTEN CLAIM NOT TO KNOW YET. SIMILARLY THE LAST PAGES OF A BOOK ARE ALREADY CONTAINED IN THE FIRST PAGES. SUCH A LINK IS INEVITABLE. THE METHOD DEFINED HERE ACKNOWLEDGES THE FEELING THAT ALL TRUE KNOWLEDGE IS IMPOSSIBLE. SOLELY APPEARANCES CAN BE ENUMERATED AND THE CLIMATE MAKE ITSELF FELT.
    PERHAPS WE SHALL BE ABLE TO OVERTAKE THAT ELUSIVE FEELING OF ABSURDITY IN THE DIFFERENT BUT CLOSELY RELATED WORLDS OF INTELLIGENCE OF THE ART OF LIVING OR OF ART ITSELF. THE CLIMATE OF ABSURDITY IS IN THE BEGINNING. THE END IS THE ABSURD UNIVERSE AND THAT ATTITUDE OF MIND WHICH LIGHTS THE WORLD WITH ITS TRUE COLORS TO BRING OUT THE PRIVILEGED AND IMPLACABLE VISAGE WHICH THAT ATTITUDE HAS DISCERNED IN IT.

* * *
    ALL GREAT DEEDS AND ALL GREAT THOUGHTS HAVE A RIDICULOUS BEGINNING. GREAT WORKS ARE OFTEN BORN ON A STREET-CORNER OR IN A RESTAURANT’S REVOLVING DOOR. SO IT IS WITH ABSURDITY. THE ABSURD WORLD MORE THAN OTHERS DERIVES ITS NOBILITY FROM THAT ABJECT BIRTH. IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS REPLYING “NOTHING” WHEN ASKED WHAT ONE IS THINKING ABOUT MAY BE PRETENSE IN A MAN. THOSE WHO ARE LOVED ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS. BUT IF THAT REPLY IS SINCERE IF IT SYMBOLIZES THAT ODD STATE OF SOUL IN WHICH THE VOID BE-COMES ELOQUENT IN WHICH THE CHAIN OF DAILY GESTURES IS BROKEN IN WHICH THE HEART VAINLY SEEKS THE LINK THAT WILL CONNECT IT AGAIN THEN IT IS AS IT WERE THE FIRST SIGN OF ABSURDITY.
    IT HAPPENS THAT THE STAGE SETS COLLAPSE. RISING STREETCAR FOUR HOURS IN THE OFFICE OR THE FACTORY MEAL STREETCAR FOUR HOURS OF WORK MEAL SLEEP AND MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY ACCORDING TO THE SAME RHYTHM—THIS PATH IS EASILY FOLLOWED MOST OF THE TIME. BUT ONE DAY THE “WHY” ARISES AND EVERYTHING BEGINS IN THAT WEARINESS TINGED WITH AMAZEMENT. “BEGINS”—THIS IS IMPORTANT. WEARINESS COMES AT THE END OF THE ACTS OF A MECHANICAL LIFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT INAUGURATES THE IMPULSE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. IT AWAKENS CONSCIOUSNESS AND PROVOKES WHAT FOLLOWS. WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE GRADUAL RETURN INTO THE CHAIN OR IT IS THE DEFINITIVE AWAKENING. AT THE END OF THE AWAKENING COMES IN TIME THE CONSEQUENCE: SUICIDE OR RECOVERY. IN ITSELF WEARINESS HAS SOMETHING SICKENING ABOUT IT. HERE I MUST CONCLUDE THAT IT IS GOOD. FOR EVERYTHING BE-GINS WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND NOTHING IS WORTH ANYTHING EXCEPT THROUGH IT. THERE IS NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT THESE REMARKS. BUT THEY ARE OBVIOUS; THAT IS ENOUGH FOR A WHILE DURING A SKETCHY RECONNAISSANCE IN THE ORIGINS OF THE ABSURD. MERE “ANXIETY” AS HEIDEGGER SAYS IS AT THE SOURCE OF EVERYTHING.
    LIKEWISE AND DURING EVERY DAY OF AN UNILLUSTRIOUS LIFE TIME CARRIES US. BUT A MOMENT ALWAYS COMES WHEN WE HAVE TO CARRY IT. WE LIVE ON THE FUTURE: “TOMORROW” “LATER ON” “WHEN YOU HAVE MADE YOUR WAY” “YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH.” SUCH IRRELEVANCIES ARE WONDERFUL FOR AFTER ALL IT’S A MATTER OF DYING. YET A DAY COMES WHEN A MAN NOTICES OR SAYS THAT HE IS THIRTY. THUS HE ASSERTS HIS YOUTH. BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY HE SITUATES HIMSELF IN RELATION TO TIME. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN IT. HE ADMITS THAT HE STANDS AT A CERTAIN POINT ON A CURVE THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HAVING TO TRAVEL TO ITS END. HE BELONGS TO TIME AND BY THE HORROR THAT SEIZES HIM HE RECOGNIZES HIS WORST ENEMY. TOMORROW HE WAS LONGING FOR TOMORROW WHEREAS EVERYTHING IN HIM OUGHT TO REJECT IT. THAT REVOLT OF THE FLESH IS THE ABSURD.[4]
    A STEP LOWER AND STRANGENESS CREEPS IN: PERCEIVING THAT THE WORLD IS “DENSE” SENSING TO WHAT A DEGREE A STONE IS FOREIGN AND IRREDUCIBLE TO US WITH WHAT INTENSITY NATURE OR A LANDSCAPE CAN NEGATE US. AT THE HEART OF ALL BEAUTY LIES SOMETHING INHUMAN AND THESE HILLS THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE OUTLINE OF THESE TREES AT THIS VERY MINUTE LOSE THE ILLUSORY MEANING WITH WHICH WE HAD CLOTHED THEM HENCEFORTH MORE REMOTE THAN A LOST PARADISE. THE PRIMITIVE HOSTILITY OF THE WORLD RISES UP TO FACE US ACROSS MILLENNIA FOR A SECOND WE CEASE TO UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE FOR CENTURIES WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD IN IT SOLELY THE IMAGES AND DESIGNS THAT WE HAD AT- TRIBUTED TO IT BEFOREHAND BECAUSE HENCEFORTH WE LACK THE POWER TO MAKE USE OF THAT ARTIFICE. THE WORLD EVADES US BECAUSE IT BECOMES ITSELF AGAIN. THAT STAGE SCENERY MASKED BY HABIT BECOMES AGAIN WHAT IT IS. IT WITHDRAWS AT A DISTANCE FROM US. JUST AS THERE ARE DAYS WHEN UNDER THE FAMILIAL FACE OF A WOMAN WE SEE AS A STRANGER HER WE HAD LOVED MONTHS OR YEARS AGO PERHAPS WE SHALL COME EVEN TO DESIRE WHAT SUDDENLY LEAVES US SO ALONE. BUT THE TIME HAS NOT YET COME. JUST ONE THING: THAT DENSENESS AND THAT STRANGENESS OF THE WORLD IS THE ABSURD.
    MEN TOO SECRETE THE INHUMAN. AT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF LUCIDITY THE MECHANICAL ASPECT OF THEIR GESTURES THEIR MEANINGLESS PANTOMIME MAKES SILLY EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS THEM. A MAN IS TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE BEHIND A GLASS PARTITION; YOU CANNOT HEAR HIM BUT YOU SEE HIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE DUMB SHOW: YOU WONDER WHY HE IS ALIVE. THIS DISCOMFORT IN THE FACE OF MAN’S OWN INHUMANITY THIS INCALCULABLE TUMBLE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF WHAT WE ARE THIS “NAUSEA” AS A WRITER OF TODAY CALLS IT IS ALSO THE ABSURD. LIKEWISE THE STRANGER WHO AT CERTAIN SECONDS COMES TO MEET US IN A MIRROR THE FAMILIAR AND YET ALARMING BROTHER WE ENCOUNTER IN OUR OWN PHOTOGRAPHS IS ALSO THE ABSURD.
    I COME AT LAST TO DEATH AND TO THE ATTITUDE WE HAVE TOWARD IT. ON THIS POINT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID AND IT IS ONLY PROPER TO AVOID PATHOS. YET ONE WILL NEVER BE SUFFICIENTLY SURPRISED THAT EVERYONE LIVES AS IF NO ONE “KNEW.” THIS IS BECAUSE IN REALITY THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE OF DEATH. PROPERLY SPEAKING NOTHING HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED BUT WHAT HAS BEEN LIVED AND MADE CONSCIOUS. HERE IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE TO SPEAK OF THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS’ DEATHS. IT IS A SUBSTITUTE AN ILLUSION AND IT NEVER QUITE CONVINCES US. THAT MELANCHOLY CONVENTION CANNOT BE PERSUASIVE. THE HORROR COMES IN REALITY FROM THE MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THE EVENT. IF TIME FRIGHTENS US THIS IS BECAUSE IT WORKS OUT THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION COMES AFTERWARD. ALL THE PRETTY SPEECHES ABOUT THE SOUL WILL HAVE THEIR CONTRARY CONVINCINGLY PROVED AT LEAST FOR A TIME. FROM THIS INERT BODY ON WHICH A SLAP MAKES NO MARK THE SOUL HAS DISAPPEARED. THIS ELEMENTARY AND DEFINITIVE ASPECT OF THE ADVENTURE CONSTITUTES THE ABSURD FEELING. UNDER THE FATAL LIGHTING OF THAT DESTINY ITS USELESSNESS BECOMES EVIDENT. NO CODE OF ETHICS AND NO EFFORT ARE JUSTIFIABLE A PRIORI IN THE FACE OF THE CRUEL MATHEMATICS THAT COMMAND OUR CONDITION.
    LET ME REPEAT: ALL THIS HAS BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER. I AM LIMITING MYSELF HERE TO MAKING A RAPID CLASSIFICATION AND TO POINTING OUT THESE OBVIOUS THEMES. THEY RUN THROUGH ALL LITERATURES AND ALL PHILOSOPHIES. EVERYDAY CONVERSATION FEEDS ON THEM. THERE IS NO QUESTION OF REINVENTING THEM. BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BE SURE OF THESE FACTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO QUESTION ONESELF SUBSEQUENTLY ON THE PRIMORDIAL QUESTION. I AM INTERESTED LET ME REPEAT AGAIN—NOT GO MUCH IN ABSURD DISCOVERIES AS IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES. IF ONE IS ASSURED OF THESE FACTS WHAT IS ONE TO CONCLUDE HOW FAR IS ONE TO GO TO ELUDE NOTHING? IS ONE TO DIE VOLUNTARILY OR TO HOPE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING? BEFOREHAND IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE THE SAME RAPID INVENTORY ON THE PLANE OF THE INTELLIGENCE.

* * *
    THE MIND’S FIRST STEP IS TO DISTINGUISH WHAT IS TRUE FROM WHAT IS FALSE. HOWEVER AS SOON AS THOUGHT REFLECTS ON ITSELF WHAT IT FIRST DISCOVERS IS A CONTRADICTION. USELESS TO STRIVE TO BE CONVINCING IN THIS CASE. OVER THE CENTURIES NO ONE HAS FURNISHED A CLEARER AND MORE ELEGANT DEMONSTRATION OF THE BUSINESS THAN ARISTOTLE: “THE OFTEN RIDICULED CONSEQUENCE OF THESE OPINIONS IS THAT THEY DESTROY THEMSELVES. FOR BY ASSERTING THAT ALL IS TRUE WE ASSERT THE TRUTH OF THE CONTRARY ASSERTION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE FALSITY OF OUR OWN THESIS (FOR THE CONTRARY ASSERTION DOES NOT ADMIT THAT IT CAN BE TRUE). AND IF ONE SAYS THAT ALL IS FALSE THAT ASSERTION IS ITSELF FALSE. IF WE DECLARE THAT SOLELY THE ASSERTION OPPOSED TO OURS IS FALSE OR ELSE THAT SOLELY OURS IS NOT FALSE WE ARE NEVERTHELESS FORCED TO ADMIT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TRUE OR FALSE JUDGMENTS. FOR THE ONE WHO EXPRESSES A TRUE ASSERTION PROCLAIMS SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT IT IS TRUE AND SO ON AD INFINITUM.”
    THIS VICIOUS CIRCLE IS BUT THE FIRST OF A SERIES IN WHICH THE MIND THAT STUDIES ITSELF GETS LOST IN A GIDDY WHIRLING. THE VERY SIMPLICITY OF THESE PARADOXES MAKES THEM IRREDUCIBLE. WHATEVER MAY BE THE PLAYS ON WORDS AND THE ACROBATICS OF LOGIC TO UNDERSTAND IS ABOVE ALL TO UNIFY. THE MIND’S DEEPEST DESIRE EVEN IN ITS MOST ELABORATE OPERATIONS PARALLELS MAN’S UNCONSCIOUS FEELING IN THE FACE OF HIS UNIVERSE: IT IS AN INSISTENCE UPON FAMILIARITY AN APPETITE FOR CLARITY. UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD FOR A MAN IS REDUCING IT TO THE HUMAN STAMPING IT WITH HIS SEAL. THE CAT’S UNIVERSE IS NOT THE UNIVERSE OF THE ANTHILL. THE TRUISM “ALL THOUGHT IS ANTHROPOMORPHIC” HAS NO OTHER MEANING. LIKEWISE THE MIND THAT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND REALITY CAN CONSIDER ITSELF SATISFIED ONLY BY REDUCING IT TO TERMS OF THOUGHT. IF MAN REALIZED THAT THE UNIVERSE LIKE HIM CAN LOVE AND SUFFER HE WOULD BE RECONCILED. IF THOUGHT DISCOVERED IN THE SHIMMERING MIRRORS OF PHENOMENA ETERNAL RELATIONS CAPABLE OF SUMMING THEM UP AND SUMMING THEMSELVES UP IN A SINGLE PRINCIPLE THEN WOULD BE SEEN AN INTELLECTUAL JOY OF WHICH THE MYTH OF THE BLESSED WOULD BE BUT A RIDICULOUS IMITATION. THAT NOSTALGIA FOR UNITY THAT APPETITE FOR THE ABSOLUTE ILLUSTRATES THE ESSENTIAL IMPULSE OF THE HUMAN DRAMA. BUT THE FACT OF THAT NOSTALGIA’S EXISTENCE DOES NOT IMPLY THAT IT IS TO BE IMMEDIATELY SATISFIED. FOR IF BRIDGING THE GULF THAT SEPARATES DESIRE FROM CONQUEST WE ASSERT WITH PARMENIDES THE REALITY OF THE ONE (WHATEVER IT MAY BE) WE FALL INTO THE RIDICULOUS CONTRADICTION OF A MIND THAT ASSERTS TOTAL UNITY AND PROVES BY ITS VERY ASSERTION ITS OWN DIFFERENCE AND THE DIVERSITY IT CLAIMED TO RESOLVE. THIS OTHER VICIOUS CIRCLE IS ENOUGH TO STIFLE OUR HOPES.
    THESE ARE AGAIN TRUISMS. I SHALL AGAIN REPEAT THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES BUT IN THE CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN BE DEDUCED FROM THEM. I KNOW ANOTHER TRUISM: IT TELLS ME THAT MAN IS MORTAL. ONE CAN NEVERTHELESS COUNT THE MINDS THAT HAVE DEDUCED THE EXTREME CONCLUSIONS FROM IT. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER AS A CONSTANT POINT OF REFERENCE IN THIS ESSAY THE REGULAR HIATUS BETWEEN WHAT WE FANCY WE KNOW AND WHAT WE REALLY KNOW PRACTICAL ASSENT AND SIMULATED IGNORANCE WHICH ALLOWS US TO LIVE WITH IDEAS WHICH IF WE TRULY PUT THEM TO THE TEST OUGHT TO UPSET OUR WHOLE LIFE. FACED WITH THIS INEXTRICABLE CONTRADICTION OF THE MIND WE SHALL FULLY GRASP THE DIVORCE SEPARATING US FROM OUR OWN CREATIONS. SO LONG AS THE MIND KEEPS SILENT IN THE MOTIONLESS WORLD OF ITS HOPES EVERYTHING IS REFLECTED AND ARRANGED IN THE UNITY OF ITS NOSTALGIA. BUT WITH ITS FIRST MOVE THIS WORLD CRACKS AND TUMBLES: AN INFINITE NUMBER OF SHIMMERING FRAGMENTS IS OFFERED TO THE UNDERSTANDING. WE MUST DESPAIR OF EVER RECONSTRUCTING THE FAMILIAR CALM SURFACE WHICH WOULD GIVE US PEACE OF HEART. AFTER SO MANY CENTURIES OF INQUIRIES SO MANY ABDICATIONS AMONG THINKERS WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PROFESSIONAL RATIONALISTS TODAY PEOPLE DESPAIR OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE. IF THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT HISTORY OF HUMAN THOUGHT WERE TO BE WRITTEN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE HISTORY OF ITS SUCCESSIVE REGRETS AND ITS IMPOTENCES.
    OF WHOM AND OF WHAT INDEED CAN I SAY: “I KNOW THAT!” THIS HEART WITHIN ME I CAN FEEL AND I JUDGE THAT IT EXISTS. THIS WORLD I CAN TOUCH AND I LIKEWISE JUDGE THAT IT EXISTS. THERE ENDS ALL MY KNOWLEDGE AND THE REST IS CONSTRUCTION. FOR IF I TRY TO SEIZE THIS SELF OF WHICH I FEEL SURE IF I TRY TO DEFINE AND TO SUMMARIZE IT IT IS NOTHING BUT WATER SLIPPING THROUGH MY FINGERS. I CAN SKETCH ONE BY ONE ALL THE ASPECTS IT IS ABLE TO ASSUME ALL THOSE LIKEWISE THAT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO IT THIS UPBRINGING THIS ORIGIN THIS ARDOR OR THESE SILENCES THIS NOBILITY OR THIS VILENESS. BUT ASPECTS CANNOT BE ADDED UP. THIS VERY HEART WHICH IS MINE WILL FOREVER REMAIN INDEFINABLE TO ME. BETWEEN THE CERTAINTY I HAVE OF MY EXISTENCE AND THE CONTENT I TRY TO GIVE TO THAT ASSURANCE THE GAP WILL NEVER BE FILLED. FOREVER I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO MYSELF. IN PSYCHOLOGY AS IN LOGIC THERE ARE TRUTHS BUT NO TRUTH. SOCRATES’”KNOW THYSELF” HAS AS MUCH VALUE AS THE “BE VIRTUOUS” OF OUR CONFESSIONALS. THEY REVEAL A NOSTALGIA AT THE SAME TIME AS AN IGNORANCE. THEY ARE STERILE EXERCISES ON GREAT SUBJECTS. THEY ARE LEGITIMATE ONLY IN PRECISELY SO FAR AS THEY ARE APPROXIMATE.
    AND HERE ARE TREES AND I KNOW THEIR GNARLED SURFACE WATER AND I FEEL ITS TASTE. THESE SCENTS OF GRASS AND STARS AT NIGHT CERTAIN EVENINGS WHEN THE HEART RELAXES—HOW SHALL I NEGATE THIS WORLD WHOSE POWER AND STRENGTH I FEEL? YET ALL THE KNOWLEDGE ON EARTH WILL GIVE ME NOTHING TO ASSURE ME THAT THIS WORLD IS MINE. YOU DESCRIBE IT TO ME AND YOU TEACH ME TO CLASSIFY IT. YOU ENUMERATE ITS LAWS AND IN MY THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE I ADMIT THAT THEY ARE TRUE. YOU TAKE APART ITS MECHANISM AND MY HOPE INCREASES. AT THE FINAL STAGE YOU TEACH ME THAT THIS WONDROUS AND MULTICOLORED UNIVERSE CAN BE REDUCED TO THE ATOM AND THAT THE ATOM ITSELF CAN BE REDUCED TO THE ELECTRON. ALL THIS IS GOOD AND I WAIT FOR YOU TO CONTINUE. BUT YOU TELL ME OF AN INVISIBLE PLANETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH ELECTRONS GRAVITATE AROUND A NUCLEUS. YOU EXPLAIN THIS WORLD TO ME WITH AN IMAGE. I REALIZE THEN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO POETRY: I SHALL NEVER KNOW. HAVE I THE TIME TO BECOME INDIGNANT? YOU HAVE ALREADY CHANGED THEORIES. SO THAT SCIENCE THAT WAS TO TEACH ME EVERYTHING ENDS UP IN A HYPOTHESIS THAT LUCIDITY FOUNDERS IN METAPHOR THAT UNCERTAINTY IS RESOLVED IN A WORK OF ART. WHAT NEED HAD I OF SO MANY EFFORTS? THE SOFT LINES OF THESE HILLS AND THE HAND OF EVENING ON THIS TROUBLED HEART TEACH ME MUCH MORE. I HAVE RETURNED TO MY BEGINNING. I REALIZE THAT IF THROUGH SCIENCE I CAN SEIZE PHENOMENA AND ENUMERATE THEM I CANNOT FOR ALL THAT APPREHEND THE WORLD. WERE I TO TRACE ITS ENTIRE RELIEF WITH MY FINGER I SHOULD NOT KNOW ANY MORE. AND YOU GIVE ME THE CHOICE BETWEEN A DESCRIPTION THAT IS SURE BUT THAT TEACHES ME NOTHING AND HYPOTHESES THAT CLAIM TO TEACH ME BUT THAT ARE NOT SURE. A STRANGER TO MYSELF AND TO THE WORLD ARMED SOLELY WITH A THOUGHT THAT NEGATES ITSELF AS SOON AS IT ASSERTS WHAT IS THIS CONDITION IN WHICH I CAN HAVE PEACE ONLY BY REFUSING TO KNOW AND TO LIVE IN WHICH THE APPETITE FOR CONQUEST BUMPS INTO WALLS THAT DEFY ITS ASSAULTS? TO WILL IS TO STIR UP PARADOXES. EVERYTHING IS ORDERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BRING INTO BEING THAT POISONED PEACE PRODUCED BY THOUGHTLESSNESS LACK OF HEART OR FATAL RENUNCIATIONS.
    HENCE THE INTELLIGENCE TOO TELLS ME IN ITS WAY THAT THIS WORLD IS ABSURD. ITS CONTRARY BLIND REASON MAY WELL CLAIM THAT ALL IS CLEAR; I WAS WAITING FOR PROOF AND LONGING FOR IT TO BE RIGHT. BUT DESPITE SO MANY PRETENTIOUS CENTURIES AND OVER THE HEADS OF SO MANY ELOQUENT AND PERSUASIVE MEN I KNOW THAT IS FALSE. ON THIS PLANE AT LEAST THERE IS NO HAPPINESS IF I CANNOT KNOW. THAT UNIVERSAL REASON PRACTICAL OR ETHICAL THAT DETERMINISM THOSE CATEGORIES THAT EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ARE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECENT MAN LAUGH. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MIND. THEY NEGATE ITS PROFOUND TRUTH WHICH IS TO BE ENCHAINED. IN THIS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND LIMITED UNIVERSE MAN’S FATE HENCEFORTH ASSUMES ITS MEANING. A HORDE OF IRRATIONALS HAS SPRUNG UP AND SURROUNDS HIM UNTIL HIS ULTIMATE END. IN HIS RECOVERED AND NOW STUDIED LUCIDITY THE FEELING OF THE ABSURD BECOMES CLEAR AND DEFINITE. I SAID THAT THE WORLD IS ABSURD BUT I WAS TOO HASTY. THIS WORLD IN ITSELF IS NOT REASONABLE THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID. BUT WHAT IS ABSURD IS THE CONFRONTATION OF THIS IRRATIONAL AND THE WILD LONGING FOR CLARITY WHOSE CALL ECHOES IN THE HUMAN HEART. THE ABSURD DEPENDS AS MUCH ON MAN AS ON THE WORLD. FOR THE MOMENT IT IS ALL THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER. IT BINDS THEM ONE TO THE OTHER AS ONLY HATRED CAN WELD TWO CREATURES TOGETHER. THIS IS ALL I CAN DISCERN CLEARLY IN THIS MEASURELESS UNIVERSE WHERE MY ADVENTURE TAKES PLACE. LET US PAUSE HERE. IF I HOLD TO BE TRUE THAT ABSURDITY THAT DETERMINES MY RELATIONSHIP WITH LIFE IF I BECOME THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH THAT SENTIMENT THAT SEIZES ME IN FACE OF THE WORLD’S SCENES WITH THAT LUCIDITY IMPOSED ON ME BY THE PURSUIT OF A SCIENCE I MUST SACRIFICE EVERYTHING TO THESE CERTAINTIES AND I MUST SEE THEM SQUARELY TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEM. ABOVE ALL I MUST ADAPT MY BEHAVIOR TO THEM AND PURSUE THEM IN ALL THEIR CONSEQUENCES. I AM SPEAKING HERE OF DECENCY. BUT I WANT TO KNOW BEFOREHAND IF THOUGHT CAN LIVE IN THOSE DESERTS.

* * *
    I ALREADY KNOW THAT THOUGHT HAS AT LEAST ENTERED THOSE DESERTS. THERE IT FOUND ITS BREAD. THERE IT REALIZED THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN FEEDING ON PHANTOMS. IT JUSTIFIED SOME OF THE MOST URGENT THEMES OF HUMAN REFLECTION.
    FROM THE MOMENT ABSURDITY IS RECOGNIZED IT BECOMES A PASSION THE MOST HARROWING OF ALL. BUT WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN LIVE WITH ONE’S PASSIONS WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN ACCEPT THEIR LAW WHICH IS TO BURN THE HEART THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY EXALT—THAT IS THE WHOLE QUESTION. IT IS NOT HOWEVER THE ONE WE SHALL ASK JUST YET. IT STANDS AT THE CENTER OF THIS EXPERIENCE. THERE WILL BE TIME TO COME BACK TO IT. LET US RECOGNIZE RATHER THOSE THEMES AND THOSE IMPULSES BORN OF THE DESERT. IT WILL SUFFICE TO ENUMERATE THEM. THEY TOO ARE KNOWN TO ALL TODAY. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MEN TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE IRRATIONAL. THE TRADITION OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED HUMILIATED THOUGHT HAS NEVER CEASED TO EXIST. THE CRITICISM OF RATIONALISM HAS BEEN MADE SO OFTEN THAT IT SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO BEGIN AGAIN. YET OUR EPOCH IS MARKED BY THE REBIRTH OF THOSE PARADOXICAL SYSTEMS THAT STRIVE TO TRIP UP THE REASON AS IF TRULY IT HAD ALWAYS FORGED AHEAD. BUT THAT IS NOT SO MUCH A PROOF OF THE EFFICACY OF THE REASON AS OF THE INTENSITY OF ITS HOPES. ON THE PLANE OF HISTORY SUCH A CONSTANCY OF TWO ATTITUDES ILLUSTRATES THE ESSENTIAL PASSION OF MAN TORN BETWEEN HIS URGE TOWARD UNITY AND THE CLEAR VISION HE MAY HAVE OF THE WALLS ENCLOSING HIM.
    BUT NEVER PERHAPS AT ANY TIME HAS THE ATTACK ON REASON BEEN MORE VIOLENT THAN IN OURS. SINCE ZARATHUSTRA’S GREAT OUTBURST: “BY CHANCE IT IS THE OLDEST NOBILITY IN THE WORLD. I CONFERRED IT UPON ALL THINGS WHEN I PROCLAIMED THAT ABOVE THEM NO ETERNAL WILL WAS EXERCISED” SINCE KIERKEGAARD’S FATAL ILLNESS “THAT MALADY THAT LEADS TO DEATH WITH NOTHING ELSE FOLLOWING IT” THE SIGNIFICANT AND TORMENTING THEMES OF ABSURD THOUGHT HAVE FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER. OR AT LEAST AND THIS PROVISO IS OF CAPITAL IMPORTANCE THE THEMES OF IRRATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS THOUGHT. FROM JASPERS TO HEIDEGGER FROM KIERKEGAARD TO CHE-STOV FROM THE PHENOMENOLOGISTS TO SCHELER ON THE LOGICAL PLANE AND ON THE MORAL PLANE A WHOLE FAMILY OF MINDS RELATED BY THEIR NOSTALGIA BUT OPPOSED BY THEIR METHODS OR THEIR AIMS HAVE PERSISTED IN BLOCKING THE ROYAL ROAD OF REASON AND IN RECOVERING THE DIRECT PATHS OF TRUTH. HERE I ASSUME THESE THOUGHTS TO BE KNOWN AND LIVED. WHATEVER MAY BE OR HAVE BEEN THEIR AMBITIONS ALL STARTED OUT FROM THAT INDESCRIBABLE UNIVERSE WHERE CONTRADICTION ANTINOMY ANGUISH OR IMPOTENCE REIGNS. AND WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS PRECISELY THE THEMES SO FAR DISCLOSED. FOR THEM TOO IT MUST BE SAID THAT WHAT MATTERS ABOVE ALL IS THE CONCLUSIONS THEY HAVE MANAGED TO DRAW FROM THOSE DISCOVERIES. THAT MATTERS SO MUCH THAT THEY MUST BE EXAMINED SEPARATELY. BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE CONCERNED SOLELY WITH THEIR DISCOVERIES AND THEIR INITIAL EXPERIMENTS. WE ARE CONCERNED SOLELY WITH NOTING THEIR AGREEMENT. IF IT WOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THEIR PHILOSOPHIES IT IS POSSIBLE AND SUFFICIENT IN ANY CASE TO BRING OUT THE CLIMATE THAT IS COMMON TO THEM.
    HEIDEGGER CONSIDERS THE HUMAN CONDITION COLDLY AND ANNOUNCES THAT THAT EXISTENCE IS HUMILIATED. THE ONLY REALITY IS “ANXIETY” IN THE WHOLE CHAIN OF BEINGS. TO THE MAN LOST IN THE WORLD AND ITS DIVERSIONS THIS ANXIETY IS A BRIEF FLEETING FEAR. BUT IF THAT FEAR BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF IT BECOMES ANGUISH THE PERPETUAL CLIMATE OF THE LUCID MAN “IN WHOM EXISTENCE IS CONCENTRATED.” THIS PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY WRITES WITHOUT TREMBLING AND IN THE MOST ABSTRACT LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD THAT “THE FINITE AND LIMITED CHARACTER OF HUMAN EXISTENCE IS MORE PRIMORDIAL THAN MAN HIMSELF.” HIS INTEREST IN KANT EXTENDS ONLY TO RECOGNIZING THE RESTRICTED CHARACTER OF HIS “PURE REASON.” THIS IS TO COINCIDE AT THE END OF HIS ANALYSES THAT “THE WORLD CAN NO LONGER OFFER ANYTHING TO THE MAN FILLED WITH ANGUISH.” THIS ANXIETY SEEMS TO HIM SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE CATEGORIES IN THE WORLD THAT HE THINKS AND TALKS ONLY OF IT. HE ENUMERATES ITS ASPECTS: BOREDOM WHEN THE ORDINARY MAN STRIVES TO QUASH IT IN HIM AND BENUMB IT; TERROR WHEN THE MIND CONTEMPLATES DEATH. HE TOO DOES NOT SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE ABSURD. THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH IS THE CALL OF ANXIETY AND “EXISTENCE THEN DELIVERS ITSELF ITS OWN SUMMONS THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF CONSCIOUSNESS.” IT IS THE VERY VOICE OF ANGUISH AND IT ADJURES EXISTENCE “TO RETURN FROM ITS LOSS IN THE ANONYMOUS THEY.” FOR HIM TOO ONE MUST NOT SLEEP BUT MUST KEEP ALERT UNTIL THE CONSUMMATION. HE STANDS IN THIS ABSURD WORLD AND POINTS OUT ITS EPHEMERAL CHARACTER. HE SEEKS HIS WAY AMID THESE RUINS.
    JASPERS DESPAIRS OF ANY ONTOLOGY BECAUSE HE CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE LOST “NAÏVETÉ.” HE KNOWS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE NOTHING THAT WILL TRANSCEND THE FATAL GAME OF APPEARANCES. HE KNOWS THAT THE END OF THE MIND IS FAILURE. HE TARRIES OVER THE SPIRITUAL ADVENTURES REVEALED BY HISTORY AND PITILESSLY DISCLOSES THE FLAW IN EACH SYSTEM THE ILLUSION THAT SAVED EVERYTHING THE PREACHING THAT HID NOTHING. IN THIS RAVAGED WORLD IN WHICH THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWLEDGE IS ESTABLISHED IN WHICH EVERLASTING NOTHINGNESS SEEMS THE ONLY REALITY AND IRREMEDIABLE DESPAIR SEEMS THE ONLY ATTITUDE HE TRIES TO RECOVER THE ARIADNE’S THREAD THAT LEADS TO DIVINE SECRETS.
    CHESTOV FOR HIS PART THROUGHOUT A WONDERFULLY MONOTONOUS WORK CONSTANTLY STRAINING TOWARD THE SAME TRUTHS TIRELESSLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE TIGHTEST SYSTEM THE MOST UNIVERSAL RATIONALISM ALWAYS STUMBLES EVENTUALLY ON THE IRRATIONAL OF HUMAN THOUGHT. NONE OF THE IRONIC FACTS OR RIDICULOUS CONTRADICTIONS THAT DEPRECIATE THE REASON ESCAPES HIM. ONE THING ONLY INTERESTS HIM AND THAT IS THE EXCEPTION WHETHER IN THE DOMAIN OF THE HEART OR OF THE MIND. THROUGH THE DOSTOEVSKIAN EXPERIENCES OF THE CONDEMNED MAN THE EXACERBATED ADVENTURES OF THE NIETZSCHEAN MIND HAMLET’S IMPRECATIONS OR THE BITTER ARISTOCRACY OF AN IBSEN HE TRACKS DOWN IL-LUMINATES AND MAGNIFIES THE HUMAN REVOLT AGAINST THE IRREMEDIABLE. HE REFUSES THE REASON ITS REASONS AND BEGINS TO ADVANCE WITH SOME DECISION ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT COLORLESS DESERT WHERE ALL CERTAINTIES HAVE BECOME STONES.
    OF ALL PERHAPS THE MOST ENGAGING KIERKEGAARD FOR A PART OF HIS EXISTENCE AT LEAST DOES MORE THAN DISCOVER THE ABSURD HE LIVES IT. THE MAN WHO WRITES: “THE SUREST OF STUBBORN SILENCES IS NOT TO HOLD ONE’S TONGUE BUT TO TALK” MAKES SURE IN THE BEGINNING THAT NO TRUTH IS ABSOLUTE OR CAN RENDER SATISFACTORY AN EXISTENCE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN ITSELF. DON JUAN OF THE UNDERSTANDING HE MULTIPLIES PSEUDONYMS AND CONTRADICTIONS WRITES HIS DISCOURSES OF EDIFICATION AT THE SAME TIME AS THAT MANUAL OF CYNICAL SPIRITUALISM THE DIARY OF THE SEDUCER. HE REFUSES CONSOLATIONS ETHICS RELIABLE PRINCIPLES. AS FOR THAT THORN HE FEELS IN HIS HEART HE IS CAREFUL NOT TO QUIET ITS PAIN. ON THE CONTRARY HE AWAKENS IT AND IN THE DESPERATE JOY OF A MAN CRUCIFIED AND HAPPY TO BE SO HE BUILDS UP PIECE BY PIECE—LUCIDITY REFUSAL MAKE BELIEVE—A CATEGORY OF THE MAN POSSESSED. THAT FACE BOTH TENDER AND SNEERING THOSE PIROUETTES FOLLOWED BY A CRY FROM THE HEART ARE THE ABSURD SPIRIT ITSELF GRAPPLING WITH A REALITY BEYOND ITS COMPREHENSION. AND THE SPIRITUAL ADVENTURE THAT LEADS KIERKEGAARD TO HIS BELOVED SCANDALS BEGINS LIKEWISE IN THE CHAOS OF AN EXPERIENCE DIVESTED OF ITS SETTING AND RELEGATED TO ITS ORIGINAL INCOHERENCE.
    ON QUITE A DIFFERENT PLANE THAT OF METHOD HUSSERL AND THE PHENOMENOLOGISTS BY THEIR VERY EXTRAVAGANCES REINSTATE THE WORLD IN ITS DIVERSITY AND DENY THE TRANSCENDENT POWER OF THE REASON. THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE BECOMES INCALCULABLY ENRICHED THROUGH THEM. THE ROSE PETAL THE MILESTONE OR THE HUMAN HAND ARE AS IMPORTANT AS LOVE DESIRE OR THE LAWS OF GRAVITY. THINKING CEASES TO BE UNIFYING OR MAKING A SEMBLANCE FAMILIAR IN THE GUISE OF A MAJOR PRINCIPLE. THINKING IS LEARNING ALL OVER AGAIN TO SEE TO BE ATTENTIVE TO FOCUS CONSCIOUSNESS; IT IS TURNING EVERY IDEA AND EVERY IMAGE IN THE MANNER OF PROUST INTO A PRIVILEGED MOMENT. WHAT JUSTIFIES THOUGHT IS ITS EXTREME CONSCIOUSNESS. THOUGH MORE POSITIVE THAN KIERKEGAARD’S OR CHESTOV’S HUSSERL’S MANNER OF PROCEEDING IN THE BEGINNING NEVERTHELESS NEGATES THE CLASSIC METHOD OF THE REASON DISAPPOINTS HOPE OPENS TO INTUITION AND TO THE HEART A WHOLE PROLIFERATION OF PHENOMENA THE WEALTH OF WHICH HAS ABOUT IT SOMETHING INHUMAN. THESE PATHS LEAD TO ALL SCIENCES OR TO NONE. THIS AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT IN THIS CASE THE MEANS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE END. ALL THAT IS INVOLVED IS “AN ATTITUDE FOR UNDERSTANDING” AND NOT A CONSOLATION. LET ME REPEAT: IN THE BEGINNING AT VERY LEAST.
    HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO FEEL THE BASIC RELATIONSHIP OF THESE MINDS! HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO SEE THAT THEY TAKE THEIR STAND AROUND A PRIVILEGED AND BITTER MOMENT IN WHICH HOPE HAS NO FURTHER PLACE? I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE EXPLAINED TO ME OR NOTHING. AND THE REASON IS IMPOTENT WHEN IT HEARS THIS CRY FROM THE HEART. THE MIND AROUSED BY THIS INSISTENCE SEEKS AND FINDS NOTHING BUT CONTRADICTIONS AND NONSENSE. WHAT I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND IS NONSENSE. THE WORLD IS PEOPLED WITH SUCH IRRATIONALS. THE WORLD ITSELF WHOSE SINGLE MEANING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS BUT A VAST IRRATIONAL. IF ONE COULD ONLY SAY JUST ONCE: “THIS IS CLEAR” ALL WOULD BE SAVED. BUT THESE MEN VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN PROCLAIMING THAT NOTHING IS CLEAR ALL IS CHAOS THAT ALL MAN HAS IS HIS LUCIDITY AND HIS DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WALLS SURROUNDING HIM.
    ALL THESE EXPERIENCES AGREE AND CONFIRM ONE ANOTHER. THE MIND WHEN IT REACHES ITS LIMITS MUST MAKE A JUDGMENT AND CHOOSE ITS CONCLUSIONS. THIS IS WHERE SUICIDE AND THE REPLY STAND. BUT I WISH TO REVERSE THE ORDER OF THE INQUIRY AND START OUT FROM THE INTELLIGENT ADVENTURE AND COME BACK TO DAILY ACTS. THE EXPERIENCES CALLED TO MIND HERE WERE BORN IN THE DESERT THAT WE MUST NOT LEAVE BEHIND. AT LEAST IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW HOW FAR THEY WENT. AT THIS POINT OF HIS EFFORT MAN STANDS FACE TO FACE WITH THE IRRATIONAL. HE FEELS WITHIN HIM HIS LONGING FOR HAPPINESS AND FOR REASON. THE ABSURD IS BORN OF THIS CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE HUMAN NEED AND THE UNREASONABLE SILENCE OF THE WORLD. THIS MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN. THIS MUST BE CLUNG TO BECAUSE THE WHOLE CONSEQUENCE OF A LIFE CAN DEPEND ON IT. THE IRRATIONAL THE HUMAN NOSTALGIA AND THE ABSURD THAT IS BORN OF THEIR ENCOUNTER—THESE ARE THE THREE CHARACTERS IN THE DRAMA THAT MUST NECESSARILY END WITH ALL THE LOGIC OF WHICH AN EXISTENCE IS CAPABLE.

PHILOSOPHICAL SUICIDE
    THE FEELING OF THE ABSURD IS NOT FOR ALL THAT THE NOTION OF THE ABSURD. IT LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR IT AND THAT IS ALL. IT IS NOT LIMITED TO THAT NOTION EXCEPT IN THE BRIEF MOMENT WHEN IT PASSES JUDGMENT ON THE UNIVERSE. SUBSEQUENTLY IT HAS A CHANCE OF GOING FURTHER. IT IS ALIVE; IN OTHER WORDS IT MUST DIE OR ELSE REVERBERATE. SO IT IS WITH THE THEMES WE HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER. BUT THERE AGAIN WHAT INTERESTS ME IS NOT WORKS OR MINDS CRITICISM OF WHICH WOULD CALL FOR ANOTHER FORM AND ANOTHER PLACE BUT THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT THEIR CONCLUSIONS HAVE IN COMMON. NEVER PERHAPS HAVE MINDS BEEN SO DIFFERENT. AND YET WE RECOGNIZE AS IDENTICAL THE SPIRITUAL LANDSCAPES IN WHICH THEY GET UNDER WAY. LIKEWISE DESPITE SUCH DISSIMILAR ZONES OF KNOWLEDGE THE CRY THAT TERMINATES THEIR ITINERARY RINGS OUT IN THE SAME WAY. IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE THINKERS WE HAVE JUST RECALLED HAVE A COMMON CLIMATE.
    TO SAY THAT THAT CLIMATE IS DEADLY SCARCELY AMOUNTS TO PLAYING ON WORDS. LIVING UNDER THAT STIFLING SKY FORCES ONE TO GET AWAY OR TO STAY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND OUT HOW PEOPLE GET AWAY IN THE FIRST CASE AND WHY PEOPLE STAY IN THE SECOND CASE. THIS IS HOW I DEFINE THE PROBLEM OF SUICIDE AND THE POSSIBLE INTEREST IN THE CONCLUSIONS OF EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
    BUT FIRST I WANT TO DETOUR FROM THE DIRECT PATH. UP TO NOW WE HAVE MANAGED TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THE ABSURD FROM THE OUTSIDE. ONE CAN HOWEVER WONDER HOW MUCH IS CLEAR IN THAT NOTION AND BY DIRECT ANALYSIS TRY TO DISCOVER ITS MEANING ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER THE CONSEQUENCES IT INVOLVES.
    IF I ACCUSE AN INNOCENT MAN OF A MONSTROUS CRIME IF I TELL A
VIRTUOUS MAN THAT HE HAS COVETED HIS OWN SISTER HE WILL REPLY THAT THIS IS ABSURD. HIS INDIGNATION HAS ITS COMICAL ASPECT. BUT IT ALSO HAS ITS FUNDAMENTAL REASON. THE VIRTUOUS MAN ILLUSTRATES BY THAT REPLY THE DEFINITIVE ANTINOMY EXISTING BETWEEN THE DEED I AM ATTRIBUTING TO HIM AND HIS LIFELONG PRINCIPLES. “IT’S ABSURD” MEANS “IT’S IMPOSSIBLE” BUT ALSO “IT’S CONTRADICTORY.” IF I SEE A MAN ARMED ONLY WITH A SWORD ATTACK A GROUP OF MACHINE GUNS I SHALL CONSIDER HIS ACT TO BE ABSURD. BUT IT IS SO SOLELY BY VIRTUE OF THE DISPROPORTION BETWEEN HIS INTENTION AND THE REALITY HE WILL ENCOUNTER OF THE CONTRADICTION I NOTICE BETWEEN HIS TRUE STRENGTH AND THE AIM HE HAS IN VIEW. LIKEWISE WE SHALL DEEM A VERDICT ABSURD WHEN WE CONTRAST IT WITH THE VERDICT THE FACTS APPARENTLY DICTATED. AND SIMILARLY A DEMONSTRATION BY THE ABSURD IS ACHIEVED BY COMPARING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A REASONING WITH THE LOGICAL REALITY ONE WANTS TO SET UP. IN ALL THESE CASES FROM THE SIMPLEST TO THE MOST COMPLEX THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ABSURDITY WILL BE IN DIRECT RATIO TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO TERMS OF MY COMPARISON. THERE ARE ABSURD MARRIAGES CHALLENGES RANCORS SILENCES WARS AND EVEN PEACE TREATIES. FOR EACH OF THEM THE ABSURDITY SPRINGS FROM A COMPARISON. I AM THUS JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT THE FEELING OF ABSURDITY DOES NOT SPRING FROM THE MERE SCRUTINY OF A FACT OR AN IMPRESSION BUT THAT IT BURSTS FROM THE COMPARISON BETWEEN A BARE FACT AND A CERTAIN REALITY BETWEEN AN ACTION AND THE WORLD THAT TRANSCENDS IT. THE ABSURD IS ESSENTIALLY A DIVORCE. IT LIES IN NEITHER OF THE ELEMENTS COMPARED; IT IS BORN OF THEIR CONFRONTATION.
    IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND ON THE PLANE OF INTELLIGENCE I CAN THEREFORE SAY THAT THE ABSURD IS NOT IN MAN (IF SUCH A METAPHOR COULD HAVE A MEANING) NOR IN THE WORLD BUT IN THEIR PRESENCE TOGETHER. FOR THE MOMENT IT IS THE ONLY BOND UNITING THEM. IF WISH TO LIMIT MYSELF TO FACTS I KNOW WHAT MAN WANTS I KNOW WHAT THE WORLD OFFERS HIM AND NOW I CAN SAY THAT I ALSO KNOW WHAT LINKS THEM. I HAVE NO NEED TO DIG DEEPER. A SINGLE CERTAINTY IS ENOUGH FOR THE SEEKER. HE SIMPLY HAS TO DERIVE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES FROM IT.
    THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE IS ALSO A RULE OF METHOD. THE ODD TRINITY BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THIS WAY IS CERTAINLY NOT A STARTLING DISCOVERY. BUT IT RESEMBLES THE DATA OF EXPERIENCE IN THAT IT IS BOTH INFINITELY SIMPLE AND INFINITELY COMPLICATED. ITS FIRST DISTINGUISHING FEATURE IN THIS REGARD IS THAT IT CANNOT BE DIVIDED. TO DESTROY ONE OF ITS TERMS IS TO DESTROY THE WHOLE. THERE CAN BE NO ABSURD OUTSIDE THE HUMAN MIND. THUS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE ABSURD ENDS WITH DEATH. BUT THERE CAN BE NO ABSURD OUTSIDE THIS WORLD EITHER. AND IT IS BY THIS ELEMENTARY CRITERION THAT I JUDGE THE NOTION OF THE ABSURD TO BE ESSENTIAL AND CONSIDER THAT IT CAN STAND AS THE FIRST OF MY TRUTHS. THE RULE OF METHOD ALLUDED TO ABOVE APPEARS HERE. IF I JUDGE THAT A THING IS TRUE I MUST PRESERVE IT. IF I ATTEMPT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AT LEAST I MUST NOT BY THAT VERY SOLUTION CONJURE AWAY ONE OF THE TERMS OF THE PROBLEM. FOR ME THE SOLE DATUM IS THE ABSURD. THE FIRST AND AFTER ALL THE ONLY CONDITION OF MY INQUIRY IS TO PRESERVE THE VERY THING THAT CRUSHES ME CONSEQUENTLY TO RESPECT WHAT I CONSIDER ESSENTIAL IN IT. I HAVE JUST DEFINED IT AS A CONFRONTATION AND AN UNCEASING STRUGGLE.
    AND CARRYING THIS ABSURD LOGIC TO ITS CONCLUSION I MUST ADMIT THAT THAT STRUGGLE IMPLIES A TOTAL ABSENCE OF HOPE (WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DESPAIR) A CONTINUAL REJECTION (WHICH MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RENUNCIATION) AND A CONSCIOUS DISSATISFACTION (WHICH MUST NOT BE COMPARED TO IMMATURE UNREST). EVERYTHING THAT DESTROYS CONJURES AWAY OR EXORCISES THESE REQUIREMENTS (AND TO BEGIN WITH CONSENT WHICH OVERTHROWS DIVORCE) RUINS THE ABSURD AND DEVALUATES THE ATTITUDE THAT MAY THEN BE PROPOSED. THE ABSURD HAS MEANING ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT IS NOT AGREED TO.

* * *
    THERE EXISTS AN OBVIOUS FACT THAT SEEMS UTTERLY MORAL: NAMELY THAT A MAN IS ALWAYS A PREY TO HIS TRUTHS. ONCE HE HAS ADMITTED THEM HE CANNOT FREE HIMSELF FROM THEM. ONE HAS TO PAY SOMETHING. A MAN WHO HAS BE-COME CONSCIOUS OF THE ABSURD IS FOREVER BOUND TO IT. A MAN DEVOID OF HOPE AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING SO HAS CEASED TO BELONG TO THE FUTURE. THAT IS NATURAL. BUT IT IS JUST AS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD STRIVE TO ESCAPE THE UNIVERSE OF WHICH HE IS THE CREATOR. ALL THE FOREGOING HAS SIGNIFICANCE ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS PARADOX. CERTAIN MEN STARTING FROM A CRITIQUE OF RATIONALISM HAVE ADMITTED THE ABSURD CLIMATE. NOTHING IS MORE INSTRUCTIVE IN THIS REGARD THAN TO SCRUTINIZE THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE ELABORATED THEIR CONSEQUENCES.
    NOW TO LIMIT MYSELF TO EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHIES I SEE THAT ALL OF THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION SUGGEST ESCAPE. THROUGH AN ODD REASONING STARTING OUT FROM THE ABSURD OVER THE RUINS OF REASON IN A CLOSED UNIVERSE LIMITED TO THE HUMAN THEY DEIFY WHAT CRUSHES THEM AND FIND REASON TO HOPE IN WHAT IMPOVERISHES THEM. THAT FORCED HOPE IS RELIGIOUS IN ALL OF THEM. IT DESERVES ATTENTION.
    I SHALL MERELY ANALYZE HERE AS EXAMPLES A FEW THEMES DEAR TO CHESTOV AND KIERKEGAARD. BUT JASPERS WILL PROVIDE US IN CARICATURAL FORM A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS ATTITUDE. AS A RESULT THE REST WILL BE CLEARER. HE IS LEFT POWERLESS TO REALIZE THE TRANSCENDENT INCAPABLE OF PLUMBING THE DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE AND CONSCIOUS OF THAT UNIVERSE UPSET BY FAILURE. WILL HE ADVANCE OR AT LEAST DRAW THE CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT FAILURE? HE CONTRIBUTES NOTHING NEW. HE HAS FOUND NOTHING IN EXPERIENCE BUT THE CONFESSION OF HIS OWN IMPOTENCE AND NO OCCASION TO INFER ANY SATISFACTORY PRINCIPLE. YET WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION AS HE SAYS TO HIMSELF HE SUDDENLY ASSERTS ALL AT ONCE THE TRANSCENDENT THE ESSENCE OF EXPERIENCE AND THE SUPERHUMAN SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE WHEN HE WRITES: “DOES NOT THE FAILURE REVEAL BEYOND ANY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION AND INTERPRETATION NOT THE ABSENCE BUT THE EXISTENCE OF TRANSCENDENCE?” THAT EXISTENCE WHICH SUDDENLY AND THROUGH A BLIND ACT OF HUMAN CONFIDENCE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING HE DEFINES AS “THE UNTHINKABLE UNITY OF THE GENERAL AND THE PARTICULAR.” THUS THE ABSURD BECOMES GOD (IN THE BROADEST MEANING OF THIS WORD) AND THAT INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND BECOMES THE EXISTENCE THAT ILLUMINATES EVERYTHING. NOTHING LOGICALLY PREPARES THIS REASONING. I CAN CALL IT A LEAP. AND PARA-DOXICALLY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD JASPERS’S INSISTENCE HIS INFINITE PATIENCE DEVOTED TO MAKING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE TRANSCENDENT IMPOSSIBLE TO REALIZE. FOR THE MORE FLEETING THAT APPROXIMATION IS THE MORE EMPTY THAT DEFINITION PROVES TO BE AND THE MORE REAL THAT TRANSCENDENT IS TO HIM; FOR THE PASSION HE DEVOTES TO ASSERTING IT IS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE GAP BETWEEN HIS POWERS OF EXPLANATION AND THE IRRATIONALITY OF THE WORLD AND OF EXPERIENCE. IT THUS APPEARS THAT THE MORE BITTERLY JASPERS DESTROYS THE REASON’S PRECONCEPTIONS THE MORE RADICALLY HE WILL EXPLAIN THE WORLD. THAT APOSTLE OF HUMILIATED THOUGHT WILL FIND AT THE VERY END OF HUMILIATION THE MEANS OF REGENERATING BEING TO ITS VERY DEPTH.
    MYSTICAL THOUGHT HAS FAMILIARIZED US WITH SUCH DEVICES. THEY ARE JUST AS LEGITIMATE AS ANY ATTITUDE OF MIND. BUT FOR THE MOMENT I AM ACTING AS IF I TOOK A CERTAIN PROBLEM SERIOUSLY. WITHOUT JUDGING BEFOREHAND THE GENERAL VALUE OF THIS ATTITUDE OR ITS EDUCATIVE POWER I MEAN SIMPLY TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT ANSWERS THE CONDITIONS I SET MYSELF WHETHER IT IS WORTHY OF THE CONFLICT THAT CONCERNS ME. THUS I RETURN TO CHESTOV. A COMMENTATOR RELATES A REMARK OF HIS THAT DESERVES INTEREST:
    “THE ONLY TRUE SOLUTION” HE SAID “IS PRECISELY WHERE HUMAN JUDGMENT SEES NO SOLUTION. OTHERWISE WHAT NEED WOULD WE HAVE OF GOD? WE TURN TOWARD GOD ONLY TO OBTAIN THE IMPOSSIBLE. AS FOR THE POSSIBLE MEN SUFFICE.” IF THERE IS A CHESTOVIAN PHILOSOPHY I CAN SAY THAT IT IS ALTOGETHER SUMMED UP IN THIS WAY. FOR WHEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS PASSIONATE ANALYSES CHESTOV DISCOVERS THE FUNDAMENTAL ABSURDITY OF ALL EXISTENCE HE DOES NOT SAY: “THIS IS THE ABSURD” BUT RATHER: “THIS IS GOD: WE MUST RELY ON HIM EVEN IF HE DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO ANY OF OUR RATIONAL CATEGORIES.” SO THAT CONFUSION MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE THE RUSSIAN PHILOSOPHER EVEN HINTS THAT THIS GOD IS PERHAPS FULL OF HATRED AND HATEFUL INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND CONTRADICTORY; BUT THE MORE HIDEOUS IS HIS FACE THE MORE HE ASSERTS HIS POWER. HIS GREATNESS IS HIS INCOHERENCE. HIS PROOF IS HIS INHUMANITY. ONE MUST SPRING INTO HIM AND BY THIS LEAP FREE ONESELF FROM RATIONAL ILLUSIONS. THUS FOR CHESTOV ACCEPTANCE OF THE ABSURD IS CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE ABSURD ITSELF. BEING AWARE OF IT AMOUNTS TO ACCEPTING IT AND THE WHOLE LOGICAL EFFORT OF HIS THOUGHT IS TO BRING IT OUT SO THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE TREMENDOUS HOPE IT INVOLVES MAY BURST FORTH. LET ME REPEAT THAT THIS ATTITUDE IS LEGITIMATE. BUT I AM PERSISTING HERE IN CONSIDERING A SINGLE PROBLEM AND ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES. I DO NOT HAVE TO EXAMINE THE EMOTION OF A THOUGHT OR OF AN ACT OF FAITH. I HAVE A WHOLE LIFETIME TO DO THAT. I KNOW THAT THE RATIONALIST FINDS CHESTOV’S ATTITUDE ANNOYING. BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT CHESTOV IS RIGHT RATHER THAN THE RATIONALIST AND I MERELY WANT TO KNOW IF HE REMAINS FAITHFUL TO THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE ABSURD.
    NOW IF IT IS ADMITTED THAT THE ABSURD IS THE CONTRARY OF HOPE IT IS SEEN THAT EXISTENTIAL THOUGHT FOR CHESTOV PRESUPPOSES THE ABSURD BUT PROVES IT ONLY TO DISPEL IT. SUCH SUBTLETY OF THOUGHT IS A CONJUROR’S EMOTIONAL TRICK. WHEN CHESTOV ELSEWHERE SETS HIS ABSURD IN OPPOSITION TO CURRENT MORALITY AND REASON HE CALLS IT TRUTH AND REDEMPTION. HENCE THERE IS BASICALLY IN THAT DEFINITION OF THE ABSURD AN APPROBATION THAT CHESTOV GRANTS IT. IF IT IS ADMITTED THAT ALL THE POWER OF THAT NOTION LIES IN THE WAY IT RUNS COUNTER TO OUR ELEMENTARY HOPES IF IT IS FELT THAT TO REMAIN THE ABSURD REQUIRES NOT TO BE CONSENTED TO THEN IT CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN THAT IT HAS LOST ITS TRUE ASPECT ITS HUMAN AND RELATIVE CHARACTER IN ORDER TO ENTER AN ETERNITY THAT IS BOTH INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND SATISFYING. IF THERE IS AN ABSURD IT IS IN MAN’S UNIVERSE. THE MOMENT THE NOTION TRANSFORMS ITSELF INTO ETERNITY’S SPRINGBOARD IT CEASES TO BE LINKED TO HUMAN LUCIDITY. THE ABSURD IS NO LONGER THAT EVIDENCE THAT MAN ASCERTAINS WITHOUT CONSENTING TO IT. THE STRUGGLE IS ELUDED. MAN INTEGRATES THE ABSURD AND IN THAT COMMUNION CAUSES TO DISAPPEAR ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTER WHICH IS OPPOSITION LACERATION AND DIVORCE. THIS LEAP IS AN ESCAPE. CHESTOV WHO IS SO FOND OF QUOTING HAMLET’S REMARK: “THE TIME IS OUT OF JOINT” WRITES IT DOWN WITH A SORT OF SAVAGE HOPE THAT SEEMS TO BELONG TO HIM IN PARTICULAR. FOR IT IS NOT IN THIS SENSE THAT HAMLET SAYS IT OR SHAKESPEARE WRITES IT. THE INTOXICATION OF THE IRRATIONAL AND THE VOCATION OF RAPTURE TURN A LUCID MIND AWAY FROM THE ABSURD. TO CHESTOV REASON IS USELESS BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BEYOND REASON. TO AN ABSURD MIND REASON IS USELESS AND THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND REASON.
    THIS LEAP CAN AT LEAST ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE MORE AS TO THE TRUE NATURE OF THE ABSURD. WE KNOW THAT IT IS WORTHLESS EXCEPT IN AN EQUILIBRIUM THAT IT IS ABOVE ALL IN THE COMPARISON AND NOT IN THE TERMS OF THAT COMPARISON. BUT IT SO HAPPENS THAT CHESTOV PUTS ALL THE EMPHASIS ON ONE OF THE TERMS AND DESTROYS THE EQUILIBRIUM. OUR APPETITE FOR UNDERSTANDING OUR NOSTALGIA FOR THE ABSOLUTE ARE EXPLICABLE ONLY IN SO FAR PRECISELY AS WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN MANY THINGS. IT IS USELESS TO NEGATE THE REASON ABSOLUTELY. IT HAS ITS ORDER IN WHICH IT IS EFFICACIOUS. IT IS PROPERLY THAT OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. WHENCE WE WANTED TO MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR. IF WE CANNOT DO SO IF THE ABSURD IS BORN ON THAT OCCASION IT IS BORN PRECISELY AT THE VERY MEETING-POINT OF THAT EFFICACIOUS BUT LIMITED REASON WITH THE EVER RESURGENT IRRATIONAL. NOW WHEN CHESTOV RISES UP AGAINST A HEGELIAN PROPOSITION SUCH AS “THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM TAKES PLACE IN CONFORMITY WITH IMMUTABLE LAWS AND THOSE LAWS ARE ITS REASON” WHEN HE DEVOTES ALL HIS PASSION TO UPSETTING SPINOZA’S RATIONALISM HE CONCLUDES IN EFFECT IN FAVOR OF THE VANITY OF ALL REASON. WHENCE BY A NATURAL AND ILLEGITIMATE REVERSAL TO THE PRE-EMINENCE OF THE IRRATIONAL.[5] BUT THE TRANSITION IS NOT EVIDENT. FOR HERE MAY INTERVENE THE NOTION OF LIMIT AND THE NOTION OF LEVEL. THE LAWS OF NATURE MAY BE OPERATIVE UP TO A CERTAIN LIMIT BEYOND WHICH THEY TURN AGAINST THEMSELVES TO GIVE BIRTH TO THE ABSURD. OR ELSE THEY MAY JUSTIFY THEMSELVES ON THE LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION WITHOUT FOR THAT REASON BEING TRUE ON THE LEVEL OF EXPLANATION.
    EVERYTHING IS SACRIFICED HERE TO THE IRRATIONAL AND THE DEMAND FOR CLARITY BEING CONJURED AWAY THE ABSURD DISAPPEARS WITH ONE OF THE TERMS OF ITS COMPARISON. THE ABSURD MAN ON THE OTHER HAND DOES NOT UNDERTAKE SUCH A LEVELING PROCESS. HE RECOGNIZES THE STRUGGLE DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY SCORN REASON AND ADMITS THE IRRATIONAL. THUS HE AGAIN EMBRACES IN A SINGLE GLANCE ALL THE DATA OF EXPERIENCE AND HE IS LITTLE INCLINED TO LEAP BEFORE KNOWING. HE KNOWS SIMPLY THAT IN THAT ALERT AWARENESS THERE IS NO FURTHER PLACE FOR HOPE.
    WHAT IS PERCEPTIBLE IN LEO CHESTOV WILL BE PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO IN KIERKEGAARD. TO BE SURE IT IS HARD TO OUTLINE CLEAR PROPOSITIONS IN SO ELUSIVE A WRITER. BUT DESPITE APPARENTLY OPPOSED WRITINGS BEYOND THE PSEUDONYMS THE TRICKS AND THE SMILES CAN BE FELT THROUGHOUT THAT WORK AS IT WERE THE PRESENTIMENT (AT THE SAME TIME AS THE APPREHENSION) OF A TRUTH WHICH EVENTUALLY BURSTS FORTH IN THE LAST WORKS: KIERKEGAARD LIKEWISE TAKES THE LEAP. HIS CHILDHOOD HAVING BEEN SO FRIGHTENED BY CHRISTIANITY HE ULTIMATELY RETURNS TO ITS HARSHEST ASPECT. FOR HIM TOO ANTINOMY AND PARADOX BECOME CRITERIA OF THE RELIGIOUS. THUS THE VERY THING THAT LED TO DESPAIR OF THE MEANING AND DEPTH OF THIS LIFE NOW GIVES IT ITS TRUTH AND ITS CLARITY. CHRISTIANITY IS THE SCANDAL AND WHAT KIERKEGAARD CALLS FOR QUITE PLAINLY IS THE THIRD SACRIFICE REQUIRED BY IGNATIUS LOYOLA THE ONE IN WHICH GOD MOST REJOICES: “THE SACRIFICE OF THE INTELLECT.” [6]
    THIS EFFECT OF THE “LEAP” IS ODD BUT MUST NOT SURPRISE US ANY LONGER. HE MAKES OF THE ABSURD THE CRITERION OF THE OTHER WORLD WHEREAS IT IS SIMPLY A RESIDUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS WORLD. “IN HIS FAILURE” SAYS KIERKEGAARD “THE BELIEVER FINDS HIS TRIUMPH.”
    IT IS NOT FOR ME TO WONDER TO WHAT STIRRING PREACHING THIS ATTITUDE IS LINKED. I MERELY HAVE TO WONDER IF THE SPECTACLE OF THE ABSURD AND ITS OWN CHARACTER JUSTIFIES IT. ON THIS POINT I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT SO. UPON CONSIDERING AGAIN THE CONTENT OF THE ABSURD ONE UNDERSTANDS BETTER THE METHOD THAT INSPIRED KIERKEGAARD. BETWEEN THE IRRATIONAL OF THE WORLD AND THE INSURGENT NOSTALGIA OF THE ABSURD HE DOES NOT MAINTAIN THE EQUILIBRIUM. HE DOES NOT RESPECT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT CONSTITUTES PROPERLY SPEAKING THE FEELING OF ABSURDITY. SURE OF BEING UNABLE TO ESCAPE THE IRRATIONAL HE WANTS AT LEAST TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM THAT DESPERATE NOSTALGIA THAT SEEMS TO HIM STERILE AND DEVOID OF IMPLICATION. BUT IF HE MAY BE RIGHT ON THIS POINT IN HIS JUDGMENT HE COULD NOT BE IN HIS NEGATION. IF HE SUBSTITUTES FOR HIS CRY OF REVOLT A FRANTIC ADHERENCE AT ONCE HE IS LED TO BLIND HIMSELF TO THE ABSURD WHICH HITHERTO ENLIGHTENED HIM AND TO DEIFY THE ONLY CERTAINTY HE HENCEFORTH POSSESSES THE IRRATIONAL. THE IMPORTANT THING AS ABBE GALIANI SAID TO MME D’EPINAY IS NOT TO BE CURED BUT TO LIVE WITH ONE’S AILMENTS. KIERKEGAARD WANTS TO BE CURED. TO BE CURED IS HIS FRENZIED WISH AND IT RUNS THROUGHOUT HIS WHOLE JOURNAL. THE ENTIRE EFFORT OF HIS INTELLIGENCE IS TO ESCAPE THE ANTINOMY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. AN ALL THE MORE DESPERATE EFFORT SINCE HE INTERMITTENTLY PERCEIVES ITS VANITY WHEN HE SPEAKS OF HIMSELF AS IF NEITHER FEAR OF GOD NOR PIETY WERE CAPABLE OF BRINGING HIM TO PEACE. THUS IT IS THAT THROUGH A STRAINED SUBTERFUGE HE GIVES THE IRRATIONAL THE APPEARANCE AND GOD THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE ABSURD: UNJUST INCOHERENT AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE. INTELLIGENCE ALONE IN HIM STRIVES TO STIFLE THE UNDERLYING DEMANDS OF THE HUMAN HEART. SINCE NOTHING IS PROVED EVERYTHING CAN BE PROVED.
    INDEED KIERKEGAARD HIMSELF SHOWS US THE PATH TAKEN. I DO NOT WANT TO SUGGEST ANYTHING HERE BUT HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO READ IN HIS WORKS THE SIGNS OF AN ALMOST INTENTIONAL MUTILATION OF THE SOUL TO BALANCE THE MUTILATION ACCEPTED IN REGARD TO THE ABSURD? IT IS THE LEITMOTIV OF THE JOURNAL. “WHAT I LACKED WAS THE ANIMAL WHICH ALSO BELONGS TO HUMAN DESTINY .... BUT GIVE ME A BODY THEN.” AND FURTHER ON: “OH! ESPECIALLY IN MY EARLY YOUTH WHAT SHOULD I NOT HAVE GIVEN TO BE A MAN EVEN FOR SIX MONTHS ... WHAT I LACK BASICALLY IS A BODY AND THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE.” ELSEWHERE THE SAME MAN NEVERTHELESS ADOPTS THE GREAT CRY OF HOPE THAT HAS COME DOWN THROUGH SO MANY CENTURIES AND QUICKENED SO MANY HEARTS EXCEPT THAT OF THE ABSURD MAN. “BUT FOR THE CHRISTIAN DEATH IS CERTAINLY NOT THE END OF EVERYTHING AND IT IMPLIES INFINITELY MORE HOPE THAN LIFE IMPLIES FOR US EVEN WHEN THAT LIFE IS OVERFLOWING WITH HEALTH AND VIGOR.” RECONCILIATION THROUGH SCANDAL IS STILL RECONCILIATION. IT ALLOWS ONE PERHAPS AS CAN BE SEEN TO DERIVE HOPE OF ITS CONTRARY WHICH IS DEATH. BUT EVEN IF FELLOW- FEELING INCLINES ONE TOWARD THAT ATTITUDE STILL IT MUST BE SAID THAT EXCESS JUSTIFIES NOTHING. THAT TRANSCENDS AS THE SAYING GOES THE HUMAN SCALE; THEREFORE IT MUST BE SUPERHUMAN. BUT THIS “THEREFORE” IS SUPERFLUOUS. THERE IS NO LOGICAL CERTAINTY HERE. THERE IS NO EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY EITHER. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IN FACT THAT TRANSCENDS MY SCALE. IF I DO NOT DRAW A NEGATION FROM IT AT LEAST I DO NOT WANT TO FOUND ANYTHING ON THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE. I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER I CAN LIVE WITH WHAT I KNOW AND WITH THAT ALONE. I AM TOLD AGAIN THAT HERE THE INTELLIGENCE MUST SACRIFICE ITS PRIDE AND THE REASON BOW DOWN. BUT IF I RECOGNIZE THE LIMITS OF THE REASON I DO NOT THEREFORE NEGATE IT RECOGNIZING ITS RELATIVE POWERS. I MERELY WANT TO REMAIN IN THIS MIDDLE PATH WHERE THE INTELLIGENCE CAN REMAIN CLEAR. IF THAT IS ITS PRIDE I SEE NO SUFFICIENT REASON FOR GIVING IT UP. NOTHING MORE PROFOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAN KIERKEGAARD’S VIEW ACCORDING TO WHICH DESPAIR IS NOT A FACT BUT A STATE: THE VERY STATE OF SIN. FOR SIN IS WHAT ALIENATES FROM GOD. THE ABSURD WHICH IS THE METAPHYSICAL STATE OF THE CONSCIOUS MAN DOES NOT LEAD TO GOD.[7] PERHAPS THIS NOTION WILL BECOME CLEARER IF I RISK THIS SHOCKING STATEMENT: THE ABSURD IS SIN WITHOUT GOD.
    IT IS A MATTER OF LIVING IN THAT STATE OF THE ABSURD I KNOW ON WHAT IT IS FOUNDED THIS MIND AND THIS WORLD STRAINING AGAINST EACH OTHER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EMBRACE EACH OTHER. I ASK FOR THE RULE— OF LIFE OF THAT STATE AND WHAT I AM OFFERED NEGLECTS ITS BASIS NEGATES ONE OF THE TERMS OF THE PAINFUL OPPOSITION DEMANDS OF ME A RESIGNATION. I ASK WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE CONDITION I RECOGNIZE AS MINE; I KNOW IT IMPLIES OBSCURITY AND IGNORANCE; AND I AM ASSURED THAT THIS IGNORANCE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING AND THAT THIS DARKNESS IS MY LIGHT. BUT THERE IS NO REPLY HERE TO MY INTENT AND THIS STIRRING LYRICISM CANNOT HIDE THE PARADOX FROM ME. ONE MUST THEREFORE TURN AWAY. KIERKEGAARD MAY SHOUT IN WARNING: “IF MAN HAD NO ETERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING THERE WERE MERELY A WILD SEETHING FORCE PRODUCING EVERYTHING BOTH LARGE AND TRIFLING IN THE STORM OF DARK PASSIONS IF THE BOTTOMLESS VOID THAT NOTHING CAN FILL UNDERLAY ALL THINGS WHAT WOULD LIFE BE BUT DESPAIR?” THIS CRY IS NOT LIKELY TO STOP THE ABSURD MAN. SEEKING WHAT IS TRUE IS NOT SEEKING WHAT IS DESIRABLE. IF IN ORDER TO ELUDE THE ANXIOUS QUESTION: “WHAT WOULD LIFE BE?” ONE MUST LIKE THE DONKEY FEED ON THE ROSES OF ILLUSION THEN THE ABSURD MIND RATHER THAN RESIGNING ITSELF TO FALSEHOOD PREFERS TO ADOPT FEARLESSLY KIERKEGAARD’S REPLY: “DESPAIR.” EVERYTHING CONSIDERED A DETERMINED SOUL WILL ALWAYS MANAGE.

* * *
    I AM TAKING THE LIBERTY AT THIS POINT OF CALLING THE EXISTENTIAL ATTITUDE PHILOSOPHICAL SUICIDE. BUT THIS DOES NOT IMPLY A JUDGMENT. IT IS A CONVENIENT WAY OF INDICATING THE MOVEMENT BY WHICH A THOUGHT NEGATES ITSELF AND TENDS TO TRANSCEND ITSELF IN ITS VERY NEGATION. FOR THE EXISTENTIALS NEGATION IS THEIR GOD. TO BE PRECISE THAT GOD IS MAINTAINED ONLY THROUGH THE NEGATION OF HUMAN REASON.[8] BUT LIKE SUICIDES GODS CHANGE WITH MEN. THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF LEAPING THE ESSENTIAL BEING TO LEAP. THOSE REDEEMING NEGATIONS THOSE ULTIMATE CONTRADICTIONS WHICH NEGATE THE OBSTACLE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN LEAPED OVER MAY SPRING JUST AS WELL (THIS IS THE PARADOX AT WHICH THIS REASONING AIMS) FROM A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS INSPIRATION AS FROM THE RATIONAL ORDER. THEY ALWAYS LAY CLAIM TO THE ETERNAL AND IT IS SOLELY IN THIS THAT THEY TAKE THE LEAP.
    IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT THE REASONING DEVELOPED IN THIS ESSAY LEAVES OUT ALTOGETHER THE MOST WIDESPREAD SPIRITUAL ATTITUDE OF OUR ENLIGHTENED AGE: THE ONE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL IS REASON WHICH AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE WORLD. IT IS NATURAL TO GIVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE WORLD AFTER ACCEPTING THE IDEA THAT IT MUST BE CLEAR. THAT IS EVEN LEGITIMATE BUT DOES NOT CONCERN THE REASONING WE ARE FOLLOWING OUT HERE. IN FACT OUR AIM IS TO SHED LIGHT UPON THE STEP TAKEN BY THE MIND WHEN STARTING FROM A PHILOSOPHY OF THE WORLD’S LACK OF MEANING IT ENDS UP BY FINDING A MEANING AND DEPTH IN IT. THE MOST TOUCHING OF THOSE STEPS IS RELIGIOUS IN ESSENCE; IT BECOMES OBVIOUS IN THE THEME OF THE IRRATIONAL. BUT THE MOST PARADOXICAL AND MOST SIGNIFICANT IS CERTAINLY THE ONE THAT ATTRIBUTES RATIONAL REASONS TO A WORLD IT ORIGINALLY IMAGINED AS DEVOID OF ANY GUIDING PRINCIPLE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN ANY CASE TO REACH THE CONSEQUENCES THAT CONCERN US WITHOUT HAVING GIVEN AN IDEA OF THIS NEW ATTAINMENT OF THE SPIRIT OF NOSTALGIA.
    I SHALL EXAMINE MERELY THE THEME OF “THE INTENTION” MADE FASHIONABLE BY HUSSERL AND THE PHENOMENOLOGISTS. I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO IT. ORIGINALLY HUSSERL’S METHOD NEGATES THE CLASSIC PROCEDURE OF THE REASON. LET ME REPEAT. THINKING IS NOT UNIFYING OR MAKING THE APPEARANCE FAMILIAR UNDER THE GUISE OF A GREAT PRINCIPLE. THINKING IS LEARNING ALL OVER AGAIN HOW TO SEE DIRECTING ONE’S CONSCIOUSNESS MAKING OF EVERY IMAGE A PRIVILEGED PLACE. IN OTHER WORDS PHENOMENOLOGY DECLINES TO EXPLAIN THE WORLD IT WANTS TO BE MERELY A DESCRIPTION OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. IT CONFIRMS ABSURD THOUGHT IN ITS INITIAL ASSERTION THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH BUT MERELY TRUTHS. FROM THE EVENING BREEZE TO THIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER EVERYTHING HAS ITS TRUTH. CONSCIOUSNESS ILLUMINATES IT BY PAYING ATTENTION TO IT. CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT FORM THE OBJECT OF ITS UNDERSTANDING IT MERELY FOCUSES IT IS THE ACT OF ATTENTION AND TO BORROW A BERGSONIAN IMAGE IT RESEMBLES THE PROJECTOR THAT SUDDENLY FOCUSES ON AN IMAGE. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THERE IS NO SCENARIO BUT A SUCCESSIVE AND INCOHERENT ILLUSTRATION. IN THAT MAGIC LANTERN ALL THE PICTURES ARE PRIVILEGED. CONSCIOUSNESS SUSPENDS IN EXPERIENCE THE OBJECTS OF ITS ATTENTION. THROUGH ITS MIRACLE IT ISOLATES THEM. HENCEFORTH THEY ARE BEYOND ALL JUDGMENTS. THIS IS THE “INTENTION” THAT CHARACTERIZES CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT THE WORD DOES NOT IMPLY ANY IDEA OF FINALITY; IT IS TAKEN IN ITS SENSE OF “DIRECTION”: ITS ONLY VALUE IS TOPOGRAPHICAL.
    AT FIRST SIGHT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT IN THIS WAY NOTHING CONTRADICTS THE ABSURD SPIRIT. THAT APPARENT MODESTY OF THOUGHT THAT LIMITS ITSELF TO DESCRIBING WHAT IT DECLINES TO EXPLAIN THAT INTENTIONAL DISCIPLINE WHENCE RESULTS PARADOXICALLY A PROFOUND ENRICHMENT OF EXPERIENCE AND THE REBIRTH OF THE WORLD IN ITS PROLIXITY ARE ABSURD PROCEDURES. AT LEAST AT FIRST SIGHT. FOR METHODS OF THOUGHT IN THIS CASE AS ELSEWHERE ALWAYS ASSUME TWO ASPECTS ONE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND THE OTHER METAPHYSICAL.[9] THEREBY THEY HARBOR TWO TRUTHS. IF THE THEME OF THE INTENTIONAL CLAIMS TO ILLUSTRATE MERELY A PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDE BY WHICH REALITY IS DRAINED INSTEAD OF BEING EXPLAINED NOTHING IN FACT SEPARATES IT FROM THE ABSURD SPIRIT. IT AIMS TO ENUMERATE WHAT IT CANNOT TRANSCEND. IT AFFIRMS SOLELY THAT WITHOUT ANY UNIFYING PRINCIPLE THOUGHT CAN STILL TAKE DELIGHT IN DESCRIBING AND UNDERSTANDING EVERY ASPECT OF EXPERIENCE. THE TRUTH INVOLVED THEN FOR EACH OF THOSE ASPECTS IS PSYCHOLOGICAL IN NATURE. IT SIMPLY TESTIFIES TO THE “INTEREST” THAT REALITY CAN OFFER. IT IS A WAY OF AWAKING A SLEEPING WORLD AND OF MAKING IT VIVID TO THE MIND. BUT IF ONE ATTEMPTS TO EXTEND AND GIVE A RATIONAL BASIS TO THAT NOTION OF TRUTH IF ONE CLAIMS TO DISCOVER IN THIS WAY THE “ESSENCE” OF EACH OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE ONE RESTORES ITS DEPTH TO EXPERIENCE. FOR AN ABSURD MIND THAT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE. NOW IT IS THIS WAVERING BETWEEN MODESTY AND ASSURANCE THAT IS NOTICEABLE IN THE INTENTIONAL ATTITUDE AND THIS SHIMMERING OF PHENOMENOLOGICAL THOUGHT WILL ILLUSTRATE THE ABSURD REASONING BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
    FOR HUSSERL SPEAKS LIKEWISE OF “EXTRA-TEMPORAL ESSENCES” BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THE INTENTION AND HE SOUNDS LIKE PLATO. ALL THINGS ARE NOT EXPLAINED BY ONE THING BUT BY ALL THINGS. I SEE NO DIFFERENCE. TO BE SURE THOSE IDEAS OR THOSE ESSENCES THAT CONSCIOUSNESS “EFFECTUATES” AT THE END OF EVERY DESCRIPTION ARE NOT YET TO BE CONSIDERED PERFECT MODELS. BUT IT IS ASSERTED THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY PRESENT IN EACH DATUM OF PERCEPTION. THERE IS NO LONGER A SINGLE IDEA EXPLAINING EVERYTHING BUT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ESSENCES GIVING A MEANING TO AN INFINITE NUMBER OF OBJECTS. THE WORLD COMES TO A STOP BUT ALSO LIGHTS UP. PLATONIC REALISM BECOMES INTUITIVE BUT IT IS STILL REALISM. KIERKEGAARD WAS SWALLOWED UP IN HIS GOD; PARMENIDES PLUNGED THOUGHT INTO THE ONE. BUT HERE THOUGHT HURLS ITSELF INTO AN ABSTRACT POLYTHEISM. BUT THIS IS NOT ALL: HALLUCINATIONS AND FICTIONS LIKEWISE BELONG TO “EXTRA-TEMPORAL ESSENCES.” IN THE NEW WORLD OF IDEAS THE SPECIES OF CENTAURS COLLABORATES WITH THE MORE MODEST SPECIES OF METROPOLITAN MAN.
    FOR THE ABSURD MAN THERE WAS A TRUTH AS WELL AS A BITTERNESS IN THAT PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL OPINION THAT ALL ASPECTS OF THE WORLD ARE PRIVILEGED. TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS PRIVILEGED IS TANTAMOUNT TO SAYING THAT EVERYTHING IS EQUIVALENT. BUT THE METAPHYSICAL ASPECT OF THAT TRUTH IS SO FAR-REACHING THAT THROUGH AN ELEMENTARY REACTION HE FEELS CLOSER PERHAPS TO PLATO. HE IS TAUGHT IN FACT THAT EVERY IMAGE PRESUPPOSES AN EQUALLY PRIVILEGED ESSENCE. IN THIS IDEAL WORLD WITHOUT HIERARCHY THE FORMAL ARMY IS COMPOSED SOLELY OF GENERALS. TO BE SURE TRANSCENDENCY HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. BUT A SUDDEN SHIFT IN THOUGHT BRINGS BACK INTO THE WORLD A SORT OF FRAGMENTARY IMMANENCE WHICH RESTORES TO THE UNIVERSE ITS DEPTH.
    AM I TO FEAR HAVING CARRIED TOO FAR A THEME HANDLED WITH GREATER CIRCUMSPECTION BY ITS CREATORS? I READ MERELY THESE ASSERTIONS OF HUSSERL APPARENTLY PARADOXICAL YET RIGOROUSLY LOGICAL IF WHAT PRECEDES IS ACCEPTED: “THAT WHICH IS TRUE IS TRUE ABSOLUTELY IN ITSELF; TRUTH IS ONE IDENTICAL WITH ITSELF HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE CREATURES WHO PERCEIVE IT MEN MONSTERS ANGELS OR GODS.” REASON TRIUMPHS AND TRUMPETS FORTH WITH THAT VOICE I CANNOT DENY. WHAT CAN ITS ASSERTIONS MEAN IN THE ABSURD WORLD? THE PERCEPTION OF AN ANGEL OR A GOD HAS NO MEANING FOR ME. THAT GEOMETRICAL SPOT WHERE DIVINE REASON RATIFIES MINE WILL ALWAYS BE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME. THERE TOO I DISCERN A LEAP AND THOUGH PERFORMED IN THE ABSTRACT IT NONETHELESS MEANS FOR ME FORGETTING JUST WHAT I DO NOT WANT TO FORGET. WHEN FARTHER ON HUSSERL EXCLAIMS: “IF ALL MASSES SUBJECT TO ATTRACTION WERE TO DISAPPEAR THE LAW OF ATTRACTION WOULD NOT BE DESTROYED BUT WOULD SIMPLY REMAIN WITHOUT ANY POSSIBLE APPLICATION” I KNOW THAT I AM FACED WITH A METAPHYSIC OF CONSOLATION. AND IF I WANT TO DISCOVER THE POINT WHERE THOUGHT LEAVES THE PATH OF EVIDENCE I HAVE ONLY TO REREAD THE PARALLEL REASONING THAT HUSSERL VOICES REGARDING THE MIND: “IF WE COULD CONTEMPLATE CLEARLY THE EXACT LAWS OF PSYCHIC PROCESSES THEY WOULD BE SEEN TO BE LIKEWISE ETERNAL AND INVARIABLE LIKE THE BASIC LAWS OF THEORETICAL NATURAL SCIENCE. HENCE THEY WOULD BE VALID EVEN IF THERE WERE NO PSYCHIC PROCESS.” EVEN IF THE MIND WERE NOT ITS LAWS WOULD BE! I SEE THEN THAT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH HUSSERL AIMS TO MAKE A RATIONAL RULE: AFTER HAVING DENIED THE INTEGRATING POWER OF HUMAN REASON HE LEAPS BY THIS EXPEDIENT TO ETERNAL REASON.
    HUSSERL’S THEME OF THE “CONCRETE UNIVERSE” CANNOT THEN SURPRISE ME. IF I AM TOLD THAT ALL ESSENCES ARE NOT FORMAL BUT THAT SOME ARE MATERIAL THAT THE FIRST ARE THE OBJECT OF LOGIC AND THE SECOND OF SCIENCE THIS IS MERELY A QUESTION OF DEFINITION. THE ABSTRACT I AM TOLD INDICATES BUT A PART WITHOUT CONSISTENCY IN ITSELF OF A CONCRETE UNIVERSAL. BUT THE WAVERING ALREADY NOTED ALLOWS ME TO THROW LIGHT ON THE CONFUSION OF THESE TERMS. FOR THAT MAY MEAN THAT THE CONCRETE OBJECT OF MY ATTENTION THIS SKY THE REFLECTION OF THAT WATER ON THIS COAT ALONE PRESERVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE REAL THAT MY INTEREST ISOLATES IN THE WORLD. AND I SHALL NOT DENY IT. BUT THAT MAY MEAN ALSO THAT THIS COAT ITSELF IS UNIVERSAL HAS ITS PARTICULAR AND SUFFICIENT ESSENCE BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF FORMS. I THEN REALIZE THAT MERELY THE ORDER OF THE PROCESSION HAS BEEN CHANGED. THIS WORLD HAS CEASED TO HAVE ITS REFLECTION IN A HIGHER UNIVERSE BUT THE HEAVEN OF FORMS IS FIGURED IN THE HOST OF IMAGES OF THIS EARTH. THIS CHANGES NOTHING FOR ME. RATHER THAN ENCOUNTERING HERE A TASTE FOR THE CONCRETE THE MEANING OF THE HUMAN CONDITION I FIND AN INTELLECTUALISM SUFFICIENTLY UNBRIDLED TO GENERALIZE THE CONCRETE ITSELF.

* * *
    IT IS FUTILE TO BE AMAZED BY THE APPARENT PARADOX THAT LEADS THOUGHT TO ITS OWN NEGATION BY THE OPPOSITE PATHS OF HUMILIATED REASON AND TRIUMPHAL REASON. FROM THE ABSTRACT GOD OF HUSSERL TO THE DAZZLING GOD OF KIERKEGAARD THE DISTANCE IS NOT SO GREAT. REASON AND THE IRRATIONAL LEAD TO THE SAME PREACHING. IN TRUTH THE WAY MATTERS BUT LITTLE; THE WILL TO ARRIVE SUFFICES. THE ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHER AND THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHER START OUT FROM THE SAME DISORDER AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THE SAME ANXIETY. BUT THE ESSENTIAL IS TO EXPLAIN. NOSTALGIA IS STRONGER HERE THAN KNOWLEDGE. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE THOUGHT OF THE EPOCH IS AT ONCE ONE OF THE MOST DEEPLY IMBUED WITH A PHILOSOPHY OF THE NON-SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORLD AND ONE OF THE MOST DIVIDED IN ITS CONCLUSIONS. IT IS CONSTANTLY OSCILLATING BETWEEN EXTREME RATIONALIZATION OF REALITY WHICH TENDS TO BREAK UP THAT THOUGHT INTO STANDARD REASONS AND ITS EXTREME IRRATIONALIZATION WHICH TENDS TO DEIFY IT. BUT THIS DIVORCE IS ONLY APPARENT. IT IS A MATTER OF RECONCILIATION AND IN BOTH CASES THE LEAP SUFFICES. IT IS ALWAYS WRONGLY THOUGHT THAT THE NOTION OF REASON IS A ONEWAY NOTION. TO TELL THE TRUTH HOWEVER RIGOROUS IT MAY BE IN ITS AMBITION THIS CONCEPT IS NONETHELESS JUST AS UNSTABLE AS OTHERS. REASON BEARS A QUITE HUMAN ASPECT BUT IT ALSO IS ABLE TO TURN TOWARD THE DIVINE. SINCE PLOTINUS WHO WAS THE FIRST TO RECONCILE IT WITH THE ETERNAL CLIMATE IT HAS LEARNED TO TURN AWAY FROM THE MOST CHERISHED OF ITS PRINCIPLES WHICH IS CONTRADICTION IN ORDER TO INTEGRATE INTO IT THE STRANGEST THE QUITE MAGIC ONE OF PARTICIPATION.[10] IT IS AN INSTRUMENT OF THOUGHT AND NOT THOUGHT ITSELF. ABOVE ALL A MAN’S THOUGHT IS HIS NOSTALGIA.
    JUST AS REASON WAS ABLE TO SOOTHE THE MELANCHOLY OF PLOTINUS IT PROVIDES MODERN ANGUISH THE MEANS OF CALMING ITSELF IN THE FAMILIAR SETTING OF THE ETERNAL. THE ABSURD MIND HAS LESS LUCK. FOR IT THE WORLD IS NEITHER SO RATIONAL NOR SO IRRATIONAL. IT IS UNREASONABLE AND ONLY THAT. WITH HUSSERL THE REASON EVENTUALLY HAS NO LIMITS AT ALL. THE ABSURD ON THE CONTRARY ESTABLISHES ITS LIM-ITS SINCE IT IS POWERLESS TO CALM ITS ANGUISH. KIERKEGAARD INDEPENDENTLY ASSERTS THAT A SINGLE LIMIT IS ENOUGH TO NEGATE THAT ANGUISH. BUT THE ABSURD DOES NOT GO SO FAR. FOR IT THAT LIMIT IS DIRECTED SOLELY AT THE REASON’S AMBITIONS. THE THEME OF THE IRRATIONAL AS IT IS CONCEIVED BY THE EXISTENTIALS IS REASON BECOMING CONFUSED AND ESCAPING BY NEGATING ITSELF. THE ABSURD IS LUCID REASON NOTING ITS LIMITS.
    ONLY AT THE END OF THIS DIFFICULT PATH DOES THE ABSURD MAN RECOGNIZE HIS TRUE MOTIVES. UPON COMPARING HIS INNER EXIGENCE AND WHAT IS THEN OFFERED HIM HE SUDDENLY FEELS HE IS GOING TO TURN AWAY. IN THE UNIVERSE OF HUSSERL THE WORLD BECOMES CLEAR AND THAT LONGING FOR FAMILIARITY THAT MAN’S HEART HARBORS BECOMES USELESS. IN KIERKEGAARD’S APOCALYPSE THAT DESIRE FOR CLARITY MUST BE GIVEN UP IF IT WANTS TO BE SATISFIED. SIN IS NOT SO MUCH KNOWING (IF IT WERE EVERYBODY WOULD BE INNOCENT) AS WANTING TO KNOW. INDEED IT IS THE ONLY SIN OF WHICH THE ABSURD MAN CAN FEEL THAT IT CONSTITUTES BOTH HIS GUILT AND HIS INNOCENCE. HE IS OFFERED A SOLUTION IN WHICH ALL THE PAST CONTRADICTIONS HAVE BECOME MERELY POLEMICAL GAMES. BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY HE EXPERIENCED THEM. THEIR TRUTH MUST BE PRESERVED WHICH CONSISTS IN NOT BEING SATISFIED. HE DOES NOT WANT PREACHING.
    MY REASONING WANTS TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE EVIDENCE THAT AROUSED IT. THAT EVIDENCE IS THE ABSURD. IT IS THAT DIVORCE BETWEEN THE MIND THAT DESIRES AND THE WORLD THAT DISAPPOINTS MY NOSTALGIA FOR UNITY THIS FRAGMENTED UNIVERSE AND THE CONTRADICTION THAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER. KIERKEGAARD SUPPRESSES MY NOSTALGIA AND HUSSERL GATHERS TOGETHER THAT UNIVERSE. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. IT WAS A MATTER OF LIVING AND THINKING WITH THOSE DISLOCATIONS OF KNOWING WHETHER ONE HAD TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF MASKING THE EVIDENCE OF SUPPRESSING THE ABSURD BY DENYING ONE OF THE TERMS OF ITS EQUATION. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW WHETHER ONE CAN LIVE WITH IT OR WHETHER ON THE OTHER HAND LOGIC COMMANDS ONE TO DIE OF IT. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHICAL SUICIDE BUT RATHER IN PLAIN SUICIDE. I MERELY WISH TO PURGE IT OF ITS EMOTIONAL CONTENT AND KNOW ITS LOGIC AND ITS INTEGRITY. ANY OTHER POSITION IMPLIES FOR THE ABSURD MIND DECEIT AND THE MIND’S RETREAT BEFORE WHAT THE MIND ITSELF HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT. HUSSERL CLAIMS TO OBEY THE DESIRE TO ESCAPE “THE INVETERATE HABIT OF LIVING AND THINKING IN CERTAIN WELL- KNOWN AND CONVENIENT CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE” BUT THE FINAL LEAP RESTORES IN HIM THE ETERNAL AND ITS COMFORT. THE LEAP DOES NOT REPRESENT AN EXTREME DANGER AS KIERKEGAARD WOULD LIKE IT TO DO. THE DANGER ON THE CONTRARY LIES IN THE SUBTLE INSTANT THAT PRECEDES THE LEAP. BEING ABLE TO REMAIN ON THAT DIZZYING CREST—THAT IS INTEGRITY AND THE REST IS SUBTERFUGE. I KNOW ALSO THAT NEVER HAS HELPLESSNESS INSPIRED SUCH STRIKING HARMONIES AS THOSE OF KIERKEGAARD. BUT IF HELPLESSNESS HAS ITS PLACE IN THE INDIFFERENT LANDSCAPES OF HISTORY IT HAS NONE IN A REASONING WHOSE EXIGENCE IS NOW KNOWN.

ABSURD FREEDOM
    NOW THE MAIN THING IS DONE I HOLD CERTAIN FACTS FROM WHICH I CANNOT SEPARATE. WHAT I KNOW WHAT IS CERTAIN WHAT I CANNOT DENY WHAT I CANNOT REJECT—THIS IS WHAT COUNTS. I CAN NEGATE EVERYTHING OF THAT PART OF ME THAT LIVES ON VAGUE NOSTALGIAS EXCEPT THIS DESIRE FOR UNITY THIS LONGING TO SOLVE THIS NEED FOR CLARITY AND COHESION. I CAN REFUTE EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD SURROUNDING ME THAT OFFENDS OR ENRAPTURES ME EXCEPT THIS CHAOS THIS SOVEREIGN CHANCE AND THIS DIVINE EQUIVALENCE WHICH SPRINGS FROM ANARCHY. I DON’T KNOW WHETHER THIS WORLD HAS A MEANING THAT TRANSCENDS IT. BUT I KNOW THAT I DO NOT KNOW THAT MEANING AND THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME JUST NOW TO KNOW IT. WHAT CAN A MEANING OUTSIDE MY CONDITION MEAN TO ME? I CAN UNDERSTAND ONLY IN HUMAN TERMS. WHAT I TOUCH WHAT RESISTS ME—THAT IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND. AND THESE TWO CERTAINTIES—MY APPETITE FOR THE ABSOLUTE AND FOR UNITY AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF REDUCING THIS WORLD TO A RATIONAL AND REASONABLE PRINCIPLE—I ALSO KNOW THAT I CANNOT RECONCILE THEM. WHAT OTHER TRUTH CAN I ADMIT WITHOUT LYING WITHOUT BRINGING IN A HOPE I LACK AND WHICH MEANS NOTHING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MY CONDITION?
    IF I WERE A TREE AMONG TREES A CAT AMONG ANIMALS THIS LIFE WOULD HAVE A MEANING OR RATHER THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT ARISE FOR I SHOULD BELONG TO THIS WORLD. I SHOULD BE THIS WORLD TO WHICH I AM NOW OPPOSED BY MY WHOLE CONSCIOUSNESS AND MY WHOLE INSISTENCE UPON FAMILIARITY. THIS RIDICULOUS REASON IS WHAT SETS ME IN OPPOSITION TO ALL CREATION. I CANNOT CROSS IT OUT WITH A STROKE OF THE PEN. WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE TRUE I MUST THEREFORE PRESERVE. WHAT SEEMS TO ME SO OBVIOUS EVEN AGAINST ME I MUST SUPPORT. AND WHAT CONSTITUTES THE BASIS OF THAT CONFLICT OF THAT BREAK BETWEEN THE WORLD AND MY MIND BUT THE AWARENESS OF IT? IF THEREFORE I WANT TO PRESERVE IT I CAN THROUGH A CONSTANT AWARENESS EVER REVIVED EVER ALERT. THIS IS WHAT FOR THE MOMENT I MUST REMEMBER. AT THIS MOMENT THE ABSURD SO OBVIOUS AND YET SO HARD TO WIN RETURNS TO A MAN’S LIFE AND FINDS ITS HOME THERE. AT THIS MOMENT TOO THE MIND CAN LEAVE THE ARID DRIED-UP PATH OF LUCID EFFORT. THAT PATH NOW EMERGES IN DAILY LIFE. IT ENCOUNTERS THE WORLD OF THE ANONYMOUS IMPERSONAL PRONOUN “ONE” BUT HENCEFORTH MAN ENTERS IN WITH HIS REVOLT AND HIS LUCIDITY. HE HAS FORGOTTEN HOW TO HOPE. THIS HELL OF THE PRESENT IS HIS KINGDOM AT LAST. ALL PROBLEMS RECOVER THEIR SHARP EDGE. ABSTRACT EVIDENCE RETREATS BEFORE THE POETRY OF FORMS AND COLORS. SPIRITUAL CONFLICTS BECOME EMBODIED AND RETURN TO THE ABJECT AND MAGNIFICENT SHELTER OF MAN’S HEART. NONE OF THEM IS SETTLED. BUT ALL ARE TRANSFIGURED. IS ONE GOING TO DIE ESCAPE BY THE LEAP REBUILD A MANSION OF IDEAS AND FORMS TO ONE’S OWN SCALE? IS ONE ON THE CONTRARY GOING TO TAKE UP THE HEART-RENDING AND MARVELOUS WAGER OF THE ABSURD? LET’S MAKE A FINAL EFFORT IN THIS REGARD AND DRAW ALL OUR CONCLUSIONS. THE BODY AFFECTION CREATION ACTION HUMAN NOBILITY WILL THEN RESUME THEIR PLACES IN THIS MAD WORLD. AT LAST MAN WILL AGAIN FIND THERE THE WINE OF THE ABSURD AND THE BREAD OF INDIFFERENCE ON WHICH HE FEEDS HIS GREATNESS.
    LET US INSIST AGAIN ON THE METHOD: IT IS A MATTER OF PERSISTING. AT A CERTAIN POINT ON HIS PATH THE ABSURD MAN IS TEMPTED. HISTORY IS NOT LACKING IN EITHER RELIGIONS OR PROPHETS EVEN WITHOUT GODS. HE IS ASKED TO LEAP. ALL HE CAN REPLY IS THAT HE DOESN’T FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT OBVIOUS. INDEED HE DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING BUT WHAT HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS. HE IS ASSURED THAT THIS IS THE SIN OF PRIDE BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE NOTION OF SIN; THAT PERHAPS HELL IS IN STORE BUT HE HAS NOT ENOUGH IMAGINATION TO VISUALIZE THAT STRANGE FUTURE; THAT HE IS LOSING IMMORTAL LIFE BUT THAT SEEMS TO HIM AN IDLE CONSIDERATION. AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO GET HIM TO ADMIT HIS GUILT. HE FEELS INNOCENT. TO TELL THE TRUTH THAT IS ALL HE FEELS—HIS IRREPARABLE INNOCENCE. THIS IS WHAT ALLOWS HIM EVERYTHING. HENCE WHAT HE DEMANDS OF HIMSELF IS TO LIVE SOLELY WITH WHAT HE KNOWS TO ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF TO WHAT IS AND TO BRING IN NOTHING THAT IS NOT CERTAIN. HE IS TOLD THAT NOTHING IS. BUT THIS AT LEAST IS A CERTAINTY. AND IT IS WITH THIS THAT HE IS CONCERNED: HE WANTS TO FIND OUT IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO LIVE WITHOUT APPEAL.

* * *
    NOW I CAN BROACH THE NOTION OF SUICIDE. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN FELT WHAT SOLUTION MIGHT BE GIVEN. AT THIS POINT THE PROBLEM IS REVERSED. IT WAS PREVIOUSLY A QUESTION OF FINDING OUT WHETHER OR NOT LIFE HAD TO HAVE A MEANING TO BE LIVED. IT NOW BECOMES CLEAR ON THE CONTRARY THAT IT WILL BE LIVED ALL THE BETTER IF IT HAS NO MEANING. LIVING AN EXPERIENCE A PARTICULAR FATE IS ACCEPTING IT FULLY. NOW NO ONE WILL LIVE THIS FATE KNOWING IT TO BE ABSURD UNLESS HE DOES EVERYTHING TO KEEP BEFORE HIM THAT ABSURD BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY CONSCIOUSNESS. NEGATING ONE OF THE TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION ON WHICH HE LIVES AMOUNTS TO ESCAPING IT. TO ABOLISH CONSCIOUS REVOLT IS TO ELUDE THE PROBLEM. THE THEME OF PERMANENT REVOLUTION IS THUS CARRIED INTO INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE. LIVING IS KEEPING THE ABSURD ALIVE. KEEPING IT ALIVE IS ABOVE ALL CONTEMPLATING IT. UNLIKE EURYDICE THE ABSURD DIES ONLY WHEN WE TURN AWAY FROM IT. ONE OF THE ONLY COHERENT PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS IS THUS REVOLT. IT IS A CONSTANT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MAN AND HIS OWN OBSCURITY. IT IS AN INSISTENCE UPON AN IMPOSSIBLE TRANSPARENCY. IT CHALLENGES THE WORLD ANEW EVERY SECOND. JUST AS DANGER PROVIDED MAN THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY OF SEIZING AWARENESS SO METAPHYSICAL REVOLT EXTENDS AWARENESS TO THE WHOLE OF EXPERIENCE. IT IS THAT CONSTANT PRESENCE OF MAN IN HIS OWN EYES. IT IS NOT ASPIRATION FOR IT IS DEVOID OF HOPE. THAT REVOLT IS THE CERTAINLY OF A CRUSHING FATE WITHOUT THE RESIGNATION THAT OUGHT TO ACCOMPANY IT.
    THIS IS WHERE IT IS SEEN TO WHAT A DEGREE ABSURD EXPERIENCE IS REMOTE FROM SUICIDE. IT MAY BE THOUGHT THAT SUICIDE FOLLOWS REVOLT—BUT WRONGLY. FOR IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF REVOLT. IT IS JUST THE CONTRARY BY THE CONSENT IT PRESUPPOSES. SUICIDE LIKE THE LEAP IS ACCEPTANCE AT ITS EXTREME. EVERYTHING IS OVER AND MAN RETURNS TO HIS ESSENTIAL HISTORY. HIS FUTURE HIS UNIQUE AND DREADFUL FUTURE—HE SEES AND RUSHES TOWARD IT. IN ITS WAY SUICIDE SETTLES THE ABSURD. IT ENGULFS THE ABSURD IN THE SAME DEATH. BUT I KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP ALIVE THE ABSURD CANNOT BE SETTLED. IT ESCAPES SUICIDE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY AWARENESS AND REJECTION OF DEATH. IT IS AT THE EXTREME LIMIT OF THE CONDEMNED MAN’S LAST THOUGHT THAT SHOELACE THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING HE SEES A FEW YARDS AWAY ON THE VERY BRINK OF HIS DIZZYING FALL. THE CONTRARY OF SUICIDE IN FACT IS THE MAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH.
    THAT REVOLT GIVES LIFE ITS VALUE. SPREAD OUT OVER THE WHOLE LENGTH OF A LIFE IT RESTORES ITS MAJESTY TO THAT LIFE. TO A MAN DEVOID OF BLINDERS THERE IS NO FINER SIGHT THAN THAT OF THE INTELLIGENCE AT GRIPS WITH A REALITY THAT TRANSCENDS IT. THE SIGHT OF HUMAN PRIDE IS UNEQUALED. NO DISPARAGEMENT IS OF ANY USE. THAT DISCIPLINE THAT THE MIND IMPOSES ON ITSELF THAT WILL CONJURED UP OUT OF NOTHING THAT FACE-TO-FACE STRUGGLE HAVE SOMETHING EXCEPTIONAL ABOUT THEM. TO IMPOVERISH THAT REALITY WHOSE INHUMANITY CONSTITUTES MAN’S MAJESTY IS TANTAMOUNT TO IMPOVERISHING HIM HIMSELF. I UNDERSTAND THEN WHY THE DOCTRINES THAT EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO ME ALSO DEBILITATE ME AT THE SAME TIME. THEY RELIEVE ME OF THE WEIGHT OF MY OWN LIFE AND YET I MUST CARRY IT ALONE. AT THIS JUNCTURE I CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT A SKEPTICAL METAPHYSICS CAN BE JOINED TO AN ETHICS OF RENUNCIATION.
    CONSCIOUSNESS AND REVOLT THESE REJECTIONS ARE THE CONTRARY OF RENUNCIATION. EVERYTHING THAT IS INDOMITABLE AND PASSIONATE IN A HUMAN HEART QUICKENS THEM ON THE CONTRARY WITH ITS OWN LIFE. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DIE UNRECON-CILED AND NOT OF ONE’S OWN FREE WILL. SUICIDE IS A REPUDI—ATION. THE ABSURD MAN CAN ONLY DRAIN EVERYTHING TO THE BITTER END AND DEPLETE HIMSELF. THE ABSURD IS HIS EXTREME TENSION WHICH HE MAINTAINS CONSTANTLY BY SOLITARY EFFORT FOR HE KNOWS THAT IN THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND IN THAT DAY-TO-DAY REVOLT HE GIVES PROOF OF HIS ONLY TRUTH WHICH IS DEFIANCE. THIS IS A FIRST CONSEQUENCE.

* * *
    IF I REMAIN IN THAT PREARRANGED POSITION WHICH CONSISTS IN DRAWING ALL THE CONCLUSIONS (AND NOTHING ELSE) INVOLVED IN A NEWLY DISCOVERED NOTION I AM FACED WITH A SECOND PARADOX. IN ORDER TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THAT METHOD I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM OF METAPHYSICAL LIBERTY. KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT MAN IS FREE DOESN’T INTEREST ME. I CAN EXPERIENCE ONLY MY OWN FREEDOM. AS TO IT I CAN HAVE NO GENERAL NOTIONS BUT MERELY A FEW CLEAR INSIGHTS. THE PROBLEM OF “FREEDOM AS SUCH” HAS NO MEANING FOR IT IS LINKED IN QUITE A DIFFERENT WAY WITH THE PROBLEM OF GOD. KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT MAN IS FREE INVOLVES KNOWING WHETHER HE CAN HAVE A MASTER. THE ABSURDITY PECULIAR TO THIS PROBLEM COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THE VERY NOTION THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM OF FREEDOM POSSIBLE ALSO TAKES AWAY ALL ITS MEANING. FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THERE IS LESS A PROBLEM OF FREEDOM THAN A PROBLEM OF EVIL. YOU KNOW THE ALTERNATIVE: EITHER WE ARE NOT FREE AND GOD THE ALL-POWERFUL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVIL. OR WE ARE FREE AND RESPONSIBLE BUT GOD IS NOT ALL POWERFUL. ALL THE SCHOLASTIC SUBTLETIES HAVE NEITHER ADDED ANYTHING TO NOR SUBTRACTED ANYTHING FROM THE ACUTENESS OF THIS PARADOX.
    THIS IS WHY I CANNOT ACT LOST IN THE GLORIFICATION OR THE MERE DEFINITION OF A NOTION WHICH ELUDES ME AND LOSES ITS MEANING AS SOON AS IT GOES BEYOND THE FRAME OF REFERENCE OF MY INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF FREEDOM WOULD BE GIVEN ME BY A HIGHER BEING. I HAVE LOST THE SENSE OF HIERARCHY. THE ONLY CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM I CAN HAVE IS THAT OF THE PRISONER OR THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE MIDST OF THE STATE. THE ONLY ONE I KNOW IS FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND ACTION. NOW IF THE ABSURD CANCELS ALL MY CHANCES OF ETERNAL FREEDOM IT RESTORES AND MAGNIFIES ON THE OTHER HAND MY FREEDOM OF ACTION. THAT PRIVATION OF HOPE AND FUTURE MEANS AN INCREASE IN MAN’S AVAILABILITY.
    BEFORE ENCOUNTERING THE ABSURD THE EVERYDAY MAN LIVES WITH AIMS A CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE OR FOR JUSTIFICATION (WITH REGARD TO WHOM OR WHAT IS NOT THE QUESTION). HE WEIGHS HIS CHANCES HE COUNTS ON “SOMEDAY” HIS RETIREMENT OR THE LABOR OF HIS SONS. HE STILL THINKS THAT SOMETHING IN HIS LIFE CAN BE DIRECTED. IN TRUTH HE ACTS AS IF HE WERE FREE EVEN IF ALL THE FACTS MAKE A POINT OF CONTRADICTING THAT LIBERTY. BUT AFTER THE ABSURD EVERYTHING IS UPSET. THAT IDEA THAT “I AM” MY WAY OF ACTING AS IF EVERYTHING HAS A MEANING (EVEN IF ON OCCASION I SAID THAT NOTHING HAS)—ALL THAT IS GIVEN THE LIE IN VERTIGINOUS FASHION BY THE ABSURDITY OF A POSSIBLE DEATH. THINKING OF THE FUTURE ESTABLISHING AIMS FOR ONESELF HAVING PREFERENCES—ALL THIS PRESUPPOSES A BELIEF IN FREEDOM EVEN IF ONE OCCASIONALLY ASCERTAINS THAT ONE DOESN’T FEEL IT. BUT AT THAT MOMENT I AM WELL AWARE THAT THAT HIGHER LIBERTY THAT FREEDOM TO BE WHICH ALONE CAN SERVE AS BASIS FOR A TRUTH DOES NOT EXIST. DEATH IS THERE AS THE ONLY REALITY. AFTER DEATH THE CHIPS ARE DOWN. I AM NOT EVEN FREE EITHER TO PERPETUATE MYSELF BUT A SLAVE AND ABOVE ALL A SLAVE WITHOUT HOPE OF AN ETERNAL REVOLUTION WITHOUT RECOURSE TO CONTEMPT. AND WHO WITHOUT REVOLUTION AND WITHOUT CONTEMPT CAN REMAIN A SLAVE? WHAT FREEDOM CAN EXIST IN THE FULLEST SENSE WITHOUT ASSURANCE OF ETERNITY?
    BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE ABSURD MAN REALIZES THAT HITHERTO HE WAS BOUND TO THAT POSTULATE OF FREEDOM ON THE ILLUSION OF WHICH HE WAS LIVING. IN A CERTAIN SENSE THAT HAMPERED HIM. TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE IMAGINED A PURPOSE TO HIS LIFE HE ADAPTED HIMSELF TO THE DEMANDS OF A PURPOSE TO BE ACHIEVED AND BECAME THE SLAVE OF HIS LIBERTY. THUS I COULD NOT ACT OTHERWISE THAN AS THE FATHER (OR THE ENGINEER OR THE LEADER OF A NATION OR THE POST-OFFICE SUB-CLERK) THAT I AM PREPARING TO BE. I THINK I CAN CHOOSE TO BE THAT RATHER THAN SOMETHING ELSE. I THINK SO UNCONSCIOUSLY TO BE SURE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I STRENGTHEN MY POSTULATE WITH THE BELIEFS OF THOSE AROUND ME WITH THE PRESUMPTIONS OF MY HUMAN ENVIRONMENT (OTHERS ARE SO SURE OF BEING FREE AND THAT CHEERFUL MOOD IS SO CONTAGIOUS!). HOWEVER FAR ONE MAY REMAIN FROM ANY PRESUMPTION MORAL OR SOCIAL ONE IS PARTLY INFLUENCED BY THEM AND EVEN FOR THE BEST AMONG THEM (THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD PRESUMPTIONS) ONE ADAPTS ONE’S LIFE TO THEM. THUS THE ABSURD MAN REALIZES THAT HE WAS NOT REALLY FREE. TO SPEAK CLEARLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH I HOPE TO WHICH I WORRY ABOUT A TRUTH THAT MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL TO ME ABOUT A WAY OF BEING OR CREATING TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH I ARRANGE MY LIFE AND PROVE THEREBY THAT I ACCEPT ITS HAVING A MEANING I CREATE FOR MYSELF BARRIERS BETWEEN WHICH I CONFINE MY LIFE. I DO LIKE SO MANY BUREAUCRATS OF THE MIND AND HEART WHO ONLY FILL ME WITH DISGUST AND WHOSE ONLY VICE I NOW SEE CLEARLY IS TO TAKE MAN’S FREEDOM SERIOUSLY.
    THE ABSURD ENLIGHTENS ME ON THIS POINT: THERE IS NO FUTURE. HENCEFORTH THIS IS THE REASON FOR MY INNER FREEDOM. I SHALL USE TWO COMPARISONS HERE. MYSTICS TO BEGIN WITH FIND FREEDOM IN GIVING THEMSELVES. BY LOSING THEMSELVES IN THEIR GOD BY ACCEPTING HIS RULES THEY BECOME SECRETLY FREE. IN SPONTANEOUSLY ACCEPTED SLAVERY THEY RECOVER A DEEPER INDEPENDENCE. BUT WHAT DOES THAT FREEDOM MEAN? IT MAY BE SAID ABOVE ALL THAT THEY FEEL FREE WITH REGARD TO THEMSELVES AND NOT SO MUCH FREE AS LIBERATED. LIKEWISE COMPLETELY TURNED TOWARD DEATH (TAKEN HERE AS THE MOST OBVIOUS ABSURDITY) THE ABSURD MAN FEELS RELEASED FROM EVERYTHING OUTSIDE THAT PASSIONATE ATTENTION CRYSTALLIZING IN HIM. HE ENJOYS A FREEDOM WITH REGARD TO COMMON RULES. IT CAN BE SEEN AT THIS POINT THAT THE INITIAL THEMES OF EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHY KEEP THEIR ENTIRE VALUE. THE RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS THE ESCAPE FROM EVERYDAY SLEEP REPRESENT THE FIRST STEPS OF ABSURD FREEDOM. BUT IT IS EXISTENTIAL PREACHING THAT IS ALLUDED TO AND WITH IT THAT SPIRITUAL LEAP WHICH BASICALLY ESCAPES CONSCIOUSNESS. IN THE SAME WAY (THIS IS MY SECOND COMPARISON) THE SLAVES OF ANTIQUITY DID NOT BELONG TO THEMSELVES. BUT THEY KNEW THAT FREEDOM WHICH CONSISTS IN NOT FEELING RESPONSIBLE.[11] DEATH TOO HAS PATRICIAN HANDS WHICH WHILE CRUSHING ALSO LIBERATE.
    LOSING ONESELF IN THAT BOTTOMLESS CERTAINTY FEELING HENCEFORTH SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE FROM ONE’S OWN LIFE TO INCREASE IT AND TAKE A BROAD VIEW OF IT—THIS INVOLVES THE PRINCIPLE OF A LIBERATION. SUCH NEW INDEPENDENCE HAS A DEFINITE TIME LIMIT LIKE ANY FREEDOM OF ACTION. IT DOES NOT WRITE A CHECK ON ETERNITY. BUT IT TAKES THE PLACE OF THE ILLUSIONS OF FREEDOM WHICH ALL STOPPED WITH DEATH. THE DIVINE AVAILABILITY OF THE CONDEMNED MAN BEFORE WHOM THE PRISON DOORS OPEN IN A CERTAIN EARLY DAWN THAT UNBELIEVABLE DISINTERESTEDNESS WITH REGARD TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE PURE FLAME OF LIFE—IT IS CLEAR THAT DEATH AND THE ABSURD ARE HERE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ONLY REASONABLE FREEDOM: THAT WHICH A HUMAN HEART CAN EXPERIENCE AND LIVE. THIS IS A SECOND CONSEQUENCE. THE ABSURD MAN THUS CATCHES SIGHT OF A BURNING AND FRIGID TRANSPARENT AND LIMITED UNIVERSE IN WHICH NOTHING IS POSSIBLE BUT EVERYTHING IS GIVEN AND BEYOND WHICH ALL IS COLLAPSE AND NOTHINGNESS. HE CAN THEN DECIDE TO ACCEPT SUCH A UNIVERSE AND DRAW FROM IT HIS STRENGTH HIS REFUSAL TO HOPE AND THE UNYIELDING EVIDENCE OF A LIFE WITHOUT CONSOLATION.

* * *
    BUT WHAT DOES LIFE MEAN IN SUCH A UNIVERSE? NOTHING ELSE FOR THE MOMENT BUT INDIFFERENCE TO THE FUTURE AND A DESIRE TO USE UP EVERYTHING THAT IS GIVEN. BELIEF IN THE MEANING OF LIFE ALWAYS IMPLIES A SCALE OF VALUES A CHOICE OUR PREFERENCES. BELIEF IN THE ABSURD ACCORDING TO OUR DEFINITIONS TEACHES THE CONTRARY. BUT THIS IS WORTH EXAMINING.
    KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN LIVE WITHOUT APPEAL IS ALL THAT INTERESTS ME. I DO NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF MY DEPTH. THIS ASPECT OF LIFE BEING GIVEN ME CAN I ADAPT MYSELF TO IT? NOW FACED WITH THIS PARTICULAR CONCERN BELIEF IN THE ABSURD IS TANTAMOUNT TO SUBSTITUTING THE QUANTITY OF EXPERIENCES FOR THE QUALITY. IF I CONVINCE MYSELF THAT THIS LIFE HAS NO OTHER ASPECT THAN THAT OF THE ABSURD IF I FEEL THAT ITS WHOLE EQUILIBRIUM DEPENDS ON THAT PERPETUAL OPPOSITION BETWEEN MY CONSCIOUS REVOLT AND THE DARKNESS IN WHICH IT STRUGGLES IF I ADMIT THAT MY FREEDOM HAS NO MEANING EXCEPT IN RELATION TO ITS LIMITED FATE THEN I MUST SAY THAT WHAT COUNTS IS NOT THE BEST LIVING BUT THE MOST LIVING. IT IS NOT UP TO ME TO WONDER IF THIS IS VULGAR OR REVOLTING ELEGANT OR DEPLORABLE. ONCE AND FOR ALL VALUE JUDGMENTS ARE DISCARDED HERE IN FAVOR OF FACTUAL JUDGMENTS. I HAVE MERELY TO DRAW THE CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT I CAN SEE AND TO RISK NOTHING THAT IS HYPOTHETICAL. SUPPOSING THAT LIVING IN THIS WAY WERE NOT HONORABLE THEN TRUE PROPRIETY WOULD COMMAND ME TO BE DISHONORABLE.
    THE MOST LIVING; IN THE BROADEST SENSE THAT RULE MEANS NOTHING. IT CALLS FOR DEFINITION. IT SEEMS TO BEGIN WITH THE FACT THAT THE NOTION OF QUANTITY HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORED. FOR IT CAN ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE SHARE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. A MAN’S RULE OF CONDUCT AND HIS SCALE OF VALUES HAVE NO MEANING EXCEPT THROUGH THE QUANTITY AND VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES HE HAS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ACCUMULATE. NOW THE CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE IMPOSE ON THE MAJORITY OF MEN THE SAME QUANTITY OF EXPERIENCES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SAME PROFOUND EXPERIENCE. TO BE SURE THERE MUST ALSO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE INDIVIDUAL’S SPONTANEOUS CONTRIBUTION THE “GIVEN” ELEMENT IN HIM. BUT I CANNOT JUDGE OF THAT AND LET ME REPEAT THAT MY RULE HERE IS TO GET ALONG WITH THE IMMEDIATE EVIDENCE. I SEE THEN THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER OF A COMMON CODE OF ETHICS LIES NOT SO MUCH IN THE IDEAL IMPORTANCE OF ITS BASIC PRINCIPLES AS IN THE NORM OF AN EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO MEASURE. TO STRETCH A POINT SOMEWHAT THE GREEKS HAD THE CODE OF THEIR LEISURE JUST AS WE HAVE THE CODE OF OUR EIGHT-HOUR DAY. BUT ALREADY MANY MEN AMONG THE MOST TRAGIC CAUSE US TO FORESEE THAT A LONGER EXPERIENCE CHANGES THIS TABLE OF VALUES. THEY MAKE US IMAGINE THAT ADVENTURER OF THE EVERYDAY WHO THROUGH MERE QUANTITY OF EXPERIENCES WOULD BREAK ALL RECORDS (I AM PURPOSELY USING THIS SPORTS EXPRESSION) AND WOULD THUS WIN HIS OWN CODE OF ETHICS.[12] YET LET’S AVOID ROMANTICISM AND JUST ASK OURSELVES WHAT SUCH AN ATTITUDE MAY MEAN TO A MAN WITH HIS MIND MADE UP TO TAKE UP HIS BET AND TO OBSERVE STRICTLY WHAT HE TAKES TO BE THE RULES OF THE GAME.
    BREAKING ALL THE RECORDS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST BEING FACED WITH THE WORLD AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. HOW CAN THAT BE DONE WITHOUT CONTRADICTIONS AND WITHOUT PLAYING ON WORDS? FOR ON THE ONE HAND THE ABSURD TEACHES THAT ALL EXPERIENCES ARE UNIMPORTANT AND ON THE OTHER IT URGES TOWARD THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF EXPERIENCES. HOW THEN CAN ONE FAIL TO DO AS SO MANY OF THOSE MEN I WAS SPEAKING OF EARLIER—CHOOSE THE FORM OF LIFE THAT BRINGS US THE MOST POSSIBLE OF THAT HUMAN MATTER THEREBY INTRODUCING A SCALE OF VALUES THAT ON THE OTHER HAND ONE CLAIMS TO REJECT?
    BUT AGAIN IT IS THE ABSURD AND ITS CONTRADICTORY LIFE THAT TEACHES US. FOR THE MISTAKE IS THINKING THAT THAT QUANTITY OF EXPERIENCES DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR LIFE WHEN IT DEPENDS SOLELY ON US. HERE WE HAVE TO BE OVER-SIMPLE. TO TWO MEN LIVING THE SAME NUMBER OF YEARS THE WORLD ALWAYS PROVIDES THE SAME SUM OF EXPERIENCES. IT IS UP TO US TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THEM. BEING AWARE OF ONE’S LIFE ONE’S REVOLT ONE’S FREEDOM AND TO THE MAXIMUM IS LIVING AND TO THE MAXIMUM. WHERE LUCIDITY DOMINATES THE SCALE OF VALUES BECOMES USELESS. LET’S BE EVEN MORE SIMPLE. LET US SAY THAT THE SOLE OBSTACLE THE SOLE DEFICIENCY TO BE MADE GOOD IS CONSTITUTED BY PREMATURE DEATH. THUS IT IS THAT NO DEPTH NO EMOTION NO PASSION AND NO SACRIFICE COULD RENDER EQUAL IN THE EYES OF THE ABSURD MAN (EVEN IF HE WISHED IT SO) A CONSCIOUS LIFE OF FORTY YEARS AND A LUCIDITY SPREAD OVER SIXTY YEARS.[13] MADNESS AND DEATH ARE HIS IRREPARABLES. MAN DOES NOT CHOOSE. THE ABSURD AND THE EXTRA LIFE IT INVOLVES THEREFORE DO NOT DEPEND ON MAN’S WILL BUT ON ITS CONTRARY WHICH IS DEATH.[14] WEIGHING WORDS CAREFULLY IT IS ALTOGETHER A QUESTION OF LUCK. ONE JUST HAS TO BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO THIS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY SUBSTITUTE FOR TWENTY YEARS OF LIFE AND EXPERIENCE.
    BY WHAT IS AN ODD INCONSISTENCY IN SUCH AN ALERT RACE THE GREEKS CLAIMED THAT THOSE WHO DIED YOUNG WERE BELOVED OF THE GODS. AND THAT IS TRUE ONLY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT ENTERING THE RIDICULOUS WORLD OF THE GODS IS FOREVER LOSING THE PUREST OF JOYS WHICH IS FEELING AND FEELING ON THIS EARTH. THE PRESENT AND THE SUCCESSION OF PRESENTS BEFORE A CONSTANTLY CONSCIOUS SOUL IS THE IDEAL OF THE ABSURD MAN. BUT THE WORD “IDEAL” RINGS FALSE IN THIS CONNECTION. IT IS NOT EVEN HIS VOCATION BUT MERELY THE THIRD CONSEQUENCE OF HIS REASONING. HAVING STARTED FROM AN ANGUISHED AWARENESS OF THE INHUMAN THE MEDITATION ON THE ABSURD RETURNS AT THE END OF ITS ITINERARY TO THE VERY HEART OF THE PASSIONATE FLAMES OF HUMAN REVOLT.[15]

* * *
    THUS I DRAW FROM THE ABSURD THREE CONSEQUENCES WHICH ARE MY REVOLT MY FREEDOM AND MY PASSION. BY THE MERE ACTIVITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS I TRANSFORM INTO A RULE OF LIFE WHAT WAS AN INVITATION TO DEATH—AND I REFUSE SUICIDE. I KNOW TO BE SURE THE DULL RESONANCE THAT VIBRATES THROUGHOUT THESE DAYS. YET I HAVE BUT A WORD TO SAY: THAT IT IS NECESSARY. WHEN NIETZSCHE WRITES: “IT CLEARLY SEEMS THAT THE CHIEF THING IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH IS TO OBEY AT LENGTH AND IN A SINGLE DIRECTION: IN THE LONG RUN THERE RESULTS SOMETHING FOR WHICH IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF LIVING ON THIS EARTH AS FOR EXAMPLE VIRTUE ART MUSIC THE DANCE REASON THE MIND— SOMETHING THAT TRANSFIGURES SOMETHING DELICATE MAD OR DIVINE” HE ELUCIDATES THE RULE OF A REALLY DISTINGUISHED CODE OF ETHICS. BUT HE ALSO POINTS THE WAY OF THE ABSURD MAN. OBEYING THE FLAME IS BOTH THE EASIEST AND THE HARDEST THING TO DO. HOWEVER IT IS GOOD FOR MAN TO JUDGE HIMSELF OCCASIONALLY. HE IS ALONE IN BEING ABLE TO DO SO.
    “PRAYER” SAYS ALAIN “IS WHEN NIGHT DESCENDS OVER THOUGHT.”
    “BUT THE MIND MUST MEET THE NIGHT” REPLY THE MYSTICS AND THE EXISTENTIALS. YES INDEED BUT NOT THAT NIGHT THAT IS BORN UNDER CLOSED EYELIDS AND THROUGH THE MERE WILL OF MAN—DARK IMPENETRABLE NIGHT THAT THE MIND CALLS UP IN ORDER TO PLUNGE INTO IT. IF IT MUST ENCOUNTER A NIGHT LET IT BE RATHER THAT OF DESPAIR WHICH REMAINS LUCID—POLAR NIGHT VIGIL OF THE MIND WHENCE WILL ARISE PERHAPS THAT WHITE AND VIRGINAL BRIGHTNESS WHICH OUTLINES EVERY OBJECT IN THE LIGHT OF THE INTELLIGENCE. AT THAT DEGREE EQUIVALENCE ENCOUNTERS PASSIONATE UNDERSTANDING. THEN IT IS NO LONGER EVEN A QUESTION OF JUDGING THE EXISTENTIAL LEAP. IT RESUMES ITS PLACE AMID THE AGE-OLD FRESCO OF HUMAN ATTITUDES. FOR THE SPECTATOR IF HE IS CONSCIOUS THAT LEAP IS STILL ABSURD. IN SO FAR AS IT THINKS IT SOLVES THE PARADOX IT REINSTATES IT INTACT. ON THIS SCORE IT IS STIRRING. ON THIS SCORE EVERYTHING RESUMES ITS PLACE AND THE ABSURD WORLD IS REBORN IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR AND DIVERSITY.
    BUT IT IS BAD TO STOP HARD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SINGLE WAY OF SEEING TO GO WITHOUT CONTRADICTION PERHAPS THE MOST SUBTLE OF ALL SPIRITUAL FORCES. THE PRECEDING MERELY DEFINES A WAY OF THINKING. BUT THE POINT IS TO LIVE.



    IF STAVROGIN BELIEVES HE DOES NOT THINK HE BELIEVES. IF HE DOES NOT BELIEVE HE DOES NOT THINK HE DOES NOT BELIEVE.
    —THE POSSESSED



  MY FIELD” SAID GOETHE “IS TIME.” THAT IS INDEED THE ABSURD SPEECH. WHAT IN FACT IS THE ABSURD MAN? HE WHO WITHOUT NEGATING IT DOES NOTHING FOR THE ETERNAL. NOT THAT NOSTALGIA IS FOREIGN TO HIM. BUT HE PREFERS HIS COURAGE AND HIS REASONING. THE FIRST TEACHES HIM TO LIVE WITHOUT APPEAL AND TO GET ALONG WITH WHAT HE HAS; THE SECOND INFORMS HIM OF HIS LIMITS. ASSURED OF HIS TEMPORALLY LIMITED FREEDOM OF HIS REVOLT DEVOID OF FUTURE AND OF HIS MORTAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE LIVES OUT HIS ADVENTURE WITHIN THE SPAN OF HIS LIFETIME. THAT IS HIS FIELD THAT IS HIS ACTION WHICH HE SHIELDS FROM ANY JUDGMENT BUT HIS OWN. A GREATER LIFE CANNOT MEAN FOR HIM ANOTHER LIFE. THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR. I AM NOT EVEN SPEAKING HERE OF THAT PALTRY ETERNITY THAT IS CALLED POSTERITY. MME ROLAND RELIED ON HERSELF. THAT RASHNESS WAS TAUGHT A LESSON. POSTERITY IS GLAD TO QUOTE HER REMARK BUT FORGETS TO JUDGE IT. MME ROLAND IS INDIFFERENT TO POSTERITY.
    THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF HOLDING FORTH ON ETHICS. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE BEHAVE BADLY WITH GREAT MORALITY AND I NOTE EVERY DAY THAT INTEGRITY HAS NO NEED OF RULES. THERE IS BUT ONE MORAL CODE THAT THE ABSURD MAN CAN ACCEPT THE ONE THAT IS NOT SEPARATED FROM GOD: THE ONE THAT IS DICTATED. BUT IT SO HAPPENS THAT HE LIVES OUTSIDE THAT GOD. AS FOR THE OTHERS (I MEAN ALSO IMMORALISM) THE ABSURD MAN SEES NOTHING IN THEM BUT JUSTIFICATIONS AND HE HAS NOTHING TO JUSTIFY. I START OUT HERE FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF HIS INNOCENCE.
    THAT INNOCENCE IS TO BE FEARED. “EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED” EXCLAIMS IVAN KARAMAZOV. THAT TOO SMACKS OF THE ABSURD. BUT ON CONDITION THAT IT NOT BE TAKEN IN THE VULGAR SENSE. I DON’T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POINTED OUT THAT IT IS NOT AN OUTBURST OF RELIEF OR OF JOY BUT RATHER A BITTER ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A FACT. THE CERTAINTY OF A GOD GIVING A MEANING TO LIFE FAR SURPASSES IN ATTRACTIVENESS THE ABILITY TO BEHAVE BADLY WITH IMPUNITY. THE CHOICE WOULD NOT BE HARD TO MAKE. BUT THERE IS NO CHOICE AND THAT IS WHERE THE BITTERNESS COMES IN. THE ABSURD DOES NOT LIBERATE; IT BINDS. IT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ALL ACTIONS. “EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED” DOES NOT MEAN THAT NOTHING IS FORBIDDEN. THE ABSURD MERELY CONFERS AN EQUIVALENCE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE ACTIONS. IT DOES NOT RECOMMEND CRIME FOR THIS WOULD BE CHILDISH BUT IT RESTORES TO REMORSE ITS FUTILITY. LIKEWISE IF ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIFFERENT THAT OF DUTY IS AS LEGITIMATE AS ANY OTHER. ONE CAN BE VIRTUOUS THROUGH A WHIM.
    ALL SYSTEMS OF MORALITY ARE BASED ON THE IDEA THAT AN ACTION HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT LEGITIMIZE OR CANCEL IT. A MIND IMBUED WITH THE ABSURD MERELY JUDGES THAT THOSE CONSEQUENCES MUST BE CONSIDERED CALMLY. IT IS READY TO PAY UP. IN OTHER WORDS THERE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE PERSONS BUT THERE ARE NO GUILTY ONES IN ITS OPINION. AT VERY MOST SUCH A MIND WILL CONSENT TO USE PAST EXPERIENCE AS A BASIS FOR ITS FUTURE ACTIONS. TIME WILL PROLONG TIME AND LIFE WILL SERVE LIFE. IN THIS FIELD THAT IS BOTH LIMITED AND BULGING WITH POSSIBILITIES EVERYTHING IN HIMSELF EXCEPT HIS LUCIDITY SEEMS UNFORESEEABLE TO HIM. WHAT RULE THEN COULD EMANATE FROM THAT UNREASONABLE ORDER? THE ONLY TRUTH THAT MIGHT SEEM INSTRUCTIVE TO HIM IS NOT FORMAL: IT COMES TO LIFE AND UNFOLDS IN MEN. THE ABSURD MIND CANNOT SO MUCH EXPECT ETHICAL RULES AT THE END OF ITS REASONING AS RATHER ILLUSTRATIONS AND THE BREATH OF HUMAN LIVES. THE FEW FOLLOWING IMAGES ARE OF THIS TYPE. THEY PROLONG THE ABSURD REASONING BY GIVING IT A SPECIFIC ATTITUDE AND THEIR WARMTH.
    DO I NEED TO DEVELOP THE IDEA THAT AN EXAMPLE IS NOT NECESSARILY AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED (EVEN LESS SO IF POSSIBLE IN THE ABSURD WORLD) AND THAT THESE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE NOT THEREFORE MODELS? BESIDES THE FACT THAT A CERTAIN VOCATION IS REQUIRED FOR THIS ONE BECOMES RIDICULOUS WITH ALL DUE ALLOWANCE WHEN DRAWING FROM ROUSSEAU THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE MUST WALK ON ALL FOURS AND FROM NIETZSCHE THAT ONE MUST MALTREAT ONE’S MOTHER. “IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABSURD” WRITES A MODERN AUTHOR “IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO BE A DUPE.” THE ATTITUDES OF WHICH I SHALL TREAT CAN ASSUME THEIR WHOLE MEANING ONLY THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF THEIR CONTRARIES. A SUB- CLERK IN THE POST OFFICE IS THE EQUAL OF A CONQUEROR IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS COMMON TO THEM. ALL EXPERIENCES ARE INDIFFERENT IN THIS REGARD. THERE ARE SOME THAT DO EITHER A SERVICE OR A DISSERVICE TO MAN. THEY DO HIM A SERVICE IF HE IS CONSCIOUS. OTHERWISE THAT HAS NO IMPORTANCE: A MAN’S FAILURES IMPLY JUDGMENT NOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT OF HIMSELF.
    I AM CHOOSING SOLELY MEN WHO AIM ONLY TO EXPEND THEMSELVES OR WHOM I SEE TO BE EXPENDING THEMSELVES. THAT HAS NO FURTHER IMPLICATIONS. FOR THE MOMENT I WANT TO SPEAK ONLY OF A WORLD IN WHICH THOUGHTS LIKE LIVES ARE DEVOID OF FUTURE. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES MAN WORK AND GET EXCITED UTILIZES HOPE. THE SOLE THOUGHT THAT IS NOT MENDACIOUS IS THEREFORE A STERILE THOUGHT. IN THE ABSURD WORLD THE VALUE OF A NOTION OR OF A LIFE IS MEASURED BY ITS STERILITY.

DON JUANISM
    IF IT WERE SUFFICIENT TO LOVE THINGS WOULD BE TOO EASY. THE MORE ONE LOVES THE STRONGER THE ABSURD GROWS. IT IS NOT THROUGH LACK OF LOVE THAT DON JUAN GOES FROM WOMAN TO WOMAN. IT IS RIDICULOUS TO REPRESENT HIM AS A MYSTIC IN QUEST OF TOTAL LOVE. BUT IT IS INDEED BECAUSE HE LOVES THEM WITH THE SAME PASSION AND EACH TIME WITH HIS WHOLE SELF THAT HE MUST REPEAT HIS GIFT AND HIS PROFOUND QUEST. WHENCE EACH WOMAN HOPES TO GIVE HIM WHAT NO ONE HAS EVER GIVEN HIM. EACH TIME THEY ARE UTTERLY WRONG AND MERELY MANAGE TO MAKE HIM FEEL THE NEED OF THAT REPETITION. “AT LAST” EXCLAIMS ONE OF THEM “I HAVE GIVEN YOU LOVE.” CAN WE BE SURPRISED THAT DON JUAN LAUGHS AT THIS? “AT LAST? NO” HE SAYS “BUT ONCE MORE.” WHY SHOULD IT BE ESSENTIAL TO LOVE RARELY IN ORDER TO LOVE MUCH?
    IS DON JUAN MELANCHOLY? THIS IS NOT LIKELY. I SHALL BARELY HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LEGEND. THAT LAUGH THE CONQUERING INSOLENCE THAT PLAYFULNESS AND LOVE OF THE THEATER ARE ALL CLEAR AND JOYOUS. EVERY HEALTHY CREATURE TENDS TO MULTIPLY HIMSELF. SO IT IS WITH DON JUAN. BUT FURTHERMORE MELANCHOLY PEOPLE HAVE TWO REASONS FOR BEING SO: THEY DON’T KNOW OR THEY HOPE. DON JUAN KNOWS AND DOES NOT HOPE. HE REMINDS ONE OF THOSE ARTISTS WHO KNOW THEIR LIMITS NEVER GO BEYOND THEM AND IN THAT PRECARIOUS INTERVAL IN WHICH THEY TAKE THEIR SPIRITUAL STAND ENJOY ALL THE WONDERFUL EASE OF MASTERS. AND THAT IS INDEED GENIUS: THE INTELLIGENCE THAT KNOWS ITS FRONTIERS. UP TO THE FRONTIER OF PHYSICAL DEATH DON JUAN IS IGNORANT OF MELANCHOLY. THE MOMENT HE KNOWS HIS LAUGH BURSTS FORTH AND MAKES ONE FORGIVE EVERYTHING. HE WAS MELANCHOLY AT THE TIME WHEN HE HOPED. TODAY ON THE MOUTH OF THAT WOMAN HE RECOGNIZES THE BITTER AND COMFORTING TASTE OF THE ONLY KNOWLEDGE. BITTER? BARELY: THAT NECESSARY IMPERFECTION THAT MAKES HAPPINESS PERCEPTIBLE!
    IT IS QUITE FALSE TO TRY TO SEE IN DON JUAN A MAN BROUGHT UP ON ECCLESIASTES. FOR NOTHING IS VANITY TO HIM EXCEPT THE HOPE OF ANOTHER LIFE. HE PROVES THIS BECAUSE HE GAMBLES THAT OTHER LIFE AGAINST HEAVEN ITSELF. LONGING FOR DESIRE KILLED BY SATISFACTION THAT COMMONPLACE OF THE IMPOTENT MAN DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM. THAT IS ALL RIGHT FOR FAUST WHO BELIEVED IN GOD ENOUGH TO SELL HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL. FOR DON JUAN THE THING IS SIMPLER. MOLINA’S BURLADOR EVER REPLIES TO THE THREATS OF HELL: “WHAT A LONG RESPITE YOU GIVE ME!” WHAT COMES AFTER DEATH IS FUTILE AND WHAT A LONG SUCCESSION OF DAYS FOR WHOEVER KNOWS HOW TO BE ALIVE! FAUST CRAVED WORLDLY GOODS; THE POOR MAN HAD ONLY TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND. IT ALREADY AMOUNTED TO SELLING HIS SOUL WHEN HE WAS UNABLE TO GLADDEN IT. AS FOR SATIETY DON JUAN INSISTS UPON IT ON THE CONTRARY. IF HE LEAVES A WOMAN IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE HE HAS CEASED TO DESIRE HER. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IS ALWAYS DESIRABLE. BUT HE DESIRES ANOTHER AND NO THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING.
    THIS LIFE GRATIFIES HIS EVERY WISH AND NOTHING IS WORSE THAN LOSING IT. THIS MADMAN IS A GREAT WISE MAN. BUT MEN WHO LIVE ON HOPE DO NOT THRIVE IN THIS UNIVERSE WHERE KINDNESS YIELDS TO GENEROSITY AFFECTION TO VIRILE SILENCE AND COMMUNION TO SOLITARY COURAGE. AND ALL HASTEN TO SAY: “HE WAS A WEAKLING AN IDEALIST OR A SAINT.” ONE HAS TO DISPARAGE THE GREATNESS THAT INSULTS.

* * *
    PEOPLE ARE SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYED (OR THAT SMILE OF COMPLICITY THAT DEBASES WHAT IT ADMIRES) BY DON JUAN’S SPEECHES AND BY THAT SAME REMARK THAT HE USES ON ALL WOMEN. BUT TO ANYONE WHO SEEKS QUANTITY IN HIS JOYS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS EFFICACY. WHAT IS THE USE OF COMPLICATING THE PASSWORDS THAT HAVE STOOD THE TEST? NO ONE NEITHER THE WOMAN NOR THE MAN LISTENS TO THEM BUT RATHER TO THE VOICE THAT PRONOUNCES THEM. THEY ARE THE RULE THE CONVENTION AND THE COURTESY. AFTER THEY ARE SPOKEN THE MOST IMPORTANT STILL REMAINS TO BE DONE. DON JUAN IS ALREADY GETTING READY FOR IT. WHY SHOULD HE GIVE HIMSELF A PROBLEM IN MORALITY? HE IS NOT LIKE MILOSZ’S MANARA WHO DAMNS HIMSELF THROUGH A DESIRE TO BE A SAINT. HELL FOR HIM IS A THING TO BE PROVOKED. HE HAS BUT ONE REPLY TO DIVINE WRATH AND THAT IS HUMAN HONOR: “I HAVE HONOR” HE SAYS TO THE COMMANDER “AND I AM KEEPING MY PROMISE BECAUSE I AM A KNIGHT.” BUT IT WOULD BE JUST AS GREAT AN ERROR TO MAKE AN IMMORALIST OF HIM. IN THIS REGARD HE IS “LIKE EVERYONE ELSE”: HE HAS THE MORAL CODE OF HIS LIKES AND DISLIKES. DON JUAN CAN BE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY CONSTANT REFERENCE TO WHAT HE COMMONLY SYMBOLIZES: THE ORDINARY SEDUCER AND THE SEXUAL ATHLETE. HE IS AN ORDINARY SEDUCER.[16] EXCEPT FOR THE DIFFERENCE THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS AND THAT IS WHY HE IS ABSURD. A SEDUCER WHO HAS BECOME LUCID WILL NOT CHANGE FOR ALL THAT. SEDUCING IS HIS CONDITION IN LIFE. ONLY IN NOVELS DOES ONE CHANGE CONDITION OR BECOME BETTER. YET IT CAN BE SAID THAT AT THE SAME TIME NOTHING IS CHANGED AND EVERYTHING IS TRANSFORMED. WHAT DON JUAN REALIZES IN ACTION IS AN ETHIC OF QUANTITY WHEREAS THE SAINT ON THE CONTRARY TENDS TOWARD QUALITY. NOT TO BELIEVE IN THE PROFOUND MEANING OF THINGS BELONGS TO THE ABSURD MAN. AS FOR THOSE CORDIAL OR WONDER-STRUCK FACES HE EYES THEM STORES THEM UP AND DOES NOT PAUSE OVER THEM. TIME KEEPS UP WITH HIM. THE ABSURD MAN IS HE WHO IS NOT APART FROM TIME. DON JUAN DOES NOT THINK OF “COLLECTING” WOMEN. HE EXHAUSTS THEIR NUMBER AND WITH THEM HIS CHANCES OF LIFE. “COLLECTING” AMOUNTS TO BEING CAPABLE OF LIVING OFF ONE’S PAST. BUT HE REJECTS REGRET THAT OTHER FORM OF HOPE. HE IS INCAPABLE OF LOOKING AT PORTRAITS.

* * *
    IS HE SELFISH FOR ALL THAT? IN HIS WAY PROBABLY. BUT HERE TOO IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER.
    THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE MADE FOR LIVING AND THOSE WHO ARE MADE FOR LOVING. AT LEAST DON JUAN WOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY SO. BUT HE WOULD DO SO IN A VERY FEW WORDS SUCH AS HE IS CAPABLE OF CHOOSING. FOR THE LOVE WE ARE SPEAKING OF HERE IS CLOTHED IN ILLUSIONS OF THE ETERNAL. AS ALL THE SPECIALISTS IN PASSION TEACH US THERE IS NO ETERNAL LOVE BUT WHAT IS THWARTED. THERE IS SCARCELY ANY PASSION WITHOUT STRUGGLE. SUCH A LOVE CULMINATES ONLY IN THE ULTIMATE CONTRADICTION OF DEATH. ONE MUST BE WERTHER OR NOTHING. THERE TOO THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS OF COMMITTING SUICIDE ONE OF WHICH IS THE TOTAL GIFT AND FORGET-FULNESS OF SELF. DON JUAN AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE KNOWS THAT THIS CAN BE STIRRING. BUT HE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE IMPORTANT THING. HE KNOWS JUST AS WELL THAT THOSE WHO TURN AWAY FROM ALL PERSONAL LIFE THROUGH A GREAT LOVE ENRICH THEMSELVES PERHAPS BUT CERTAINLY IMPOVERISH THOSE THEIR LOVE HAS CHOSEN. A MOTHER OR A PASSIONATE WIFE NECESSARILY HAS A CLOSED HEART FOR IT IS TURNED AWAY FROM THE WORLD. A SINGLE EMOTION A SINGLE CREATURE A SINGLE FACE BUT ALL IS DEVOURED. QUITE A DIFFERENT LOVE DISTURBS DON JUAN AND THIS ONE IS LIBERATING. IT BRINGS WITH IT ALL THE FACES IN THE WORLD AND ITS TREMOR COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT KNOWS ITSELF TO BE MORTAL. DON JUAN HAS CHOSEN TO BE NOTHING.
    FOR HIM IT IS A MATTER OF SEEING CLEARLY. WE CALL LOVE WHAT BINDS US TO CERTAIN CREATURES ONLY BY REFERENCE TO A COLLECTIVE WAY OF SEEING FOR WHICH BOOKS AND LEGENDS ARE RESPONSIBLE. BUT OF LOVE I KNOW ONLY THAT MIXTURE OF DESIRE AFFECTION AND INTELLIGENCE THAT BINDS ME TO THIS OR THAT CREATURE. THAT COMPOUND IS NOT THE SAME FOR ANOTHER PERSON. I DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO COVER ALL THESE EXPERIENCES WITH THE SAME NAME. THIS EXEMPTS ONE FROM CONDUCTING THEM WITH THE SAME GESTURES. THE ABSURD MAN MULTIPLIES HERE AGAIN WHAT HE CANNOT UNIFY. THUS HE DISCOVERS A NEW WAY OF BEING WHICH LIBERATES HIM AT LEAST AS MUCH AS IT LIBERATES THOSE WHO APPROACH HIM. THERE IS NO NOBLE LOVE BUT THAT WHICH RECOGNIZES ITSELF TO BE BOTH SHORT-LIVED AND EXCEPTIONAL. ALL THOSE DEATHS AND ALL THOSE REBIRTHS GATHERED TOGETHER AS IN A SHEAF MAKE UP FOR DON JUAN THE FLOWERING OF HIS LIFE. IT IS HIS WAY OF GIVING AND OF VIVIFYING. I LET IT BE DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN SPEAK OF SELFISHNESS.

* * *
    I THINK AT THIS POINT OF ALL THOSE WHO ABSOLUTELY INSIST THAT DON JUAN BE PUNISHED. NOT ONLY IN ANOTHER LIFE BUT EVEN IN THIS ONE. I THINK OF ALL THOSE TALES LEGENDS AND LAUGHS ABOUT THE AGED DON JUAN. BUT DON JUAN IS ALREADY READY. TO A CONSCIOUS MAN OLD AGE AND WHAT IT PORTENDS ARE NOT A SURPRISE. INDEED HE IS CONSCIOUS ONLY IN SO FAR AS HE DOES NOT CONCEAL ITS HORROR FROM HIMSELF. THERE WAS IN ATHENS A TEMPLE DEDICATED TO OLD AGE. CHILDREN WERE TAKEN THERE. AS FOR DON JUAN THE MORE PEOPLE LAUGH AT HIM THE MORE HIS FIGURE STANDS OUT. THEREBY HE REJECTS THE ONE THE ROMANTICS LENT HIM. NO ONE WANTS TO LAUGH AT THAT TORMENTED PITIFUL DON JUAN. HE IS PITIED; HEAVEN ITSELF WILL REDEEM HIM? BUT THAT’S NOT IT. IN THE UNIVERSE OF WHICH DON JUAN HAS A GLIMPSE RIDICULE TOO IS INCLUDED. HE WOULD CONSIDER IT NORMAL TO BE CHASTISED. THAT IS THE RULE OF THE GAME. AND INDEED IT IS TYPICAL OF HIS NOBILITY TO HAVE ACCEPTED ALL THE RULES OF THE GAME. YET HE KNOWS HE IS RIGHT AND THAT THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF PUNISHMENT. A FATE IS NOT A PUNISHMENT.
    THAT IS HIS CRIME AND HOW EASY IT IS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE MEN OF GOD CALL DOWN PUNISHMENT ON HIS HEAD. HE ACHIEVES A KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT ILLUSIONS WHICH NEGATES EVERYTHING THEY PROFESS. LOVING AND POSSESSING CONQUERING AND CONSUMING—THAT IS HIS WAY OF KNOWING. (THERE IS SIGNIFICANCE IN THAT FAVORITE SCRIPTURAL WORD THAT CALLS THE CARNAL ACT “KNOWING.”) HE IS THEIR WORST ENEMY TO THE EXTENT THAT HE IS IGNORANT OF THEM. A CHRONICLER RELATES THAT THE TRUE BURLADOR DIED ASSASSINATED BY FRANSCISCANS WHO WANTED “TO PUT AN END TO THE EXCESSES AND BLASPHEMIES OF DON JUAN WHOSE BIRTH ASSURED HIM IMPUNITY.” THEN THEY PROCLAIMED THAT HEAVEN HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN. NO ONE HAS PROVED THAT STRANGE END. NOR HAS ANYONE PROVED THE CONTRARY. BUT WITHOUT WONDERING IF IT IS PROBABLE I CAN SAY THAT IT IS LOGICAL. I WANT MERELY TO SINGLE OUT AT THIS POINT THE WORD “BIRTH” AND TO PLAY ON WORDS: IT WAS THE FACT OF LIVING THAT ASSURED HIS INNOCENCE. IT WAS FROM DEATH ALONE THAT HE DERIVED A GUILT NOW BECOME LEGENDARY.
    WHAT ELSE DOES THAT STONE COMMANDER SIGNIFY THAT COLD STATUE SET IN MOTION TO PUNISH THE BLOOD AND COURAGE THAT DARED TO THINK? ALL THE POWERS OF ETERNAL REASON OF ORDER OF UNIVERSAL MORALITY ALL THE FOREIGN GRANDEUR OF A GOD OPEN TO WRATH ARE SUMMED UP IN HIM. THAT GIGANTIC AND SOULLESS STONE MERELY SYMBOLIZES THE FORCES THAT DON JUAN NEGATED FOREVER. BUT THE COMMANDER’S MISSION STOPS THERE. THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CAN RETURN TO THE IMITATION HEAVEN WHENCE THEY WERE CALLED FORTH. THE REAL TRAGEDY TAKES PLACE QUITE APART FROM THEM. NO IT WAS NOT UNDER A STONE HAND THAT DON JUAN MET HIS DEATH. I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN THE LEGENDARY BRAVADO IN THAT MAD LAUGHTER OF THE HEALTHY MAN PROVOKING A NON- EXISTENT GOD. BUT ABOVE ALL I BELIEVE THAT ON THAT EVENING WHEN DON JUAN WAS WAITING AT ANNA’S THE COMMANDER DIDN’T COME AND THAT AFTER MIDNIGHT THE BLASPHEMER MUST HAVE FELT THE DREADFUL BITTERNESS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RIGHT. I ACCEPT EVEN MORE READILY THE ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE THAT HAS HIM EVENTUALLY BURYING HIMSELF IN A MONASTERY. NOT THAT THE EDIFYING ASPECT OF THE STORY CAN HE CONSIDERED PROBABLE. WHAT REFUGE CAN HE GO ASK OF GOD? BUT THIS SYMBOLIZES RATHER THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF A LIFE COMPLETELY IMBUED WITH THE ABSURD THE GRIM ENDING OF AN EXISTENCE TURNED TOWARD SHORT LIVED JOYS. AT THIS POINT SENSUAL PLEASURE WINDS UP IN ASCETICISM. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO REALIZE THAT THEY MAY BE AS IT WERE THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SAME DESTITUTION. WHAT MORE GHASTLY IMAGE CAN BE CALLED UP THAN THAT OF A MAN BETRAYED BY HIS BODY WHO SIMPLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT DIE IN TIME LIVES OUT THE COMEDY WHILE AWAITING THE END FACE TO FACE WITH THAT GOD HE DOES NOT ADORE SERVING HIM AS HE SERVED LIFE KNEELING BEFORE A VOID AND ARMS OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD A HEAVEN WITHOUT ELOQUENCE THAT HE KNOWS TO HE ALSO WITHOUT DEPTH?
    I SEE DON JUAN IN A CELL OF ONE OF THOSE SPANISH MONASTERIES LOST ON A HILLTOP. AND IF HE CONTEMPLATES ANYTHING AT ALL IT IS NOT THE GHOSTS OF PAST LOVES BUT PERHAPS THROUGH A NARROW SLIT IN THE SUN- BAKED WALL SOME SILENT SPANISH PLAIN A NOBLE SOULLESS LAND IN WHICH HE RECOGNIZES HIMSELF. YES IT IS ON THIS MELANCHOLY AND RADIANT IMAGE THAT THE CURTAIN MUST BE RUNG DOWN. THE ULTIMATE END AWAITED BUT NEVER DESIRED THE ULTIMATE END IS NEGLIGIBLE.

DRAMA
    “THE PLAY’S THE THING” SAYS HAMLET “WHEREIN I’LL CATCH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE KING.”
    “CATCH” IS INDEED THE WORD. FOR CONSCIENCE MOVES SWIFTLY OR WITHDRAWS WITHIN ITSELF. IT HAS TO BE CAUGHT ON THE WING AT THAT BARELY PERCEPTIBLE MOMENT WHEN IT GLANCES FLEETINGLY AT ITSELF. THE EVERYDAY MAN DOES NOT ENJOY TARRYING. EVERYTHING ON THE CONTRARY HURRIES HIM ONWARD. BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOTHING INTERESTS HIM MORE THAN HIMSELF ESPECIALLY HIS POTENTIALITIES. WHENCE HIS INTEREST IN THE THEATER IN THE SHOW WHERE SO MANY FATES ARE OFFERED HIM WHERE HE CAN ACCEPT THE POETRY WITHOUT FEELING THE SORROW. THERE AT LEAST CAN BE RECOGNIZED THE THOUGHTLESS MAN AND HE CONTINUES TO HASTEN TOWARD SOME HOPE OR OTHER. THE ABSURD MAN BEGINS WHERE THAT ONE LEAVES OFF WHERE CEASING TO ADMIRE THE PLAY THE MIND WANTS TO ENTER IN. ENTERING INTO ALL THESE LIVES EXPERIENCING THEM IN THEIR DIVERSITY AMOUNTS TO ACTING THEM OUT. I AM NOT SAYING THAT ACTORS IN GENERAL OBEY THAT IMPULSE THAT THEY ARE ABSURD MEN BUT THAT THEIR FATE IS AN ABSURD FATE WHICH MIGHT CHARM AND ATTRACT A LUCID HEART. IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THIS IN ORDER TO GRASP WITHOUT MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT WILL FOLLOW.
    THE ACTOR’S REALM IS THAT OF THE FLEETING. OF ALL KINDS OF FAME IT IS KNOWN HIS IS THE MOST EPHEMERAL. AT LEAST THIS IS SAID IN CONVERSATION. BUT ALL KINDS OF FAME ARE EPHEMERAL. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SIRIUS GOETHE’S WORKS IN TEN THOUSAND YEARS WILL BE DUST AND HIS NAME FORGOTTEN. PERHAPS A HANDFUL OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS WILL LOOK FOR “EVIDENCE” AS TO OUR ERA. THAT IDEA HAS ALWAYS CONTAINED A LESSON. SERIOUSLY MEDITATED UPON IT REDUCES OUR PERTURBATIONS TO THE PROFOUND NOBILITY THAT IS FOUND IN INDIFFERENCE. ABOVE ALL IT DIRECTS OUR CONCERNS TOWARD WHAT IS MOST CERTAIN— THAT IS TOWARD THE IMMEDIATE. OF ALL KINDS OF FAME THE LEAST DECEPTIVE IS THE ONE THAT IS LIVED.
    HENCE THE ACTOR HAS CHOSEN MULTIPLE FAME THE FAME THAT IS HALLOWED AND TESTED. FROM THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING IS TO DIE SOMEDAY HE DRAWS THE BEST CONCLUSION. AN ACTOR SUCCEEDS OR DOES NOT SUCCEED. A WRITER HAS SOME HOPE EVEN IF HE IS NOT APPRECIATED. HE ASSUMES THAT HIS WORKS WILL BEAR WITNESS TO WHAT HE WAS. AT BEST THE ACTOR WILL LEAVE US A PHOTOGRAPH AND NOTHING OF WHAT HE WAS HIMSELF HIS GESTURES AND HIS SILENCES HIS GASPING OR HIS PANTING WITH LOVE WILL COME DOWN TO US. FOR HIM NOT TO BE KNOWN IS NOT TO ACT AND NOT ACTING IS DYING A HUNDRED TIMES WITH ALL THE CREATURES HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT TO LIFE OR RESUSCITATED.

* * *
    WHY SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED TO FIND A FLEETING FAME BUILT UPON THE MOST EPHEMERAL OF CREATIONS? THE ACTOR HAS THREE HOURS TO BE IAGO OR ALCESTE PHEDRE OR GLOUCESTER. IN THAT SHORT SPACE OF TIME HE MAKES THEM COME TO LIFE AND DIE ON FIFTY SQUARE YARDS OF BOARDS. NEVER HAS THE ABSURD BEEN SO WELL ILLUSTRATED OR AT SUCH LENGTH. WHAT MORE REVELATORY EPITOME CAN BE IMAGINED THAN THOSE MARVELOUS LIVES THOSE EXCEPTIONAL AND TOTAL DESTINIES UNFOLDING FOR A FEW HOURS WITHIN A STAGE SET? OFF THE STAGE SIGISMUNDO CEASES TO COUNT. TWO HOURS LATER HE IS SEEN DINING OUT. THEN IT IS PERHAPS THAT LIFE IS A DREAM. BUT AFTER SIGISMUNDO COMES ANOTHER. THE HERO SUFFERING FROM UNCERTAINTY TAKES THE PLACE OF THE MAN ROARING FOR HIS REVENGE. BY THUS SWEEPING OVER CENTURIES AND MINDS BY MIMING MAN AS HE CAN BE AND AS HE IS THE ACTOR HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THAT OTHER ABSURD INDIVIDUAL THE TRAVELER. LIKE HIM HE DRAINS SOMETHING AND IS CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE. HE IS A TRAVELER IN TIME AND FOR THE BEST THE HUNTED TRAVELER PURSUED BY SOULS. IF EVER THE ETHICS OF QUANTITY COULD FIND SUSTENANCE IT IS INDEED ON THAT STRANGE STAGE. TO WHAT DEGREE THE ACTOR BENEFITS FROM THE CHARACTERS IS HARD TO SAY. BUT THAT IS NOT THE IMPORTANT THING. IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF KNOWING HOW FAR HE IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH THOSE IRREPLACEABLE LIVES. IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT HE CARRIES THEM WITH HIM THAT THEY SOMEWHAT OVERFLOW THE TIME AND PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN. THEY ACCOMPANY THE ACTOR WHO CANNOT VERY READILY SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM WHAT HE HAS BEEN. OCCASIONALLY WHEN REACHING FOR HIS GLASS HE RESUMES HAMLET’S GESTURE OF RAISING HIS CUP. NO THE DISTANCE SEPARATING HIM FROM THE CREATURES INTO WHOM HE INFUSES LIFE IS NOT SO GREAT. HE ABUNDANTLY ILLUSTRATES EVERY MONTH OR EVERY DAY THAT SO SUGGESTIVE TRUTH THAT THERE IS NO FRONTIER BETWEEN WHAT A MAN WANTS TO BE AND WHAT HE IS. ALWAYS CONCERNED WITH BETTER REPRESENTING HE DEMONSTRATES TO WHAT A DEGREE APPEARING CREATES BEING. FOR THAT IS HIS ART—TO SIMULATE ABSOLUTELY TO PROJECT HIMSELF AS DEEPLY AS POSSIBLE INTO LIVES THAT ARE NOT HIS OWN. AT THE END OF HIS EFFORT HIS VOCATION BECOMES CLEAR: TO APPLY HIMSELF WHOLEHEARTEDLY TO BEING NOTHING OR TO BEING SEVERAL. THE NARROWER THE LIMITS ALLOTTED HIM FOR CREATING HIS CHARACTER THE MORE NECESSARY HIS TALENT. HE WILL DIE IN THREE HOURS UNDER THE MASK HE HAS ASSUMED TODAY. WITHIN THREE HOURS HE MUST EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESS A WHOLE EXCEPTIONAL LIFE. THAT IS CALLED LOSING ONESELF TO FIND ONESELF. IN THOSE THREE HOURS HE TRAVELS THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE DEAD-END PATH THAT THE MAN IN THE AUDIENCE TAKES A LIFETIME TO COVER.

* * *
    A MIME OF THE EPHEMERAL THE ACTOR TRAINS AND PERFECTS HIMSELF ONLY IN APPEARANCES. THE THEATRICAL CONVENTION IS THAT THE HEART EXPRESSES ITSELF AND COMMUNICATES ITSELF ONLY THROUGH GESTURES AND IN THE BODY—OR THROUGH THE VOICE WHICH IS AS MUCH OF THE SOUL AS OF THE BODY. THE RULE OF THAT ART INSISTS THAT EVERYTHING BE MAGNIFIED AND TRANSLATED INTO FLESH. IF IT WERE ESSENTIAL ON THE STAGE TO LOVE AS PEOPLE REALLY LOVE TO EMPLOY THAT IRREPLACEABLE VOICE OF THE HEART TO LOOK AS PEOPLE CONTEMPLATE IN LIFE OUR SPEECH WOULD BE IN CODE. BUT HERE SILENCES MUST MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD. LOVE SPEAKS UP LOUDER AND IMMOBILITY ITSELF BECOMES SPECTACULAR. THE BODY IS KING NOT EVERYONE CAN BE “THEATRICAL” AND THIS UNJUSTLY MALIGNED WORD COVERS A WHOLE AESTHETIC AND A WHOLE ETHIC. HALF A MAN’S LIFE IS SPENT IN IMPLYING IN TURNING AWAY AND IN KEEPING SILENT. HERE THE ACTOR IS THE INTRUDER. HE BREAKS THE SPELL CHAINING THAT SOUL AND AT LAST THE PASSIONS CAN RUSH ONTO THEIR STAGE. THEY SPEAK IN EVERY GESTURE; THEY LIVE ONLY THROUGH SHOUTS AND CRIES. THUS THE ACTOR CREATES HIS CHARACTERS FOR DISPLAY. HE OUTLINES OR SCULPTURES THEM AND SLIPS INTO THEIR IMAGINARY FORM TRANSFUSING HIS BLOOD INTO THEIR PHANTOMS. I AM OF COURSE SPEAKING OF GREAT DRAMA THE KIND THAT GIVES THE ACTOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL HIS WHOLLY PHYSICAL FATE. TAKE SHAKESPEARE FOR INSTANCE. IN THAT IMPULSIVE DRAMA THE PHYSICAL PASSIONS LEAD THE DANCE. THEY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. WITHOUT THEM ALL WOULD COLLAPSE. NEVER WOULD KING LEAR KEEP THE APPOINTMENT SET BY MADNESS WITHOUT THE BRUTAL GESTURE THAT EXILES CORDELIA AND CONDEMNS EDGAR. IT IS JUST THAT THE UNFOLDING OF THAT TRAGEDY SHOULD THENCEFORTH BE DOMINATED BY MADNESS. SOULS ARE GIVEN OVER TO THE DEMONS AND THEIR SARABAND. NO FEWER THAN FOUR MADMEN: ONE BY TRADE ANOTHER BY INTENTION AND THE LAST TWO THROUGH SUFFERING—FOUR DISORDERED BODIES FOUR UNUTTERABLE ASPECTS OF A SINGLE CONDITION.
    THE VERY SCALE OF THE HUMAN BODY IS INADEQUATE. THE MASK AND THE BUSKIN THE MAKE-UP THAT REDUCES AND ACCENTUATES THE FACE IN ITS ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS THE COSTUME THAT EXAGGERATES AND SIMPLIFIES— THAT UNIVERSE SACRIFICES EVERYTHING TO APPEARANCE AND IS MADE SOLELY FOR THE EYE. THROUGH AN ABSURD MIRACLE IT IS THE BODY THAT ALSO BRINGS KNOWLEDGE. I SHOULD NEVER REALLY UNDERSTAND IAGO UNLESS I PLAYED HIS PART. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HEAR HIM FOR I GRASP HIM ONLY AT THE MOMENT WHEN I SEE HIM. OF THE ABSURD CHARACTER THE ACTOR CONSEQUENTLY HAS THE MONOTONY THAT SINGLE OPPRESSIVE SILHOUETTE SIMULTANEOUSLY STRANGE AND FAMILIAR THAT HE CARRIES ABOUT FROM HERO TO HERO. THERE TOO THE GREAT DRAMATIC WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THIS UNITY OF TONE.[17] THIS IS WHERE THE ACTOR CONTRADICTS HIMSELF: THE SAME AND YET SO VARIOUS SO MANY SOULS SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE BODY. YET IT IS THE ABSURD CONTRADICTION ITSELF THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO WANTS TO ACHIEVE EVERYTHING AND LIVE EVERYTHING THAT USELESS ATTEMPT THAT INEFFECTUAL PERSISTENCE. WHAT ALWAYS CONTRADICTS ITSELF NEVERTHELESS JOINS IN HIM. HE IS AT THAT POINT WHERE BODY AND MIND CONVERGE WHERE THE MIND TIRED OF ITS DEFEATS TURNS TOWARD ITS MOST FAITHFUL ALLY. “AND BLEST ARE THOSE” SAYS HAMLET “WHOSE BLOOD AND JUDGMENT ARE SO WELL COMMINGLED THAT THEY ARE NOT A PIPE FOR FORTUNE’S FINGER TO SOUND WHAT STOP SHE PLEASE.”
    HOW COULD THE CHURCH HAVE FAILED TO CONDEMN SUCH A PRACTICE ON THE PART OF THE ACTOR? SHE REPUDIATED IN THAT ART THE HERETICAL MULTIPLICATION OF SOULS THE EMOTIONAL DEBAUCH THE SCANDALOUS PRESUMPTION OF A MIND THAT OBJECTS TO LIVING BUT ONE LIFE AND HURLS ITSELF INTO ALL FORMS OF EXCESS. SHE PROSCRIBED IN THEM THAT PREFERENCE FOR THE PRESENT AND THAT TRIUMPH OF PROTEUS WHICH ARE THE NEGATION OF EVERYTHING SHE TEACHES. ETERNITY IS NOT A GAME. A MIND FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PREFER A COMEDY TO ETERNITY HAS LOST ITS SALVATION. BETWEEN “EVERYWHERE” AND “FOREVER” THERE IS NO COMPROMISE. WHENCE THAT MUCH MALIGNED PROFESSION CAN GIVE RISE TO A TREMENDOUS SPIRITUAL CONFLICT. “WHAT MATTERS” SAID NIETZSCHE “IS NOT ETERNAL LIFE BUT ETERNAL VIVACITY.” ALL DRAMA IS IN FACT IN THIS CHOICE. CELIMENE AGAINST ELIANTHE THE WHOLE SUBJECT IN THE ABSURD CONSEQUENCE OF A NATURE CARRIED TO ITS EXTREME AND THE VERSE ITSELF THE “BAD VERSE” BARELY ACCENTED LIKE THE MONOTONY OF THE CHARACTER’S NATURE.
    ADRIENNE LECOUVREUR ON HER DEATHBED WAS WILLING TO CONFESS AND RECEIVE COMMUNION BUT REFUSED TO ABJURE HER PROFESSION. SHE THEREBY LOST THE BENEFIT OF THE CONFESSION. DID THIS NOT AMOUNT IN EFFECT TO CHOOSING HER ABSORBING PASSION IN PREFERENCE TO GOD? AND THAT WOMAN IN THE DEATH THROES REFUSING IN TEARS TO REPUDIATE WHAT SHE CALLED HER ART GAVE EVIDENCE OF A GREATNESS THAT SHE NEVER ACHIEVED BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS. THIS WAS HER FINEST ROLE AND THE HARDEST ONE TO PLAY. CHOOSING BETWEEN HEAVEN AND A RIDICULOUS FIDELITY PREFERRING ONESELF TO ETERNITY OR LOSING ONESELF IN GOD IS THE AGE-OLD TRAGEDY IN WHICH EACH MUST PLAY HIS PART.
    THE ACTORS OF THE ERA KNEW THEY WERE EXCOMMUNICATED. ENTERING THE PROFESSION AMOUNTED TO CHOOSING HELL. AND THE CHURCH DISCERNED IN THEM HER WORST ENEMIES. A FEW MEN OF LETTERS PROTEST: “WHAT! REFUSE THE LAST RITES TO MOLIERE!” BUT THAT WAS JUST AND ESPECIALLY IN ONE WHO DIED ONSTAGE AND FINISHED UNDER THE ACTOR’S MAKE-UP A LIFE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO DISPERSION. IN HIS CASE GENIUS IS INVOKED WHICH EXCUSES EVERYTHING. BUT GENIUS EXCUSES NOTHING JUST BECAUSE IT REFUSES TO DO SO.
    THE ACTOR KNEW AT THAT TIME WHAT PUNISHMENT WAS IN STORE FOR HIM. BUT WHAT SIGNIFICANCE COULD SUCH VAGUE THREATS HAVE COMPARED TO THE FINAL PUNISHMENT THAT LIFE ITSELF WAS RESERVING FOR HIM? THIS WAS THE ONE THAT HE FELT IN ADVANCE AND ACCEPTED WHOLLY. TO THE ACTOR AS TO THE ABSURD MAN A PREMATURE DEATH IS IRREPARABLE. NOTHING CAN MAKE UP FOR THE SUM OF FACES AND CENTURIES HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TRAVERSED. BUT IN ANY CASE ONE HAS TO DIE. FOR THE ACTOR IS DOUBTLESS EVERYWHERE BUT TIME SWEEPS HIM ALONG TOO AND MAKES ITS IMPRESSION WITH HIM.
    IT REQUIRES BUT A LITTLE IMAGINATION TO FEEL WHAT AN ACTOR’S FATE MEANS. IT IS IN TIME THAT HE MAKES UP AND ENUMERATES HIS CHARACTERS. IT IS IN TIME LIKEWISE THAT HE LEARNS TO DOMINATE THEM. THE GREATER NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIVES HE HAS LIVED THE MORE ALOOF HE CAN BE FROM THEM. THE TIME COMES WHEN HE MUST DIE TO THE STAGE AND FOR THE WORLD. WHAT HE HAS LIVED FACES HIM. HE SEES CLEARLY. HE FEELS THE HARROWING AND IRREPLACEABLE QUALITY OF THAT ADVENTURE. HE KNOWS AND CAN NOW DIE. THERE ARE HOMES FOR AGED ACTORS.

CONQUEST
    “NO” SAYS THE CONQUEROR “DON’T ASSUME THAT BECAUSE I LOVE ACTION I HAVE HAD TO FORGET HOW TO THINK. ON THE CONTRARY I CAN THROUGHLY DEFINE WHAT I BELIEVE. FOR I BELIEVE IT FIRMLY AND I SEE IT SURELY AND CLEARLY. BEWARE OF THOSE WHO SAY: ‘I KNOW THIS TOO WELL TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS IT.’ FOR IF THEY CANNOT DO SO THIS IS BECAUSE THEY DON’T KNOW IT OR BECAUSE OUT OF LAZINESS THEY STOPPED AT THE OUTER CRUST.
    “I HAVE NOT MANY OPINIONS. AT THE END OF A LIFE MAN NOTICES THAT HE HAS SPENT YEARS BECOMING SURE OF A SINGLE TRUTH. BUT A SINGLE TRUTH IF IT IS OBVIOUS IS ENOUGH TO GUIDE AN EXISTENCE. AS FOR ME I DECIDEDLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL. ONE MUST SPEAK OF HIM BLUNTLY AND IF NEED BE WITH THE APPROPRIATE CONTEMPT.
    “A MAN IS MORE A MAN THROUGH THE THINGS HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THAN THROUGH THOSE HE SAYS. THERE ARE MANY THAT I SHALL KEEP TO MYSELF. BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ALL THOSE WHO HAVE JUDGED THE INDIVIDUAL HAVE DONE SO WITH MUCH LESS EXPERIENCE THAN WE ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR JUDGMENT. THE INTELLIGENCE THE STIRRING INTELLIGENCE PERHAPS FORESAW WHAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO NOTE. BUT THE ERA ITS RUINS AND ITS BLOOD OVERWHELM US WITH FACTS. IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANCIENT NATIONS AND EVEN FOR MORE RECENT ONES DOWN TO OUR MACHINE AGE TO WEIGH ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THE VIRTUES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHICH WAS TO SERVE THE OTHER. TO BEGIN WITH THAT WAS POSSIBLE BY VIRTUE OF THAT STUBBORN ABERRATION IN MAN’S HEART ACCORDING TO WHICH HUMAN BEINGS WERE CREATED TO SERVE OR BE SERVED. IN THE SECOND PLACE IT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE NEITHER SOCIETY NOR THE INDIVIDUAL HAD YET REVEALED ALL THEIR ABILITY.
    “I HAVE SEEN BRIGHT MINDS EXPRESS ASTONISHMENT AT THE MASTERPIECES OF DUTCH PAINTERS BORN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE BLOODY WARS IN FLANDERS BE AMAZED BY THE PRAYERS OF SILESIAN MYSTICS BROUGHT UP DURING THE FRIGHTFUL THIRTY YEARS’ WAR. ETERNAL VALUES SURVIVE SECULAR TURMOILS BEFORE THEIR ASTONISHED EYES. BUT THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS SINCE. THE PAINTERS OF TODAY ARE DEPRIVED OF SUCH SERENITY. EVEN IF THEY HAVE BASICALLY THE HEART THE CREATOR NEEDS—I MEAN THE CLOSED HEART—IT IS OF NO USE; FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING THE SAINT HIMSELF IS MOBILIZED. THIS IS PERHAPS WHAT I HAVE FELT MOST DEEPLY. AT EVERY FORM THAT MISCARRIES IN THE TRENCHES AT EVERY OUTLINE METAPHOR OR PRAYER CRUSHED UNDER STEEL THE ETERNAL LOSES A ROUND. CONSCIOUS THAT I CANNOT STAND ALOOF FROM MY TIME I HAVE DECIDED TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF IT. THIS IS WHY I ESTEEM THE INDIVIDUAL ONLY BECAUSE HE STRIKES ME AS RIDICULOUS AND HUMILIATED. KNOWING THAT THERE ARE NO VICTORIOUS CAUSES I HAVE A LIKING FOR LOST CAUSES: THEY REQUIRE AN UNCONTAMINATED SOUL EQUAL TO ITS DEFEAT AS TO ITS TEMPORARY VICTORIES. FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS BOUND UP WITH THIS WORLD’S FATE THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS HAS SOMETHING AGONIZING ABOUT IT. I HAVE MADE THAT ANGUISH MINE AT THE SAME TIME THAT I WANTED TO JOIN IN. BETWEEN HISTORY AND THE ETERNAL I HAVE CHOSEN HISTORY BECAUSE I LIKE CERTAINTIES. OF IT AT LEAST I AM CERTAIN AND HOW CAN I DENY THIS FORCE CRUSHING ME?
    “THERE ALWAYS COMES A TIME WHEN ONE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CONTEMPLATION AND ACTION. THIS IS CALLED BECOMING A MAN. SUCH WRENCHES ARE DREADFUL. BUT FOR A PROUD HEART THERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISE. THERE IS GOD OR TIME THAT CROSS OR THIS SWORD. THIS WORLD HAS A HIGHER MEANING THAT TRANSCENDS ITS WORRIES OR NOTHING IS TRUE BUT THOSE WORRIES. ONE MUST LIVE WITH TIME AND DIE WITH IT OR ELSE ELUDE IT FOR A GREATER LIFE. I KNOW THAT ONE CAN COMPROMISE AND LIVE IN THE WORLD WHILE BELIEVING IN THE ETERNAL. THAT IS CALLED ACCEPTING. BUT I LOATHE THIS TERM AND WANT ALL OR NOTHING. IF I CHOOSE ACTION DON’T THINK THAT CONTEMPLATION IS LIKE AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY TO ME. BUT IT CANNOT GIVE ME EVERYTHING AND DEPRIVED OF THE ETERNAL I WANT TO ALLY MYSELF WITH TIME. I DO NOT WANT TO PUT DOWN TO MY ACCOUNT EITHER NOSTALGIA OR BITTERNESS AND I MERELY WANT TO SEE CLEARLY. I TELL YOU TOMORROW YOU WILL BE MOBILIZED. FOR YOU AND FOR ME THAT IS A LIBERATION. THE INDIVIDUAL CAN DO NOTHING AND YET HE CAN DO EVERYTHING. IN THAT WONDERFUL UNATTACHED STATE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I EXALT AND CRUSH HIM AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME. IT IS THE WORLD THAT PULVERIZES HIM AND I WHO LIBERATE HIM. I PROVIDE HIM WITH ALL HIS RIGHTS.
    “CONQUERORS KNOW THAT ACTION IS IN ITSELF USELESS. THERE IS BUT ONE USEFUL ACTION THAT OF REMAKING MAN AND THE EARTH. I SHALL NEVER REMAKE MEN. BUT ONE MUST DO ’AS IF.’ FOR THE PATH OF STRUGGLE LEADS ME TO THE FLESH. EVEN HUMILIATED THE FLESH IS MY ONLY CERTAINTY. I CAN LIVE ONLY ON IT. THE CREATURE IS MY NATIVE LAND. THIS IS WHY I HAVE CHOSEN THIS ABSURD AND INEFFECTUAL EFFORT. THIS IS WHY I AM ON THE SIDE OF THE STRUGGLE. THE EPOCH LENDS ITSELF TO THIS AS I HAVE SAID. HITHERTO THE GREATNESS OF A CONQUEROR WAS GEOGRAPHICAL. IT WAS MEASURED BY THE EXTENT OF THE CONQUERED TERRITORIES. THERE IS A REASON WHY THE WORD HAS CHANGED IN MEANING AND HAS CEASED TO SIGNIFY THE VICTORIOUS GENERAL. THE GREATNESS HAS CHANGED CAMP. IT LIES IN PROTEST AND THE BLIND-ALLEY SACRIFICE. THERE TOO IT IS NOT THROUGH A PREFERENCE FOR DEFEAT. VICTORY WOULD BE DESIRABLE. BUT THERE IS BUT ONE VICTORY AND IT IS ETERNAL. THAT IS THE ONE I SHALL NEVER HAVE. THAT IS WHERE I STUMBLE AND CLING. A REVOLUTION IS ALWAYS ACCOMPLISHED AGAINST THE GODS BEGINNING WITH THE REVOLUTION OF PROMETHEUS THE FIRST OF MODERN CONQUERORS. IT IS MAN’S DEMANDS MADE AGAINST HIS FATE; THE DEMANDS OF THE POOR ARE BUT A PRETEXT. YET I CAN SEIZE THAT SPIRIT ONLY IN ITS HISTORICAL ACT AND THAT IS WHERE I MAKE CONTACT WITH IT. DON’T ASSUME HOWEVER THAT I TAKE PLEASURE IN IT: OPPOSITE THE ESSENTIAL CONTRADICTION I MAINTAIN MY HUMAN CONTRADICTION. I ESTABLISH MY LUCIDITY IN THE MIDST OF WHAT NEGATES IT. I EXALT MAN BE-FORE WHAT CRUSHES HIM AND MY FREEDOM MY REVOLT AND MY PASSION COME TOGETHER THEN IN THAT TENSION THAT LUCIDITY AND THAT VAST REPETITION.
    “YES MAN IS HIS OWN END. AND HE IS HIS ONLY END. IF HE AIMS TO BE SOMETHING IT IS IN THIS LIFE. NOW I KNOW IT ONLY TOO WELL. CONQUERORS SOMETIMES TALK OF VANQUISHING AND OVERCOMING. BUT IT IS ALWAYS ‘OVERCOMING ONESELF’ THAT THEY MEAN. YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT THAT MEANS. EVERY MAN HAS FELT HIMSELF TO BE THE EQUAL OF A GOD AT CERTAIN MOMENTS. AT LEAST THIS IS THE WAY IT IS EXPRESSED. BUT THIS COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IN A FLASH HE FELT THE AMAZING GRANDEUR OF THE HUMAN MIND. THE CONQUERORS ARE MERELY THOSE AMONG MEN WHO ARE CONSCIOUS ENOUGH OF THEIR STRENGTH TO BE SURE OF LIVING CONSTANTLY ON THOSE HEIGHTS AND FULLY AWARE OF THAT GRANDEUR. IT IS A QUESTION OF ARITHMETIC OF MORE OR LESS. THE CONQUERORS ARE CAPABLE OF THE MORE. BUT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF NO MORE THAN MAN HIMSELF WHEN HE WANTS. THIS IS WHY THEY NEVER LEAVE THE HUMAN CRUCIBLE PLUNGING INTO THE SEETHING SOUL OF REVOLUTIONS.
    “THERE THEY FIND THE CREATURE MUTILATED BUT THEY ALSO ENCOUNTER THERE THE ONLY VALUES THEY LIKE AND ADMIRE MAN AND HIS SILENCE. THIS IS BOTH THEIR DESTITUTION AND THEIR WEALTH. THERE IS BUT ONE LUXURY FOR THEM—THAT OF HUMAN RELATIONS. HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO REALIZE THAT IN THIS VULNERABLE UNIVERSE EVERYTHING THAT IS HUMAN AND SOLELY HUMAN ASSUMES A MORE VIVID MEANING? TAUT FACES THREATENED FRATERNITY SUCH STRONG AND CHASTE FRIENDSHIP AMONG MEN—THESE ARE THE TRUE RICHES BECAUSE THEY ARE TRANSITORY. IN THEIR MIDST THE MIND IS MOST AWARE OF ITS POWERS AND LIMITATIONS. THAT IS TO SAY ITS EFFICACITY. SOME HAVE SPOKEN OF GENIUS. BUT GENIUS IS EASY TO SAY; I PREFER THE INTELLIGENCE. IT MUST BE SAID THAT IT CAN BE MAGNIFICENT THEN. IT LIGHTS UP THIS DESERT AND DOMINATES IT. IT KNOWS ITS OBLIGATIONS AND ILLUSTRATES THEM. IT WILL DIE AT THE SAME TIME AS THIS BODY. BUT KNOWING THIS CONSTITUTES ITS FREEDOM.
    “WE ARE NOT IGNORANT OF THE FACT THAT ALL CHURCHES ARE AGAINST US. A HEART SO KEYED UP ELUDES THE ETERNAL AND ALL CHURCHES DIVINE OR POLITICAL LAY CLAIM TO THE ETERNAL. HAPPINESS AND COURAGE RETRIBUTION OR JUSTICE ARE SECONDARY ENDS FOR THEM. IT IS A DOCTRINE THEY BRING AND ONE MUST SUBSCRIBE TO IT. BUT I HAVE NO CONCERN WITH IDEAS OR WITH THE ETERNAL. THE TRUTHS THAT COME WITHIN MY SCOPE CAN BE TOUCHED WITH THE HAND. I CANNOT SEPARATE FROM THEM. THIS IS WHY YOU CANNOT BASE ANYTHING ON ME: NOTHING OF THE CONQUEROR LASTS NOT EVEN HIS DOCTRINES.
    “AT THE END OF ALL THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING IS DEATH. WE KNOW ALSO THAT IT ENDS EVERYTHING. THIS IS WHY THOSE CEMETERIES ALL OVER EUROPE WHICH OBSESS SOME AMONG US ARE HIDEOUS. PEOPLE BEAUTIFY ONLY WHAT THEY LOVE AND DEATH REPELS US AND TIRES OUR PATIENCE. IT TOO IS TO BE CONQUERED. THE LAST CARRARA A PRISONER IN PADUA EMPTIED BY THE PLAGUE AND BESIEGED BY THE VENETIANS RAN SCREAMING THROUGH THE HALLS OF HIS DESERTED PALACE: HE WAS CALLING ON THE DEVIL AND ASKING HIM FOR DEATH. THIS WAS A WAY OF OVERCOMING IT. AND IT IS LIKEWISE A MARK OF COURAGE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OCCIDENT TO HAVE MADE SO UGLY THE PLACES WHERE DEATH THINKS ITSELF HONORED. IN THE REBEL S UNIVERSE DEATH EXALTS INJUSTICE. IT IS THE SUPREME ABUSE.
    “OTHERS WITHOUT COMPROMISING EITHER HAVE CHOSEN THE ETERNAL AND DENOUNCED THE ILLUSION OF THIS WORLD. THEIR CEMETERIES SMILE AMID NUMEROUS FLOWERS AND BIRDS. THAT SUITS THE CONQUEROR AND GIVES HIM A CLEAR IMAGE OF WHAT HE HAS REJECTED. HE HAS CHOSEN ON THE CONTRARY THE BLACK IRON FENCE OR THE POTTER’S FIELD. THE BEST AMONG THE MEN OF GOD OCCASIONALLY ARE SEIZED WITH FRIGHT MINGLED WITH CONSIDERATION AND PITY FOR MINDS THAT CAN LIVE WITH SUCH AN IMAGE OF THEIR DEATH. YET THOSE MINDS DERIVE THEIR STRENGTH AND JUSTIFICATION FROM THIS. OUR FATE STANDS BEFORE US AND WE PROVOKE HIM. LESS OUT OF PRIDE THAN OUT OF AWARENESS OF OUR INEFFECTUAL CONDITION. WE TOO SOMETIMES FEEL PITY FOR OURSELVES. IT IS THE ONLY COMPASSION THAT SEEMS ACCEPTABLE TO US: A FEELING THAT PERHAPS YOU HARDLY UNDERSTAND AND THAT SEEMS TO YOU SCARCELY VIRILE. YET THE MOST DARING AMONG US ARE THE ONES WHO FEEL IT. BUT WE CALL THE LUCID ONES VIRILE AND WE DO NOT WANT A STRENGTH THAT IS APART FROM LUCIDITY.”

    LET ME REPEAT THAT THESE IMAGES DO NOT PROPOSE MORAL CODES AND INVOLVE NO JUDGMENTS: THEY ARE SKETCHES. THEY MERELY REPRESENT A STYLE OF LIFE. THE LOVER THE ACTOR OR THE ADVENTURER PLAYS THE ABSURD. BUT EQUALLY WELL IF HE WISHES THE CHASTE MAN THE CIVIL SERVANT OR THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. IT IS ENOUGH TO KNOW AND TO MASK NOTHING. IN ITALIAN MUSEUMS ARE SOMETIMES FOUND LITTLE PAINTED SCREENS THAT THE PRIEST USED TO HOLD IN FRONT OF THE FACE OF CONDEMNED MEN TO HIDE THE SCAFFOLD FROM THEM. THE LEAP IN ALL ITS FORMS RUSHING INTO THE DIVINE OR THE ETERNAL SURRENDERING TO THE ILLUSIONS OF THE EVERYDAY OR OF THE IDEA—ALL THESE SCREENS HIDE THE ABSURD. BUT THERE ARE CIVIL SERVANTS WITHOUT SCREENS AND THEY ARE THE ONES OF WHOM I MEAN TO SPEAK. I HAVE CHOSEN THE MOST EXTREME ONES. AT THIS LEVEL THE ABSURD GIVES THEM A ROYAL POWER. IT IS TRUE THAT THOSE PRINCES ARE WITHOUT A KINGDOM. BUT THEY HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS: THEY KNOW THAT ALL ROYALTIES ARE ILLUSORY. THEY KNOW THAT IS THEIR WHOLE NOBILITY AND IT IS USELESS TO SPEAK IN RELATION TO THEM OF HIDDEN MISFORTUNE OR THE ASHES OF DISILLUSION. BEING DEPRIVED OF HOPE IS NOT DESPAIRING. THE FLAMES OF EARTH ARE SURELY WORTH CELESTIAL PERFUMES. NEITHER I NOR ANYONE CAN JUDGE THEM HERE. THEY ARE NOT STRIVING TO BE BETTER; THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO BE CONSISTENT. IF THE TERM “WISE MAN” CAN BE APPLIED TO THE MAN WHO LIVES ON WHAT HE HAS WITHOUT SPECULATING ON WHAT HE HAS NOT THEN THEY ARE WISE MEN. ONE OF THEM A CONQUEROR BUT IN THE REALM OF MIND A DON JUAN BUT OF KNOWLEDGE AN ACTOR BUT OF THE INTELLIGENCE KNOWS THIS BETTER THAN ANYONE: “YOU NOWISE DESERVE A PRIVILEGE ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT TO PERFECTION YOUR DEAR LITTLE MEEK SHEEP; YOU NONETHELESS CONTINUE TO BE AT BEST A RIDICULOUS DEAR LITTLE SHEEP WITH HORNS AND NOTHING MORE—EVEN SUPPOSING THAT YOU DO NOT BURST WITH VANITY AND DO NOT CREATE A SCANDAL BY POSING AS A JUDGE.”
    IN ANY CASE IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO RESTORE TO THE ABSURD REASONING MORE CORDIAL EXAMPLES. THE IMAGINATION CAN ADD MANY OTHERS INSEPARABLE FROM TIME AND EXILE WHO LIKEWISE KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN HARMONY WITH A UNIVERSE WITHOUT FUTURE AND WITHOUT WEAKNESS. THIS ABSURD GODLESS WORLD IS THEN PEOPLED WITH MEN WHO THINK CLEARLY AND HAVE CEASED TO HOPE. AND I HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN OF THE MOST ABSURD CHARACTER WHO IS THE CREATOR.

ALL THOSE LIVES MAINTAINED IN THE RAREFIED AIR OF THE ABSURD COULD NOT PERSEVERE WITHOUT SOME PROFOUND AND CONSTANT THOUGHT TO INFUSE ITS STRENGTH INTO THEM. RIGHT HERE IT CAN BE ONLY A STRANGE FEELING OF FIDELITY. CONSCIOUS MEN HAVE BEEN SEEN TO FULFILL THEIR TASK AMID THE MOST STUPID OF WARS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THEMSELVES IN CONTRADICTION. THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO ELUDE NOTHING. THERE IS THUS A METAPHYSICAL HONOR IN ENDURING THE WORLD’S ABSURDITY. CONQUEST OR PLAY-ACTING MULTIPLE LOVES ABSURD REVOLT ARE TRIBUTES THAT MAN PAYS TO HIS DIGNITY IN A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS DEFEATED IN ADVANCE.
    IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF BEING FAITHFUL TO THE RULE OF THE BATTLE. THAT THOUGHT MAY SUFFICE TO SUSTAIN A MIND; IT HAS SUPPORTED AND STILL SUPPORTS WHOLE CIVILIZATIONS. WAR CANNOT BE NEGATED. ONE MUST LIVE IT OR DIE OF IT. SO IT IS WITH THE ABSURD: IT IS A QUESTION OF BREATHING WITH IT OF RECOGNIZING ITS LESSONS AND RECOVERING THEIR FLESH. IN THIS REGARD THE ABSURD JOY PAR EXCELLENCE IS CREATION. “ART AND NOTHING BUT ART” SAID NIETZSCHE; “WE HAVE ART IN ORDER NOT TO DIE OF THE TRUTH.”
    IN THE EXPERIENCE THAT I AM ATTEMPTING TO DESCRIBE AND TO STRESS ON SEVERAL MODES IT IS CERTAIN THAT A NEW TORMENT ARISES WHEREVER ANOTHER DIES. THE CHILDISH CHASING AFTER FORGETFULNESS THE APPEAL OF SATISFACTION ARE NOW DEVOID OF ECHO. BUT THE CONSTANT TENSION THAT KEEPS MAN FACE TO FACE WITH THE WORLD THE ORDERED DELIRIUM THAT URGES HIM TO BE RECEPTIVE TO EVERYTHING LEAVE HIM ANOTHER FEVER. IN THIS UNIVERSE THE WORK OF ART IS THEN THE SOLE CHANCE OF KEEPING HIS CONSCIOUSNESS AND OF FIXING ITS ADVENTURES. CREATING IS LIVING DOUBLY. THE GROPING ANXIOUS QUEST OF A PROUST HIS METICULOUS COLLECTING OF FLOWERS OF WALLPAPERS AND OF ANXIETIES SIGNIFIES NOTHING ELSE. AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS NO MORE SIGNIFICANCE THAN THE CONTINUAL AND IMPERCEPTIBLE CREATION IN WHICH THE ACTOR THE CONQUEROR AND ALL ABSURD MEN INDULGE EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES. ALL TRY THEIR HANDS AT MIMING AT REPEATING AND AT RECREATING THE REALITY THAT IS THEIRS. WE ALWAYS END UP BY HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF OUR TRUTHS. ALL EXISTENCE FOR A MAN TURNED AWAY FROM THE ETERNAL IS BUT A VAST MIME UNDER THE MASK OF THE ABSURD. CREATION IS THE GREAT MIME.
    SUCH MEN KNOW TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN THEIR WHOLE EFFORT IS TO EXAMINE TO ENLARGE AND TO ENRICH THE EPHEMERAL ISLAND ON WHICH THEY HAVE JUST LANDED. BUT FIRST THEY MUST KNOW. FOR THE ABSURD DISCOVERY COINCIDES WITH A PAUSE IN WHICH FUTURE PASSIONS ARE PREPARED AND JUSTIFIED. EVEN MEN WITHOUT A GOSPEL HAVE THEIR MOUNT OF OLIVES. AND ONE MUST NOT FALL ASLEEP ON THEIRS EITHER. FOR THE ABSURD MAN IT IS NOT A MATTER OF EXPLAINING AND SOLVING BUT OF EXPERIENCING AND DESCRIBING. EVERYTHING BEGINS WITH LUCID INDIFFERENCE.
    DESCRIBING—THAT IS THE LAST AMBITION OF AN ABSURD THOUGHT. SCIENCE LIKEWISE HAVING REACHED THE END OF ITS PARADOXES CEASES TO PROPOUND AND STOPS TO CONTEMPLATE AND SKETCH THE EVER VIRGIN LANDSCAPE OF PHENOMENA. THE HEART LEARNS THUS THAT THE EMOTION DELIGHTING US WHEN WE SEE THE WORLD’S ASPECTS COMES TO US NOT FROM ITS DEPTH BUT FROM THEIR DIVERSITY. EXPLANATION IS USELESS BUT THE SENSATION REMAINS AND WITH IT THE CONSTANT ATTRACTIONS OF A UNIVERSE INEXHAUSTIBLE IN QUANTITY. THE PLACE OF THE WORK OF ART CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AT THIS POINT.
    IT MARKS BOTH THE DEATH OF AN EXPERIENCE AND ITS MULTIPLICATION. IT IS A SORT OF MONOTONOUS AND PASSIONATE REPETITION OF THE THEMES ALREADY ORCHESTRATED BY THE WORLD: THE BODY INEXHAUSTIBLE IMAGE ON THE PEDIMENT OF TEMPLES FORMS OR COLORS NUMBER OR GRIEF. IT IS THEREFORE NOT INDIFFERENT AS A CONCLUSION TO ENCOUNTER ONCE AGAIN THE PRINCIPAL THEMES OF THIS ESSAY IN THE WONDERFUL AND CHILDISH WORLD OF THE CREATOR. IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SEE A SYMBOL IN IT AND TO THINK THAT THE WORK OF ART CAN BE CONSIDERED AT LAST AS A REFUGE FOR THE ABSURD. IT IS ITSELF AN ABSURD PHENOMENON AND WE ARE CONCERNED MERELY WITH ITS DESCRIPTION. IT DOES NOT OFFER AN ESCAPE FOR THE INTELLECTUAL AILMENT. RATHER IT IS ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF THAT AILMENT WHICH REFLECTS IT THROUGHOUT A MAN’S WHOLE THOUGHT. BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IT MAKES THE MIND GET OUTSIDE OF ITSELF AND PLACES IT IN OPPOSITION TO OTHERS NOT FOR IT TO GET LOST BUT TO SHOW IT CLEARLY THE BLIND PATH THAT ALL HAVE ENTERED UPON. IN THE TIME OF THE ABSURD REASONING CREATION FOLLOWS INDIFFERENCE AND DISCOVERY. IT MARKS THE POINT FROM WHICH ABSURD PASSIONS SPRING AND WHERE THE REASONING STOPS. ITS PLACE IN THIS ESSAY IS JUSTIFIED IN THIS WAY.
    IT WILL SUFFICE TO BRING TO LIGHT A FEW THEMES COMMON TO THE CREATOR AND THE THINKER IN ORDER TO FIND IN THE WORK OF ART ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THOUGHT INVOLVED IN THE ABSURD. INDEED IT IS NOT SO MUCH IDENTICAL CONCLUSIONS THAT PROVE MINDS TO BE RELATED AS THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT ARE COMMON TO THEM. SO IT IS WITH THOUGHT AND CREATION. I HARDLY NEED TO SAY THAT THE SAME ANGUISH URGES MAN TO THESE TWO ATTITUDES. THIS IS WHERE THEY COINCIDE IN THE BEGINNING. BUT AMONG ALL THE THOUGHTS THAT START FROM THE ABSURD I HAVE SEEN THAT VERY FEW REMAIN WITHIN IT. AND THROUGH THEIR DEVIATIONS OR INFIDELITIES I HAVE BEST BEEN ABLE TO MEASURE WHAT BELONGED TO THE ABSURD. SIMILARLY I MUST WONDER: IS AN ABSURD WORK OF ART POSSIBLE?

* * *
    IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INSIST TOO MUCH ON THE ARBITRARY NATURE OF THE FORMER OPPOSITION BETWEEN ART AND PHILOSOPHY. IF YOU INSIST ON TAKING IT IN TOO LIMITED A SENSE IT IS CERTAINLY FALSE. IF YOU MEAN MERELY THAT THESE TWO DISCIPLINES EACH HAVE THEIR PECULIAR CLIMATE THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT REMAINS VAGUE. THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENT USED TO LIE IN THE CONTRADICTION BROUGHT UP BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHER ENCLOSED WITHIN HIS SYSTEM AND THE ARTIST PLACED BEFORE HIS WORK. BUT THIS WAS PERTINENT FOR A CERTAIN FORM OF ART AND OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH WE CONSIDER SECONDARY HERE. THE IDEA OF AN ART DETACHED FROM ITS CREATOR IS NOT ONLY OUTMODED; IT IS FALSE. IN OPPOSITION TO THE ARTIST IT IS POINTED OUT THAT NO PHILOSOPHER EVER CREATED SEVERAL SYSTEMS. BUT THAT IS TRUE IN SO FAR INDEED AS NO ARTIST EVER EXPRESSED MORE THAN ONE THING UNDER DIFFERENT ASPECTS. THE INSTANTANEOUS PERFECTION OF ART THE NECESSITY FOR ITS RENEWAL— THIS IS TRUE ONLY THROUGH A PRECONCEIVED NOTION. FOR THE WORK OF ART LIKEWISE IS A CONSTRUCTION AND EVERYONE KNOWS HOW MONOTONOUS THE GREAT CREATORS CAN BE. FOR THE SAME REASON AS THE THINKER THE ARTIST COMMITS HIMSELF AND BECOMES HIMSELF IN HIS WORK. THAT OSMOSIS RAISES THE MOST IMPORTANT OF AESTHETIC PROBLEMS. MOREOVER TO ANYONE WHO IS CONVINCED OF THE MIND’S SINGLENESS OF PURPOSE NOTHING IS MORE FUTILE THAN THESE DISTINCTIONS BASED ON METHODS AND OBJECTS. THERE ARE NO FRONTIERS BETWEEN THE DISCIPLINES THAT MAN SETS HIMSELF FOR UNDERSTANDING AND LOVING. THEY INTERLOCK AND THE SAME ANXIETY MERGES THEM.
    IT IS NECESSARY TO STATE THIS TO BEGIN WITH. FOR AN ABSURD WORK OF ART TO BE POSSIBLE THOUGHT IN ITS MOST LUCID FORM MUST BE INVOLVED IN IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOUGHT MUST NOT BE APPARENT EXCEPT AS THE REGULATING INTELLIGENCE. THIS PARADOX CAN BE EXPLAINED ACCORDING TO THE ABSURD. THE WORK OF ART IS BORN OF THE INTELLIGENCE’S REFUSAL TO REASON THE CONCRETE. IT MARKS THE TRIUMPH OF THE CARNAL. IT IS LUCID THOUGHT THAT PROVOKES IT BUT IN THAT VERY ACT THAT THOUGHT REPUDIATES ITSELF. IT WILL NOT YIELD TO THE TEMPTATION OF ADDING TO WHAT IS DESCRIBED A DEEPER MEANING THAT IT KNOWS TO BE ILLEGITIMATE. THE WORK OF ART EMBODIES A DRAMA OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUT IT PROVES THIS ONLY INDIRECTLY. THE ABSURD WORK REQUIRES AN ARTIST CONSCIOUS OF THESE LIMITATIONS AND AN ART IN WHICH THE CONCRETE SIGNIFIES NOTHING MORE THAN ITSELF. IT CANNOT BE THE END THE MEANING AND THE CONSOLATION OF A LIFE. CREATING OR NOT CREATING CHANGES NOTHING. THE ABSURD CREATOR DOES NOT PRIZE HIS WORK. HE COULD REPUDIATE IT. HE DOES SOMETIMES REPUDIATE IT. AN ABYSSINIA SUFFICES FOR THIS AS IN THE CASE OF RIMBAUD.
    AT THE SAME TIME A RULE OF AESTHETICS CAN BE SEEN IN THIS. THE TRUE WORK OF ART IS ALWAYS ON THE HUMAN SCALE. IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE ONE THAT SAYS “LESS.” THERE IS A CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GLOBAL EXPERIENCE OF THE ARTIST AND THE WORK THAT REFLECTS THAT EXPERIENCE BETWEEN WILHELM MEISTER AND GOETHE’S MATURITY. THAT RELATIONSHIP IS BAD WHEN THE WORK AIMS TO GIVE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IN THE LACE-PAPER OF AN EXPLANATORY LITERATURE. THAT RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD WHEN THE WORK IS BUT A PIECE CUT OUT OF EXPERIENCE A FACET OF THE DIAMOND IN WHICH THE INNER LUSTER IS EPITOMIZED WITHOUT BEING LIMITED. IN THE FIRST CASE THERE IS OVERLOADING AND PRETENSION TO THE ETERNAL. IN THE SECOND A FECUND WORK BECAUSE OF A WHOLE IMPLIED EXPERIENCE THE WEALTH OF WHICH IS SUSPECTED. THE PROBLEM FOR THE ABSURD ARTIST IS TO ACQUIRE THIS SAVOIR-VIVRE WHICH TRANSCENDS SAVOIR-FAIRE. AND IN THE END THE GREAT ARTIST UNDER THIS CLIMATE IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT LIVING BEING IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT LIVING IN THIS CASE IS JUST AS MUCH EXPERIENCING AS REFLECTING. THE WORK THEN EMBODIES AN INTELLECTUAL DRAMA. THE ABSURD WORK ILLUSTRATES THOUGHT’S RENOUNCING OF ITS PRESTIGE AND ITS RESIGNATION TO BEING NO MORE THAN THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WORKS UP APPEARANCES AND COVERS WITH IMAGES WHAT HAS NO REASON. IF THE WORLD WERE CLEAR ART WOULD NOT EXIST.
    I AM NOT SPEAKING HERE OF THE ARTS OF FORM OR COLOR IN WHICH DESCRIPTION ALONE PREVAILS IN ITS SPLENDID MODESTY.[18] EXPRESSION BEGINS WHERE THOUGHT ENDS. THOSE ADOLESCENTS WITH EMPTY EYESOCKETS WHO PEOPLE TEMPLES AND MUSEUMS—THEIR PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN GESTURES. FOR AN ABSURD MAN IT IS MORE EDUCATIVE THAN ALL LIBRARIES. UNDER ANOTHER ASPECT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR MUSIC. IF ANY ART IS DEVOID OF LESSONS IT IS CERTAINLY MUSIC. IT IS TOO CLOSELY RELATED TO MATHEMATICS NOT TO HAVE BORROWED THEIR GRATUITOUSNESS. THAT GAME THE MIND PLAYS WITH ITSELF ACCORDING TO SET AND MEASURED LAWS TAKES PLACE IN THE SONOROUS COMPASS THAT BELONGS TO US AND BEYOND WHICH THE VIBRATIONS NEVERTHELESS MEET IN AN INHUMAN UNIVERSE. THERE IS NO PURER SENSATION. THESE EXAMPLES ARE TOO EASY. THE ABSURD MAN RECOGNIZES AS HIS OWN THESE HARMONIES AND THESE FORMS.
    BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK HERE OF A WORK IN WHICH THE TEMPTATION TO EXPLAIN REMAINS GREATEST IN WHICH ILLUSION OFFERS ITSELF AUTOMATICALLY IN WHICH CONCLUSION IS ALMOST INEVITABLE. I MEAN FICTIONAL CREATION. I PROPOSE TO INQUIRE WHETHER OR NOT THE ABSURD CAN HOLD ITS OWN THERE.

* * *
    TO THINK IS FIRST OF ALL TO CREATE A WORLD (OR TO LIMIT ONE’S OWN WORLD WHICH COMES TO THE SAME THING). IT IS STARTING OUT FROM THE BASIC DISAGREEMENT THAT SEPARATES MAN FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO FIND A COMMON GROUND ACCORDING TO ONE’S NOSTALGIA A UNIVERSE HEDGED WITH REASONS OR LIGHTED UP WITH ANALOGIES BUT WHICH IN ANY CASE GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESCIND THE UNBEARABLE DIVORCE. THE PHILOSOPHER EVEN IF HE IS KANT IS A CREATOR. HE HAS HIS CHARACTERS HIS SYMBOLS AND HIS SECRET ACTION. HE HAS HIS PLOT ENDINGS. ON THE CONTRARY THE LEAD TAKEN BY THE NOVEL OVER POETRY AND THE ESSAY MERELY REPRESENTS DESPITE APPEARANCES A GREATER INTELLECTUALIZA- TION OF THE ART. LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT; I AM SPEAKING OF THE GREATEST. THE FECUNDITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF A LITERARY FORM ARE OFTEN MEASURED BY THE TRASH IT CONTAINS. THE NUMBER OF BAD NOVELS MUST NOT MAKE US FORGET THE VALUE OF THE BEST. THESE INDEED CARRY WITH THEM THEIR UNIVERSE. THE NOVEL HAS ITS LOGIC ITS REASONINGS ITS INTUITION AND ITS POSTULATES. IT ALSO HAS ITS REQUIREMENTS OF CLARITY.[19]
    THE CLASSICAL OPPOSITION OF WHICH I WAS SPEAKING ABOVE IS EVEN LESS JUSTIFIED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. IT HELD IN THE TIME WHEN IT WAS EASY TO SEPARATE PHILOSOPHY FROM ITS AUTHORS. TODAY WHEN THOUGHT HAS CEASED TO LAY CLAIM TO THE UNIVERSAL WHEN ITS BEST HISTORY WOULD BE THAT OF ITS REPENTANCES WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM WHEN IT IS WORTH WHILE CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM ITS AUTHOR. THE ETHICS ITSELF IN ONE OF ITS ASPECTS IS BUT A LONG AND REASONED PERSONAL CONFESSION. ABSTRACT THOUGHT AT LAST RETURNS TO ITS PROP OF FLESH. AND LIKEWISE THE FICTIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE BODY AND OF THE PASSIONS ARE REGULATED A LITTLE MORE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF A VISION OF THE WORLD. THE WRITER HAS GIVEN UP TELLING “STORIES” AND CREATES HIS UNIVERSE. THE GREAT NOVELISTS ARE PHILOSOPHICAL NOVELISTS—THAT IS THE CONTRARY OF THESIS-WRITERS. FOR INSTANCE BALZAC SADE MELVILLE STENDHAL DOSTOEVSKY PROUST MALRAUX KAFKA TO CITE BUT A FEW.
    BUT IN FACT THE PREFERENCE THEY HAVE SHOWN FOR WRITING IN IMAGES RATHER THAN IN REASONED ARGUMENTS IS REVELATORY OF A CERTAIN THOUGHT THAT IS COMMON TO THEM ALL CONVINCED OF THE USELESSNESS OF ANY PRINCIPLE OF EXPLANATION AND SURE OF THE EDUCATIVE MESSAGE OF PERCEPTIBLE APPEARANCE. THEY CONSIDER THE WORK OF ART BOTH AS AN END AND A BEGINNING. IT IS THE OUTCOME OF AN OFTEN UNEXPRESSED PHILOSOPHY ITS ILLUSTRATION AND ITS CONSUMMATION. BUT IT IS COMPLETE ONLY THROUGH THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT PHILOSOPHY. IT JUSTIFIES AT LAST THAT VARIANT OF AN OLD THEME THAT A LITTLE THOUGHT ESTRANGES FROM LIFE WHEREAS MUCH THOUGHT RECONCILES TO LIFE. INCAPABLE OF REFINING THE REAL THOUGHT PAUSES TO MIMIC IT. THE NOVEL IN QUESTION IS THE INSTRUMENT OF THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY RELATIVE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE KNOWLEDGE SO LIKE THAT OF LOVE. OF LOVE FICTIONAL CREATION HAS THE INITIAL WONDER AND THE FECUND RUMINATION.

* * *
    THESE AT LEAST ARE THE CHARMS I SEE IN IT AT THE OUTSET. BUT I SAW THEM LIKEWISE IN THOSE PRINCES OF HUMILIATED THOUGHT WHOSE SUICIDES I WAS LATER ABLE TO WITNESS.
    WHAT INTERESTS ME INDEED IS KNOWING AND DESCRIBING THE FORCE THAT LEADS THEM BACK TOWARD THE COMMON PATH OF ILLUSION. THE SAME METHOD WILL CONSEQUENTLY HELP ME HERE. THE FACT OF HAVING ALREADY UTILIZED IT WILL ALLOW ME TO SHORTEN MY ARGUMENT AND TO SUM IT UP WITHOUT DELAY IN A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE. I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER ACCEPTING A LIFE WITHOUT APPEAL ONE CAN ALSO AGREE TO WORK AND CREATE WITHOUT APPEAL AND WHAT IS THE WAY LEADING TO THESE LIBERTIES. I WANT TO LIBERATE MY UNIVERSE OF ITS PHANTOMS AND TO PEOPLE IT SOLELY WITH FLESH-AND-BLOOD TRUTHS WHOSE PRESENCE I CANNOT DENY. I CAN PERFORM ABSURD WORK CHOOSE THE CREATIVE ATTITUDE RATHER THAN ANOTHER. BUT AN ABSURD ATTITUDE IF IT IS TO REMAIN SO MUST REMAIN AWARE OF ITS GRATUITOUSNESS. SO IT IS WITH THE WORK OF ART. IF THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE ABSURD ARE NOT RESPECTED IF THE WORK DOES NOT ILLUSTRATE DIVORCE AND REVOLT IF IT SACRIFICES TO ILLUSIONS AND AROUSES HOPE IT CEASES TO BE GRATUITOUS. I CAN NO LONGER DETACH MYSELF FROM IT. MY LIFE MAY FIND A MEANING IN IT BUT THAT IS TRIFLING. IT CEASES TO BE THAT EXERCISE IN DETACHMENT AND PASSION WHICH CROWNS THE SPLENDOR AND FUTILITY OF A MAN’S LIFE.
    IN THE CREATION IN WHICH THE TEMPTATION TO EXPLAIN IS THE STRONGEST CAN ONE OVERCOME THAT TEMPTATION? IN THE FICTIONAL WORLD IN WHICH AWARENESS OF THE REAL WORLD IS KEENEST CAN I REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THE ABSURD WITHOUT SACRIFICING TO THE DESIRE TO JUDGE? SO MANY QUESTIONS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN A LAST EFFORT. IT MUST BE ALREADY CLEAR WHAT THEY SIGNIFY. THEY ARE THE LAST SCRUPLES OF AN AWARENESS THAT FEARS TO FORSAKE ITS INITIAL AND DIFFICULT LESSON IN FAVOR OF A FINAL ILLUSION. WHAT HOLDS FOR CREATION LOOKED UPON AS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE ATTITUDES FOR THE MAN CONSCIOUS OF THE ABSURD HOLDS FOR ALL THE STYLES OF LIFE OPEN TO HIM. THE CONQUEROR OR THE ACTOR THE CREATOR OR DON JUAN MAY FORGET THAT THEIR EXERCISE IN LIVING COULD NOT DO WITHOUT AWARENESS OF ITS MAD CHARACTER. ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED SO QUICKLY. A MAN WANTS TO EARN MONEY IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY AND HIS WHOLE EFFORT AND THE BEST OF A LIFE ARE DEVOTED TO THE EARNING OF THAT MONEY. HAPPINESS IS FORGOTTEN; THE MEANS ARE TAKEN FOR THE END. LIKEWISE THE WHOLE EFFORT OF THIS CONQUEROR WILL BE DIVERTED TO AMBITION WHICH WAS BUT A WAY TOWARD A GREATER LIFE. DON JUAN IN TURN WILL LIKEWISE YIELD TO HIS FATE BE SATISFIED WITH THAT EXISTENCE WHOSE NOBILITY IS OF VALUE ONLY THROUGH REVOLT. FOR ONE IT IS AWARENESS AND FOR THE OTHER REVOLT; IN BOTH CASES THE ABSURD HAS DISAPPEARED. THERE IS SO MUCH STUBBORN HOPE IN THE HUMAN HEART. THE MOST DESTITUTE MEN OFTEN END UP BY ACCEPTING ILLUSION. THAT APPROVAL PROMPTED BY THE NEED FOR PEACE INWARDLY PARALLELS THE EXISTENTIAL CONSENT. THERE ARE THUS GODS OF LIGHT AND IDOLS OF MUD. BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO FIND THE MIDDLE PATH LEADING TO THE FACES OF MAN.
    SO FAR THE FAILURES OF THE ABSURD EXIGENCE HAVE BEST INFORMED US AS TO WHAT IT IS. IN THE SAME WAY IF WE ARE TO BE INFORMED IT WILL SUFFICE TO NOTICE THAT FICTIONAL CREATION CAN PRESENT THE SAME AMBIGUITY AS CERTAIN PHILOSOPHIES. HENCE I CAN CHOOSE AS ILLUSTRATION A WORK COMPRISING EVERYTHING THAT DENOTES AWARENESS OF THE ABSURD HAVING A CLEAR STARTING-POINT AND A LUCID CLIMATE. ITS CONSEQUENCES WILL ENLIGHTEN US. IF THE ABSURD IS NOT RESPECTED IN IT WE SHALL KNOW BY WHAT EXPEDIENT ILLUSION ENTERS IN. A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE A THEME A CREATOR’S FIDELITY WILL SUFFICE THEN. THIS INVOLVES THE SAME ANALYSIS THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE AT GREATER LENGTH.
    I SHALL EXAMINE A FAVORITE THEME OF DOSTOEVSKY. I MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE STUDIED OTHER WORKS.[20] BUT IN THIS WORK THE PROBLEM IS TREATED DIRECTLY IN THE SENSE OF NOBILITY AND EMOTION AS FOR THE EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHIES ALREADY DISCUSSED. THIS PARALLELISM SERVES MY PURPOSE.

KIRILOV
    ALL OF DOSTOEVSKY’S HEROES QUESTION THEMSELVES AS TO THE MEANING OF LIFE. IN THIS THEY ARE MODERN: THEY DO NOT FEAR RIDICULE. WHAT DISTINGUISHES MODERN SENSIBILITY FROM CLASSICAL SENSIBILITY IS THAT THE LATTER THRIVES ON MORAL PROBLEMS AND THE FORMER ON METAPHYSICAL PROBLEMS. IN DOSTOEVSKY’S NOVELS THE QUESTION IS PROPOUNDED WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT IT CAN ONLY INVITE EXTREME SOLUTIONS. EXISTENCE IS ILLUSORY OR IT IS ETERNAL. IF DOSTOEVSKY WERE SATISFIED WITH THIS INQUIRY HE WOULD BE A PHILOSOPHER. BUT HE ILLUSTRATES THE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH INTELLECTUAL PASTIMES MAY HAVE IN A MAN’S LIFE AND IN THIS REGARD HE IS AN ARTIST. AMONG THOSE CONSEQUENCES HIS ATTENTION IS ARRESTED PARTICULARLY BY THE LAST ONE WHICH HE HIMSELF CALLS LOGICAL SUICIDE IN HIS DIARY OF A WRITER. IN THE INSTALLMENTS FOR DECEMBER 1876 INDEED HE IMAGINES THE REASONING OF “LOGICAL SUICIDE.” CONVINCED THAT HUMAN EXISTENCE IS AN UTTER ABSURDITY FOR ANYONE WITHOUT FAITH IN IMMORTALITY THE DESPERATE MAN COMES TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS:
    “SINCE IN REPLY TO MY QUESTIONS ABOUT HAPPINESS I AM TOLD THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I CANNOT BE HAPPY EXCEPT IN HARMONY WITH THE GREAT ALL WHICH I CANNOT CONCEIVE AND SHALL NEVER BE IN A POSITION TO CONCEIVE IT IS EVIDENT ...”
    “SINCE FINALLY IN THIS CONNECTION I ASSUME BOTH THE ROLE OF THE PLAINTIFF AND THAT OF THE DEFENDANT OF THE ACCUSED AND OF THE JUDGE AND SINCE I CONSIDER THIS COMEDY PERPETRATED BY NATURE ALTOGETHER STUPID AND SINCE I EVEN DEEM IT HUMILIATING FOR ME TO DEIGN TO PLAY IT ...”
    “IN MY INDISPUTABLE CAPACITY OF PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT OF JUDGE AND ACCUSED I CONDEMN THAT NATURE WHICH WITH SUCH IMPUDENT NERVE BROUGHT ME INTO BEING IN ORDER TO SUFFER—I CONDEMN IT TO BE ANNIHILATED WITH ME.”
    THERE REMAINS A LITTLE HUMOR IN THAT POSITION. THIS SUICIDE KILLS HIMSELF BECAUSE ON THE METAPHYSICAL PLANE HE IS VEXED. IN A CERTAIN SENSE HE IS TAKING HIS REVENGE. THIS IS HIS WAY OF PROVING THAT HE “WILL NOT BE HAD.” IT IS KNOWN HOWEVER THAT THE SAME THEME IS EMBODIED BUT WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL GENERALITY IN KIRILOV OF THE POSSESSED LIKEWISE AN ADVOCATE OF LOGICAL SUICIDE. KIRILOV THE ENGINEER DECLARES SOMEWHERE THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE BECAUSE IT “IS HIS IDEA.” OBVIOUSLY THE WORD MUST BE TAKEN IN ITS PROPER SENSE. IT IS FOR AN IDEA A THOUGHT THAT HE IS GETTING READY FOR DEATH. THIS IS THE SUPERIOR SUICIDE. PROGRESSIVELY IN A SERIES OF SCENES IN WHICH KIRILOV’S MASK IS GRADUALLY ILLUMINATED THE FATAL THOUGHT DRIVING HIM IS REVEALED TO US. THE ENGINEER IN FACT GOES BACK TO THE ARGUMENTS OF THE DIARY. HE FEELS THAT GOD IS NECESSARY AND THAT HE MUST EXIST. BUT HE KNOWS THAT HE DOES NOT AND CANNOT EXIST. “WHY DO YOU NOT REALIZE” HE EXCLAIMS “THAT THIS IS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KILLING ONESELF?” THAT ATTITUDE INVOLVES LIKEWISE FOR HIM SOME OF THE ABSURD CONSEQUENCES. THROUGH INDIFFERENCE HE ACCEPTS LETTING HIS SUICIDE BE USED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF A CAUSE HE DESPISES. “I DECIDED LAST NIGHT THAT I DIDN’T CARE.” AND FINALLY HE PREPARES HIS DEED WITH A MIXED FEELING OF REVOLT AND FREEDOM. “I SHALL KILL MYSELF IN ORDER TO ASSERT MY INSUBORDINATION MY NEW AND DREADFUL LIBERTY.” IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF REVENGE BUT OF REVOLT. KIRILOV IS CONSEQUENTLY AN ABSURD CHARACTER—YET WITH THIS ESSENTIAL RESERVATION: HE KILLS HIMSELF. BUT HE HIMSELF EXPLAINS THIS CONTRADICTION AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE REVEALS THE ABSURD SECRET IN ALL ITS PURITY. IN TRUTH HE ADDS TO HIS FATAL LOGIC AN EXTRAORDINARY AMBITION WHICH GIVES THE CHARACTER ITS FULL PERSPECTIVE: HE WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF TO BECOME GOD.
    THE REASONING IS CLASSIC IN ITS CLARITY. IF GOD DOES NOT EXIST KIRILOV IS GOD. IF GOD DOES NOT EXIST KIRILOV MUST KILL HIMSELF. KIRILOV MUST THEREFORE KILL HIMSELF TO BECOME GOD. THAT LOGIC IS ABSURD BUT IT IS WHAT IS NEEDED. THE INTERESTING THING HOWEVER IS TO GIVE A MEANING TO THAT DIVINITY BROUGHT TO EARTH. THAT AMOUNTS TO CLARIFYING THE PREMISE: “IF GOD DOES NOT EXIST I AM GOD” WHICH STILL REMAINS RATHER OBSCURE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE AT THE OUTSET THAT THE MAN WHO FLAUNTS THAT MAD CLAIM IS INDEED OF THIS WORLD. HE PERFORMS HIS GYMNASTICS EVERY MORNING TO PRESERVE HIS HEALTH. HE IS STIRRED BY THE JOY OF CHATOV RECOVERING HIS WIFE. ON A SHEET OF PAPER TO BE FOUND AFTER HIS DEATH HE WANTS TO DRAW A FACE STICKING OUT HIS TONGUE AT “THEM.” HE IS CHILDISH AND IRASCIBLE PASSIONATE METHODICAL AND SENSITIVE. OF THE SUPERMAN HE HAS NOTHING BUT THE LOGIC AND THE OBSESSION WHEREAS OF MAN HE HAS THE WHOLE CATALOGUE. YET IT IS HE WHO SPEAKS CALMLY OF HIS DIVINITY. HE IS NOT MAD OR ELSE DOSTOEVSKY IS. CONSEQUENTLY IT IS NOT A MEGALOMANIAC’S ILLUSION THAT EXCITES HIM. AND TAKING THE WORDS IN THEIR SPECIFIC SENSE WOULD IN THIS INSTANCE BE RIDICULOUS.
    KIRILOV HIMSELF HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND. IN REPLY TO A QUESTION FROM STAVROGIN HE MAKES CLEAR THAT HE IS NOT TALKING OF A GOD-MAN. IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT THIS SPRINGS FROM CONCERN TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF FROM CHRIST. BUT IN REALITY IT IS A MATTER OF ANNEXING CHRIST. KIRILOV IN FACT FANCIES FOR A MOMENT THAT JESUS AT HIS DEATH DID NOT FIND HIMSELF IN PARADISE. HE FOUND OUT THEN THAT HIS TORTURE HAD BEEN USELESS. “THE LAWS OF NATURE” SAYS THE ENGINEER “MADE CHRIST LIVE IN THE MIDST OF FALSEHOOD AND DIE FOR A FALSEHOOD.” SOLELY IN THIS SENSE JESUS INDEED PERSONIFIES THE WHOLE HUMAN DRAMA. HE IS THE COMPLETE MAN BEING THE ONE WHO REALIZED THE MOST ABSURD CONDITION. HE IS NOT THE GOD-MAN BUT THE MAN-GOD. AND LIKE HIM EACH OF US CAN BE CRUCIFIED AND VICTIMIZED—AND IS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.
    THE DIVINITY IN QUESTION IS THEREFORE ALTOGETHER TERRESTRIAL. “FOR THREE YEARS” SAYS KIRILOV “I SOUGHT THE ATTRIBUTE OF MY DIVINITY AND I HAVE FOUND IT. THE ATTRIBUTE OF MY DIVINITY IS INDEPENDENCE.” NOW CAN BE SEEN THE MEANING OF KIRILOV’S PREMISE: “IF GOD DOES NOT EXIST I AM GOD.” TO BECOME GOD IS MERELY TO BE FREE ON THIS EARTH NOT TO SERVE AN IMMORTAL BEING. ABOVE ALL OF COURSE IT IS DRAWING ALL THE INFERENCES FROM THAT PAINFUL INDEPENDENCE. IF GOD EXISTS ALL DEPENDS ON HIM AND WE CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST HIS WILL. IF HE DOES NOT EXIST EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON US. FOR KIRILOV AS FOR NIETZSCHE TO KILL GOD IS TO BECOME GOD ONESELF; IT IS TO REALIZE ON THIS EARTH THE ETERNAL LIFE OF WHICH THE GOSPEL SPEAKS.[21] BUT IF THIS METAPHYSICAL CRIME IS ENOUGH FOR MAN’S FULFILLMENT WHY ADD SUICIDE? WHY KILL ONESELF AND LEAVE THIS WORLD AFTER HAVING WON FREEDOM? THAT IS CONTRADICTORY. KIRILOV IS WELL AWARE OF THIS FOR HE ADDS: “IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE A TSAR AND FAR FROM KILLING YOURSELF YOU WILL LIVE COVERED WITH GLORY.” BUT MEN IN GENERAL DO NOT KNOW IT. THEY DO NOT FEEL “THAT.” AS IN THE TIME OF PROMETHEUS THEY ENTERTAIN BLIND HOPES.[22] THEY NEED TO BE SHOWN THE WAY AND CANNOT DO WITHOUT PREACHING. CONSEQUENTLY KIRILOV MUST KILL HIMSELF OUT OF LOVE FOR HUMANITY. HE MUST SHOW HIS BROTHERS A ROYAL AND DIFFICULT PATH ON WHICH HE WILL BE THE FIRST. IT IS A PEDAGOGICAL SUICIDE. KIRILOV SACRIFICES HIMSELF THEN. BUT IF HE IS CRUCIFIED HE WILL NOT BE VICTIMIZED. HE REMAINS THE MAN-GOD CONVINCED OF A DEATH WITHOUT FUTURE IMBUED WITH EVANGELICAL MELANCHOLY. “I” HE SAYS “AM UNHAPPY BECAUSE I AM OBLIGED TO ASSERT MY FREEDOM.”
    BUT ONCE HE IS DEAD AND MEN ARE AT LAST ENLIGHTENED THIS EARTH WILL BE PEOPLED WITH TSARS AND LIGHTED UP WITH HUMAN GLORY. KIRILOV’S PISTOL SHOT WILL BE THE SIGNAL FOR THE LAST REVOLUTION. THUS IT IS NOT DESPAIR THAT URGES HIM TO DEATH BUT LOVE OF HIS NEIGHBOR FOR HIS OWN SAKE. BEFORE TERMINATING IN BLOOD AN INDESCRIBABLE SPIRITUAL ADVENTURE KIRILOV MAKES A REMARK AS OLD AS HUMAN SUFFERING: “ALL IS WELL.”
    THIS THEME OF SUICIDE IN DOSTOEVSKY THEN IS INDEED AN ABSURD THEME. LET US MERELY NOTE BEFORE GOING ON THAT KIRILOV REAPPEARS IN OTHER CHARACTERS WHO THEMSELVES SET IN MOTION ADDITIONAL ABSURD THEMES. STAVROGIN AND IVAN KARAMAZOV TRY OUT THE ABSURD TRUTHS IN PRACTICAL LIFE. THEY ARE THE ONES LIBERATED BY KIRILOV’S DEATH. THEY TRY THEIR SKILL AT BEING TSARS. STAVROGIN LEADS AN “IRONIC” LIFE AND IT IS WELL KNOWN IN WHAT REGARD. HE AROUSES HATRED AROUND HIM. AND YET THE KEY TO THE CHARACTER IS FOUND IN HIS FAREWELL LETTER: “I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETEST ANYTHING.” HE IS A TSAR IN INDIFFERENCE. IVAN IS LIKEWISE BY REFUSING TO SURRENDER THE ROYAL POWERS OF THE MIND. TO THOSE WHO LIKE HIS BROTHER PROVE BY THEIR LIVES THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HUMILIATE ONESELF IN ORDER TO BELIEVE HE MIGHT REPLY THAT THE CONDITION IS SHAMEFUL. HIS KEY WORD IS: “EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED” WITH THE APPROPRIATE SHADE OF MELANCHOLY. OF COURSE LIKE NIETZSCHE THE MOST FAMOUS OF GOD’S ASSASSINS HE ENDS IN MADNESS. BUT THIS IS A RISK WORTH RUNNING AND FACED WITH SUCH TRAGIC ENDS THE ESSENTIAL IMPULSE OF THE ABSURD MIND IS TO ASK: “WHAT DOES THAT PROVE?”

* * *
    THUS THE NOVELS LIKE THE DIARY PROPOUND THE ABSURD QUESTION. THEY ESTABLISH LOGIC UNTO DEATH EXALTATION “DREADFUL” FREEDOM THE GLORY OF THE TSARS BECOME HUMAN. ALL IS WELL EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED AND NOTHING IS HATEFUL—THESE ARE ABSURD JUDGMENTS. BUT WHAT AN AMAZING CREATION IN WHICH THOSE CREATURES OF FIRE AND ICE SEEM SO FAMILIAR TO US. THE PASSIONATE WORLD OF INDIFFERENCE THAT RUMBLES IN THEIR HEARTS DOES NOT SEEM AT ALL MONSTROUS TO US. WE RECOGNIZE IN IT OUR EVERYDAY ANXIETIES. AND PROBABLY NO ONE SO MUCH AS DOSTOEVSKY HAS MANAGED TO GIVE THE ABSURD WORLD SUCH FAMILIAR AND TORMENTING CHARMS.
    YET WHAT IS HIS CONCLUSION? TWO QUOTATIONS WILL SHOW THE COMPLETE METAPHYSICAL REVERSAL THAT LEADS THE WRITER TO OTHER REVELATIONS. THE ARGUMENT OF THE ONE WHO COMMITS LOGICAL SUICIDE HAVING PROVOKED PROTESTS FROM THE CRITICS DOSTOEVSKY IN THE FOLLOWING INSTALLMENTS OF THE DIARY AMPLIFIES HIS POSITION AND CONCLUDES THUS: “IF FAITH IN IMMORTALITY IS SO NECESSARY TO THE HUMAN BEING (THAT WITHOUT IT HE COMES TO THE POINT OF KILLING HIMSELF) IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE NORMAL STATE OF HUMANITY. SINCE THIS IS THE CASE THE IMMORTALITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL EXISTS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT.” THEN AGAIN IN THE LAST PAGES OF HIS LAST NOVEL AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT GIGANTIC COMBAT WITH GOD SOME CHILDREN ASK ALIOCHA: “KARAMAZOV IS IT TRUE WHAT RELIGION SAYS THAT WE SHALL RISE FROM THE DEAD THAT WE SHALL SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN?” AND ALIOCHA ANSWERS: “CERTAINLY WE SHALL SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN WE SHALL JOYFULLY TELL ONE ANOTHER EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED.”
    THUS KIRILOV STAVROGIN AND IVAN ARE DEFEATED. THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV REPLIES TO THE POSSESSED. AND IT IS INDEED A CONCLUSION. ALIOCHA’S CASE IS NOT AMBIGUOUS AS IS THAT OF PRINCE MUICHKIN. ILL THE LATTER LIVES IN A PERPETUAL PRESENT TINGED WITH SMILES AND INDIFFERENCE AND THAT BLISSFUL STATE MIGHT BE THE ETERNAL LIFE OF WHICH THE PRINCE SPEAKS. ON THE CONTRARY ALIOCHA CLEARLY SAYS: “WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.” THERE IS NO LONGER ANY QUESTION OF SUICIDE AND OF MADNESS. WHAT IS THE USE FOR ANYONE WHO IS SURE OF IMMORTALITY AND OF ITS JOYS? MAN EXCHANGES HIS DIVINITY FOR HAPPINESS. “WE SHALL JOYFULLY TELL ONE ANOTHER EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED.” THUS AGAIN KIRILOV’S PISTOL RANG OUT SOMEWHERE IN RUSSIA BUT THE WORLD CONTINUED TO CHERISH ITS BLIND HOPES. MEN DID NOT UNDERSTAND “THAT.”
    CONSEQUENTLY IT IS NOT AN ABSURD NOVELIST ADDRESSING US BUT AN EXISTENTIAL NOVELIST. HERE TOO THE LEAP IS TOUCHING AND GIVES ITS NOBILITY TO THE ART THAT INSPIRES IT. IT IS A STIRRING ACQUIESCENCE RIDDLED WITH DOUBTS UNCERTAIN AND ARDENT. SPEAKING OF THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV DOSTOEVSKY WROTE: “THE CHIEF QUESTION THAT WILL BE PURSUED THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK IS THE VERY ONE FROM WHICH I HAVE SUFFERED CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALL LIFE LONG: THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.” IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A NOVEL SUFFICED TO TRANSFORM INTO JOYFUL CERTAINTY THE SUFFERING OF A LIFETIME. ONE COMMENTATOR[23] CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT DOSTOEVSKY IS ON IVAN’S SIDE AND THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE CHAPTERS TOOK THREE MONTHS OF EFFORT WHEREAS WHAT HE CALLED “THE BLASPHEMIES” WERE WRITTEN IN THREE WEEKS IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT. THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS CHARACTERS WHO DOES NOT HAVE THAT THORN IN THE FLESH WHO DOES NOT AGGRAVATE IT OR SEEK A REMEDY FOR IT IN SENSATION OR IMMORTALITY.[24] IN ANY CASE LET US REMAIN WITH THIS DOUBT. HERE IS A WORK WHICH IN A CHIAROSCURO MORE GRIPPING THAN THE LIGHT OF DAY PERMITS US TO SEIZE MAN’S STRUGGLE AGAINST HIS HOPES. HAVING REACHED THE END THE CREATOR MAKES HIS CHOICE AGAINST HIS CHARACTERS. THAT CONTRADICTION THUS ALLOWS US TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. IT IS NOT AN ABSURD WORK THAT IS INVOLVED HERE BUT A WORK THAT PROPOUNDS THE ABSURD PROBLEM.
    DOSTOEVSKY’S REPLY IS HUMILIATION “SHAME” ACCORDING TO STAVROGIN. AN ABSURD WORK ON THE CONTRARY DOES NOT PROVIDE A REPLY; THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE. LET US NOTE THIS CAREFULLY IN CONCLUSION: WHAT CONTRADICTS THE ABSURD IN THAT WORK IS NOT ITS CHRISTIAN CHARACTER BUT RATHER ITS ANNOUNCING A FUTURE LIFE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE CHRISTIAN AND ABSURD. THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF CHRISTIANS WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN A FUTURE LIFE. IN REGARD TO THE WORK OF ART IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE POSSIBLE TO DEFINE ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS OF THE ABSURD ANALYSIS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED IN THE PRECEDING PAGES. IT LEADS TO PROPOUNDING “THE ABSURDITY OF THE GOSPEL.” IT THROWS LIGHT UPON THIS IDEA FERTILE IN REPERCUSSIONS THAT CONVICTIONS DO NOT PREVENT INCREDULITY. ON THE CONTRARY IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE POSSESSED FAMILIAR WITH THESE PATHS IN CONCLUSION TOOK A QUITE DIFFERENT WAY. THE SURPRISING REPLY OF THE CREATOR TO HIS CHARACTERS OF DOSTOEVSKY TO KIRILOV CAN INDEED BE SUMMED UP THUS: EXISTENCE IS ILLUSORY AND IT IS ETERNAL.

EPHEMERAL CREATION
    AT THIS POINT I PERCEIVE THEREFORE THAT HOPE CANNOT BE ELUDED FOREVER AND THAT IT CAN BESET EVEN THOSE WHO WANTED TO BE FREE OF IT. THIS IS THE INTEREST I FIND IN THE WORKS DISCUSSED UP TO THIS POINT. I COULD AT LEAST IN THE REALM OF CREATION LIST SOME TRULY ABSURD WORKS.[25] BUT EVERYTHING MUST HAVE A BEGINNING. THE OBJECT OF THIS QUEST IS A CERTAIN FIDELITY. THE CHURCH HAS BEEN SO HARSH WITH HERETICS ONLY BECAUSE SHE DEEMED THAT THERE IS NO WORSE ENEMY THAN A CHILD WHO HAS GONE ASTRAY. BUT THE RECORD OF GNOSTIC EFFRONTERIES AND THE PERSISTENCE OF MANICHEAN CURRENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED MORE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ORTHODOX DOGMA THAN ALL THE PRAYERS. WITH DUE ALLOWANCE THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE ABSURD. ONE RECOGNIZES ONE’S COURSE BY DISCOVERING THE PATHS THAT STRAY FROM IT. AT THE VERY CONCLUSION OF THE ABSURD REASONING IN ONE OF THE ATTITUDES DICTATED BY ITS LOGIC IT IS NOT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO FIND HOPE COMING BACK IN UNDER ONE OF ITS MOST TOUCHING GUISES. THAT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE ABSURD ASCESIS. ABOVE ALL IT SHOWS THE NECESSITY OF UNFAILING ALERTNESS AND THUS CONFIRMS THE GENERAL PLAN OF THIS ESSAY.
    BUT IF IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO LIST ABSURD WORKS AT LEAST A CONCLUSION CAN BE REACHED AS TO THE CREATIVE ATTITUDE ONE OF THOSE WHICH CAN COMPLETE ABSURD EXISTENCE. ART CAN NEVER BE SO WELL SERVED AS BY A NEGATIVE THOUGHT. ITS DARK AND HUMILIATED PROCEEDINGS ARE AS NECESSARY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF A GREAT WORK AS BLACK IS TO WHITE. TO WORK AND CREATE “FOR NOTHING” TO SCULPTURE IN CLAY TO KNOW THAT ONE’S CREATION HAS NO FUTURE TO SEE ONE’S WORK DESTROYED IN A DAY WHILE BEING AWARE THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THIS HAS NO MORE IMPORTANCE THAN BUILDING FOR CENTURIES—THIS IS THE DIFFICULT WISDOM THAT ABSURD THOUGHT SANCTIONS. PERFORMING THESE TWO TASKS SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATING ON THE ONE HAND AND MAGNIFYING ON THE OTHER IS THE WAY OPEN TO THE ABSURD CREATOR. HE MUST GIVE THE VOID ITS COLORS.
    THIS LEADS TO A SPECIAL CONCEPTION OF THE WORK OF ART. TOO OFTEN THE WORK OF A CREATOR IS LOOKED UPON AS A SERIES OF ISOLATED TESTIMONIES. THUS ARTIST AND MAN OF LETTERS ARE CONFUSED. A PROFOUND THOUGHT IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF BECOMING; IT ADOPTS THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFE AND ASSUMES ITS SHAPE LIKEWISE A MAN’S SOLE CREATION IS STRENGTHENED IN ITS SUCCESSIVE AND MULTIPLE ASPECTS: HIS WORKS. ONE AFTER ANOTHER THEY COMPLEMENT ONE AN-OTHER CORRECT OR OVERTAKE ONE ANOTHER CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER TOO. IF SOMETHING BRINGS CREATION TO AN END IT IS NOT THE VICTORIOUS AND ILLUSORY CRY OF THE BLINDED ARTIST: “I HAVE SAID EVERYTHING” BUT THE DEATH OF THE CREATOR WHICH CLOSES HIS EXPERIENCE AND THE BOOK OF HIS GENIUS.
    THAT EFFORT THAT SUPERHUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS ARE NOT NECESSARILY APPARENT TO THE READER. THERE IS NO MYSTERY IN HUMAN CREATION. WILL PERFORMS THIS MIRACLE. BUT AT LEAST THERE IS NO TRUE CREATION WITHOUT A SECRET. TO BE SURE A SUCCESSION OF WORKS CAN BE BUT A SERIES OF APPROXIMATIONS OF THE SAME THOUGHT. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF ANOTHER TYPE OF CREATOR PROCEEDING BY JUXTAPOSITION. THEIR WORKS MAY SEEM TO BE DEVOID OF INTERRELATIONS. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY.
    BUT VIEWED ALL TOGETHER THEY RESUME THEIR NATURAL GROUPING. FROM DEATH FOR INSTANCE THEY DERIVE THEIR DEFINITIVE SIGNIFICANCE. THEY RECEIVE THEIR MOST OBVIOUS LIGHT FROM THE VERY LIFE OF THEIR AUTHOR. AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH THE SUCCESSION OF HIS WORKS IS BUT A COLLECTION OF FAILURES. BUT IF THOSE FAILURES ALL HAVE THE SAME RESONANCE THE CREATOR HAS MANAGED TO REPEAT THE IMAGE OF HIS OWN CONDITION TO MAKE THE AIR ECHO WITH THE STERILE SECRET HE POSSESSES.
    THE EFFORT TO DOMINATE IS CONSIDERABLE HERE. BUT HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS UP TO MUCH MORE. IT WILL MERELY INDICATE CLEARLY THE VOLUNTARY ASPECT OF CREATION. ELSEWHERE I HAVE BROUGHT OUT THE FACT THAT HUMAN WILL HAD NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS. BUT THAT COULD NOT DO WITHOUT DISCIPLINE. OF ALL THE SCHOOLS OF PATIENCE AND LUCIDITY CREATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. IT IS ALSO THE STAGGERING EVIDENCE OF MAN’S SOLE DIGNITY: THE DOGGED REVOLT AGAINST HIS CONDITION PERSEVERANCE IN AN EFFORT CONSIDERED STERILE. IT CALLS FOR A DAILY EFFORT SELF-MASTERY A PRECISE ESTIMATE OF THE LIMITS OF TRUTH MEASURE AND STRENGTH. IT CONSTITUTES AN ASCESIS. ALL THAT “FOR NOTHING” IN ORDER TO REPEAT AND MARK TIME. BUT PERHAPS THE GREAT WORK OF ART HAS LESS IMPORTANCE IN ITSELF THAN IN THE ORDEAL IT DEMANDS OF A MAN AND THE OPPORTUNITY IT PROVIDES HIM OF OVERCOMING HIS PHANTOMS AND APPROACHING A LITTLE CLOSER TO HIS NAKED REALITY.

* * *
    LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE IN AESTHETICS. IT IS NOT PATIENT INQUIRY THE UNCEASING STERILE ILLUSTRATION OF A THESIS THAT I AM CALLING FOR HERE. QUITE THE CONTRARY IF I HAVE MADE MYSELF CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. THE THESIS-NOVEL THE WORK THAT PROVES THE MOST HATEFUL OF ALL IS THE ONE THAT MOST OFTEN IS INSPIRED BY A SMUG THOUGHT. YOU DEMONSTRATE THE TRUTH YOU FEEL SURE OF POSSESSING. BUT THOSE ARE IDEAS ONE LAUNCHES AND IDEAS ARE THE CONTRARY OF THOUGHT. THOSE CREATORS ARE PHILOSOPHERS ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. THOSE I AM SPEAKING OF OR WHOM I IMAGINE ARE ON THE CONTRARY LUCID THINKERS. AT A CERTAIN POINT WHERE THOUGHT TURNS BACK ON ITSELF THEY RAISE UP THE IMAGES OF THEIR WORKS LIKE THE OBVIOUS SYMBOLS OF A LIMITED MORTAL AND REBELLIOUS THOUGHT.
    THEY PERHAPS PROVE SOMETHING. BUT THOSE PROOFS ARE ONES THAT THE NOVELISTS PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES RATHER THAN FOR THE WORLD IN GENERAL. THE ESSENTIAL IS THAT THE NOVELISTS SHOULD TRIUMPH IN THE CONCRETE AND THAT THIS CONSTITUTE THEIR NOBILITY. THIS WHOLLY CARNAL TRIUMPH HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR THEM BY A THOUGHT IN WHICH ABSTRACT POWERS HAVE BEEN HUMILIATED. WHEN THEY ARE COMPLETELY SO AT THE SAME TIME THE FLESH MAKES THE CREATION SHINE FORTH IN ALL ITS ABSURD LUSTER. AFTER ALL IRONIC PHILOSOPHIES PRODUCE PASSIONATE WORKS.
    ANY THOUGHT THAT ABANDONS UNITY GLORIFIES DIVERSITY. AND DIVERSITY IS THE HOME OF ART. THE ONLY THOUGHT TO LIBERATE THE MIND IS THAT WHICH LEAVES IT ALONE CERTAIN OF ITS LIMITS AND OF ITS IMPENDING END. NO DOCTRINE TEMPTS IT. IT AWAITS THE RIPENING OF THE WORK AND OF LIFE. DETACHED FROM IT THE WORK WILL ONCE MORE GIVE A BARELY MUFFLED VOICE TO A SOUL FOREVER FREED FROM HOPE. OR IT WILL GIVE VOICE TO NOTHING IF THE CREATOR TIRED OF HIS ACTIVITY INTENDS TO TURN AWAY. THAT IS EQUIVALENT.

* * *
    THUS I ASK OF ABSURD CREATION WHAT I REQUIRED FROM THOUGHT— REVOLT FREEDOM AND DIVERSITY. LATER ON IT WILL MANIFEST ITS UTTER FUTILITY. IN THAT DAILY EFFORT IN WHICH INTELLIGENCE AND PASSION MINGLE AND DELIGHT EACH OTHER THE ABSURD MAN DISCOVERS A DISCIPLINE THAT WILL MAKE UP THE GREATEST OF HIS STRENGTHS. THE REQUIRED DILIGENCE THE DOGGEDNESS AND LUCIDITY THUS RESEMBLE THE CONQUEROR’S ATTITUDE. TO CREATE IS LIKEWISE TO GIVE A SHAPE TO ONE’S FATE. FOR ALL THESE CHARACTERS THEIR WORK DEFINES THEM AT LEAST AS MUCH AS IT IS DEFINED BY THEM. THE ACTOR TAUGHT US THIS: THERE IS NO FRONTIER BETWEEN BEING AND APPEARING.
    LET ME REPEAT. NONE OF ALL THIS HAS ANY REAL MEANING. ON THE WAY TO THAT LIBERTY THERE IS STILL A PROGRESS TO BE MADE. THE FINAL EFFORT FOR THESE RELATED MINDS CREATOR OR CONQUEROR IS TO MANAGE TO FREE THEMSELVES ALSO FROM THEIR UNDERTAKINGS: SUCCEED IN GRANTING THAT THE VERY WORK WHETHER IT BE CONQUEST LOVE OR CREATION MAY WELL NOT BE; CONSUMMATE THUS THE UTTER FUTILITY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL LIFE. INDEED THAT GIVES THEM MORE FREEDOM IN THE REALIZATION OF THAT WORK JUST AS BECOMING AWARE OF THE ABSURDITY OF LIFE AUTHORIZED THEM TO PLUNGE INTO IT WITH EVERY EXCESS.
    ALL THAT REMAINS IS A FATE WHOSE OUTCOME ALONE IS FATAL. OUTSIDE OF THAT SINGLE FATALITY OF DEATH EVERYTHING JOY OR HAPPINESS IS LIBERTY. A WORLD REMAINS OF WHICH MAN IS THE SOLE MASTER. WHAT BOUND HIM WAS THE ILLUSION OF ANOTHER WORLD. THE OUTCOME OF HIS THOUGHT CEASING TO BE RENUNCIATORY FLOWERS IN IMAGES. IT FROLICS— IN MYTHS TO BE SURE BUT MYTHS WITH NO OTHER DEPTH THAN THAT OF HUMAN SUFFERING AND LIKE IT INEXHAUSTIBLE. NOT THE DIVINE FABLE THAT AMUSES AND BLINDS BUT THE TERRESTRIAL FACE GESTURE AND DRAMA IN WHICH ARE SUMMED UP A DIFFICULT WISDOM AND AN EPHEMERAL PASSION.

THE GODS HAD CONDEMNED SISYPHUS TO CEASELESSLY ROLLING A ROCK TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WHENCE THE STONE WOULD FALL BACK OF ITS OWN WEIGHT. THEY HAD THOUGHT WITH SOME REASON THAT THERE IS NO MORE DREADFUL PUNISHMENT THAN FUTILE AND HOPELESS LABOR.
    IF ONE BELIEVES HOMER SISYPHUS WAS THE WISEST AND MOST PRUDENT OF MORTALS. ACCORDING TO ANOTHER TRADITION HOWEVER HE WAS DISPOSED TO PRACTICE THE PROFESSION OF HIGHWAYMAN. I SEE NO CONTRADICTION IN THIS. OPINIONS DIFFER AS TO THE REASONS WHY HE BECAME THE FUTILE LABORER OF THE UNDERWORLD. TO BEGIN WITH HE IS ACCUSED OF A CERTAIN LEVITY IN REGARD TO THE GODS. HE STOLE THEIR SECRETS. ÆGINA THE DAUGHTER OF ÆSOPUS WAS CARRIED OFF BY JUPITER. THE FATHER WAS SHOCKED BY THAT DISAPPEARANCE AND COMPLAINED TO SISYPHUS. HE WHO KNEW OF THE ABDUCTION OFFERED TO TELL ABOUT IT ON CONDITION THAT ÆSOPUS WOULD GIVE WATER TO THE CITADEL OF CORINTH. TO THE CELESTIAL THUNDERBOLTS HE PREFERRED THE BENEDICTION OF WATER. HE WAS PUNISHED FOR THIS IN THE UNDERWORLD. HOMER TELLS US ALSO THAT SISYPHUS HAD PUT DEATH IN CHAINS. PLUTO COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF HIS DESERTED SILENT EMPIRE. HE DISPATCHED THE GOD OF WAR WHO LIBERATED DEATH FROM THE HANDS OF HER CONQUEROR.
    IT IS SAID ALSO THAT SISYPHUS BEING NEAR TO DEATH RASHLY WANTED TO TEST HIS WIFE’S LOVE. HE ORDERED HER TO CAST HIS UNBURIED BODY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PUBLIC SQUARE. SISYPHUS WOKE UP IN THE UNDERWORLD. AND THERE ANNOYED BY AN OBEDIENCE SO CONTRARY TO HUMAN LOVE HE OBTAINED FROM PLUTO PERMISSION TO RETURN TO EARTH IN ORDER TO CHASTISE HIS WIFE. BUT WHEN HE HAD SEEN AGAIN THE FACE OF THIS WORLD ENJOYED WATER AND SUN WARM STONES AND THE SEA HE NO LONGER WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE INFERNAL DARKNESS. RECALLS SIGNS OF ANGER WARNINGS WERE OF NO AVAIL. MANY YEARS MORE HE LIVED FACING THE CURVE OF THE GULF THE SPARKLING SEA AND THE SMILES OF EARTH. A DECREE OF THE GODS WAS NECESSARY. MERCURY CAME AND SEIZED THE IMPUDENT MAN BY THE COLLAR AND SNATCHING HIM FROM HIS JOYS LED HIM FORCIBLY BACK TO THE UNDERWORLD WHERE HIS ROCK WAS READY FOR HIM.
    YOU HAVE ALREADY GRASPED THAT SISYPHUS IS THE ABSURD HERO. HE IS AS MUCH THROUGH HIS PASSIONS AS THROUGH HIS TORTURE. HIS SCORN OF THE GODS HIS HATRED OF DEATH AND HIS PASSION FOR LIFE WON HIM THAT UNSPEAKABLE PENALTY IN WHICH THE WHOLE BEING IS EXERTED TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING. THIS IS THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID FOR THE PASSIONS OF THIS EARTH. NOTHING IS TOLD US ABOUT SISYPHUS IN THE UNDERWORLD. MYTHS ARE MADE FOR THE IMAGINATION TO BREATHE LIFE INTO THEM. AS FOR THIS MYTH ONE SEES MERELY THE WHOLE EFFORT OF A BODY STRAINING TO RAISE THE HUGE STONE TO ROLL IT AND PUSH IT UP A SLOPE A HUNDRED TIMES OVER; ONE SEES THE FACE SCREWED UP THE CHEEK TIGHT AGAINST THE STONE THE SHOULDER BRACING THE CLAY-COVERED MASS THE FOOT WEDGING IT THE FRESH START WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED THE WHOLLY HUMAN SECURITY OF TWO EARTH-CLOTTED HANDS. AT THE VERY END OF HIS LONG EFFORT MEASURED BY SKYLESS SPACE AND TIME WITHOUT DEPTH THE PURPOSE IS ACHIEVED. THEN SISYPHUS WATCHES THE STONE RUSH DOWN IN A FEW MOMENTS TOWARD THAT LOWER WORLD WHENCE HE WILL HAVE TO PUSH IT UP AGAIN TOWARD THE SUMMIT. HE GOES BACK DOWN TO THE PLAIN.
    IT IS DURING THAT RETURN THAT PAUSE THAT SISYPHUS INTERESTS ME. A FACE THAT TOILS SO CLOSE TO STONES IS ALREADY STONE ITSELF! I SEE THAT MAN GOING BACK DOWN WITH A HEAVY YET MEASURED STEP TOWARD THE TORMENT OF WHICH HE WILL NEVER KNOW THE END. THAT HOUR LIKE A BREATHING-SPACE WHICH RETURNS AS SURELY AS HIS SUFFERING THAT IS THE HOUR OF CONSCIOUSNESS. AT EACH OF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN HE LEAVES THE HEIGHTS AND GRADUALLY SINKS TOWARD THE LAIRS OF THE GODS HE IS SUPERIOR TO HIS FATE. HE IS STRONGER THAN HIS ROCK.
    IF THIS MYTH IS TRAGIC THAT IS BECAUSE ITS HERO IS CONSCIOUS. WHERE WOULD HIS TORTURE BE INDEED IF AT EVERY STEP THE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING UPHELD HIM? THE WORKMAN OF TODAY WORKS EVERY DAY IN HIS LIFE AT THE SAME TASKS AND THIS FATE IS NO LESS ABSURD. BUT IT IS TRAGIC ONLY AT THE RARE MOMENTS WHEN IT BECOMES CONSCIOUS. SISYPHUS PROLETARIAN OF THE GODS POWERLESS AND REBELLIOUS KNOWS THE WHOLE EXTENT OF HIS WRETCHED CONDITION: IT IS WHAT HE THINKS OF DURING HIS DESCENT. THE LUCIDITY THAT WAS TO CONSTITUTE HIS TORTURE AT THE SAME TIME CROWNS HIS VICTORY. THERE IS NO FATE THAT CANNOT BE SURMOUNTED BY SCORN.

* * *
    IF THE DESCENT IS THUS SOMETIMES PERFORMED IN SORROW IT CAN ALSO TAKE PLACE IN JOY. THIS WORD IS NOT TOO MUCH. AGAIN I FANCY SISYPHUS RETURNING TOWARD HIS ROCK AND THE SORROW WAS IN THE BEGINNING. WHEN THE IMAGES OF EARTH CLING TOO TIGHTLY TO MEMORY WHEN THE CALL OF HAPPINESS BECOMES TOO INSISTENT IT HAPPENS THAT MELANCHOLY RISES IN MAN’S HEART: THIS IS THE ROCK’S VICTORY THIS IS THE ROCK ITSELF. THE BOUNDLESS GRIEF IS TOO HEAVY TO BEAR. THESE ARE OUR NIGHTS OF GETHSEMANE. BUT CRUSHING TRUTHS PERISH FROM BEING ACKNOWLEDGED. THUS ŒDIPUS AT THE OUTSET OBEYS FATE WITHOUT KNOWING IT. BUT FROM THE MOMENT HE KNOWS HIS TRAGEDY BEGINS. YET AT THE SAME MOMENT BLIND AND DESPERATE HE REALIZES THAT THE ONLY BOND LINKING HIM TO THE WORLD IS THE COOL HAND OF A GIRL. THEN A TREMENDOUS REMARK RINGS OUT: “DESPITE SO MANY ORDEALS MY ADVANCED AGE AND THE NOBILITY OF MY SOUL MAKE ME CONCLUDE THAT ALL IS WELL.” SOPHOCLES’ ŒDIPUS LIKE DOSTOEVSKY’S KIRILOV THUS GIVES THE RECIPE FOR THE ABSURD VICTORY. ANCIENT WISDOM CONFIRMS MODERN HEROISM.
    ONE DOES NOT DISCOVER THE ABSURD WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO WRITE A MANUAL OF HAPPINESS. “WHAT! BY SUCH NARROW WAYS—?” THERE IS BUT ONE WORLD HOWEVER. HAPPINESS AND THE ABSURD ARE TWO SONS OF THE SAME EARTH. THEY ARE INSEPARABLE. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT HAPPINESS NECESSARILY SPRINGS FROM THE ABSURD DISCOVERY. IT HAPPENS AS WELL THAT THE FEELING OF THE ABSURD SPRINGS FROM HAPPINESS. “I CONCLUDE THAT ALL IS WELL” SAYS ŒDIPUS AND THAT REMARK IS SACRED. IT ECHOES IN THE WILD AND LIMITED UNIVERSE OF MAN. IT TEACHES THAT ALL IS NOT HAS NOT BEEN EXHAUSTED. IT DRIVES OUT OF THIS WORLD A GOD WHO HAD COME INTO IT WITH DISSATISFACTION AND A PREFERENCE FOR FUTILE SUFFERINGS. IT MAKES OF FATE A HUMAN MATTER WHICH MUST BE SETTLED AMONG MEN.
    ALL SISYPHUS’ SILENT JOY IS CONTAINED THEREIN. HIS FATE BELONGS TO HIM. HIS ROCK IS HIS THING. LIKEWISE THE ABSURD MAN WHEN HE CONTEMPLATES HIS TORMENT SILENCES ALL THE IDOLS. IN THE UNIVERSE SUDDENLY RESTORED TO ITS SILENCE THE MYRIAD WONDERING LITTLE VOICES OF THE EARTH RISE UP. UNCONSCIOUS SECRET CALLS INVITATIONS FROM ALL THE FACES THEY ARE THE NECESSARY REVERSE AND PRICE OF VICTORY. THERE IS NO SUN WITHOUT SHADOW AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW THE NIGHT. THE ABSURD MAN SAYS YES AND HIS EFFORT WILL HENCEFORTH BE UNCEASING. IF THERE IS A PERSONAL FATE THERE IS NO HIGHER DESTINY OR AT LEAST THERE IS BUT ONE WHICH HE CONCLUDES IS INEVITABLE AND DESPICABLE. FOR THE REST HE KNOWS HIMSELF TO BE THE MASTER OF HIS DAYS. AT THAT SUBTLE MOMENT WHEN MAN GLANCES BACKWARD OVER HIS LIFE SISYPHUS RETURNING TOWARD HIS ROCK IN THAT SLIGHT PIVOTING HE CONTEMPLATES THAT SERIES OF UNRELATED ACTIONS WHICH BECOMES HIS FATE CREATED BY HIM COMBINED UNDER HIS MEMORY’S EYE AND SOON SEALED BY HIS DEATH. THUS CONVINCED OF THE WHOLLY HUMAN ORIGIN OF ALL THAT IS HUMAN A BLIND MAN EAGER TO SEE WHO KNOWS THAT THE NIGHT HAS NO END HE IS STILL ON THE GO. THE ROCK IS STILL ROLLING.
    I LEAVE SISYPHUS AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN! ONE ALWAYS FINDS ONE’S BURDEN AGAIN. BUT SISYPHUS TEACHES THE HIGHER FIDELITY THAT NEGATES THE GODS AND RAISES ROCKS. HE TOO CONCLUDES THAT ALL IS WELL. THIS UNIVERSE HENCEFORTH WITHOUT A MASTER SEEMS TO HIM NEITHER STERILE NOR FUTILE. EACH ATOM OF THAT STONE EACH MINERAL FLAKE OF THAT NIGHT-FILLED MOUNTAIN IN ITSELF FORMS A WORLD. THE STRUGGLE ITSELF TOWARD THE HEIGHTS IS ENOUGH TO FILL A MAN’S HEART. ONE MUST IMAGINE SISYPHUS HAPPY.

THE LOVES WE SHARE WITH A CITY ARE OFTEN SECRET LOVES. OLD WALLED TOWNS LIKE PARIS PRAGUE AND EVEN FLORENCE ARE CLOSED IN ON THEMSELVES AND HENCE LIMIT THE WORLD THAT BELONGS TO THEM. BUT ALGIERS (TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN OTHER PRIVILEGED PLACES SUCH AS CITIES ON THE SEA) OPENS TO THE SKY LIKE A MOUTH OR A WOUND. IN ALGIERS ONE LOVES THE COMMONPLACES: THE SEA AT THE END OF EVERY STREET A CERTAIN VOLUME OF SUNLIGHT THE BEAUTY OF THE RACE. AND AS ALWAYS IN THAT UNASHAMED OFFERING THERE IS A SECRET FRAGRANCE. IN PARIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE HOMESICK FOR SPACE AND A BEATING OF WINGS. HERE AT LEAST MAN IS GRATIFIED IN EVERY WISH AND SURE OF HIS DESIRES CAN AT LAST MEASURE HIS POSSESSIONS.
    PROBABLY ONE HAS TO LIVE IN ALGIERS FOR SOME TIME IN ORDER TO REALIZE HOW PARALYZING AN EXCESS OF NATURE’S BOUNTY CAN BE. THERE IS NOTHING HERE FOR WHOEVER WOULD LEARN EDUCATE HIMSELF OR BETTER HIMSELF. THIS COUNTRY HAS NO LESSONS TO TEACH. IT NEITHER PROMISES NOR AFFORDS GLIMPSES. IT IS SATISFIED TO GIVE BUT IN ABUNDANCE. IT IS COMPLETELY ACCESSIBLE TO THE EYES AND YOU KNOW IT THE MOMENT YOU ENJOY IT. ITS PLEASURES ARE WITHOUT REMEDY AND ITS JOYS WITHOUT HOPE. ABOVE ALL IT REQUIRES CLAIRVOYANT SOULS—THAT IS WITHOUT SOLACE. IT INSISTS UPON ONE’S PERFORMING AN ACT OF LUCIDITY AS ONE PERFORMS AN ACT OF FAITH. STRANGE COUNTRY THAT GIVES THE MAN IT NOURISHES BOTH HIS SPLENDOR AND HIS MISERY! IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE SENSUAL RICHES GRANTED TO A SENSITIVE MAN OF THESE REGIONS SHOULD COINCIDE WITH THE MOST EXTREME DESTITUTION. NO TRUTH FAILS TO CARRY WITH IT ITS BITTERNESS. HOW CAN ONE BE SURPRISED THEN IF I NEVER FEEL MORE AFFECTION FOR THE FACE OF THIS COUNTRY THAN AMID ITS POOREST MEN?
    DURING THEIR ENTIRE YOUTH MEN FIND HERE A LIFE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BEAUTY. THEN LATER ON THE DOWNHILL SLOPE AND OBSCURITY. THEY WAGERED ON THE FLESH BUT KNOWING THEY WERE TO LOSE. IN ALGIERS WHOEVER IS YOUNG AND ALIVE FINDS SANCTUARY AND OCCASION FOR TRIUMPHS EVERYWHERE: IN THE BAY THE SUN THE RED AND WHITE GAMES ON THE SEAWARD TERRACES THE FLOWERS AND SPORTS STADIUMS THE COOL- LEGGED GIRLS. BUT FOR WHOEVER HAS LOST HIS YOUTH THERE IS NOTHING TO CLING TO AND NOWHERE WHERE MELANCHOLY CAN ESCAPE ITSELF. ELSEWHERE ITALIAN TERRACES EUROPEAN CLOISTERS OR THE PROFILE OF THE PROVENCAL HILLS—ALL PLACES WHERE MAN CAN FLEE HIS HUMANITY AND GENTLY LIBERATE HIMSELF FROM HIMSELF. BUT EVERYTHING HERE CALLS FOR SOLITUDE AND THE BLOOD OF YOUNG MEN. GOETHE ON HIS DEATHBED CALLS FOR LIGHT AND THIS IS A HISTORIC REMARK. AT BELCOURT AND BAB-EL-OUED OLD MEN SEATED IN THE DEPTHS OF CAFES LISTEN TO THE BRAGGING OF YOUNG MEN WITH PLASTERED HAIR.
    SUMMER BETRAYS THESE BEGINNINGS AND ENDS TO US IN ALGIERS. DURING THOSE MONTHS THE CITY IS DESERTED. BUT THE POOR REMAIN AND THE SKY. WE JOIN THE FORMER AS THEY GO DOWN TOWARD THE HARBOR AND MAN’S TREASURES: WARMTH OF THE WATER AND THE BROWN BODIES OF WOMEN. IN THE EVENING SATED WITH SUCH WEALTH THEY RETURN TO THE OILCLOTH AND KEROSENE LAMP THAT CONSTITUTE THE WHOLE SETTING OF THEIR LIFE.
    IN ALGIERS NO ONE SAYS “GO FOR A SWIM” BUT RATHER “INDULGE IN A SWIM.” THE IMPLICATIONS ARE CLEAR. PEOPLE SWIM IN THE HARBOR AND GO TO REST ON THE BUOYS. ANYONE WHO PASSES NEAR A BUOY WHERE A PRETTY GIRL ALREADY IS SUNNING HERSELF SHOUTS TO HIS FRIENDS: “I TELL YOU IT’S A SEAGULL.” THESE ARE HEALTHY AMUSEMENTS. THEY MUST OBVIOUSLY CONSTITUTE THE IDEAL OF THOSE YOUTHS SINCE MOST OF THEM CONTINUE THE SAME LIFE IN THE WINTER UNDRESSING EVERY DAY AT NOON FOR A FRUGAL LUNCH IN THE SUN. NOT THAT THEY HAVE READ THE BORING SERMONS OF THE NUDISTS THOSE PROTESTANTS OF THE FLESH (THERE IS A THEORY OF THE BODY QUITE AS TIRESOME AS THAT OF THE MIND). BUT THEY ARE SIMPLY “COMFORTABLE IN THE SUNLIGHT.” THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CUSTOM FOR OUR EPOCH CAN NEVER BE OVERESTIMATED. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS THE BODY HAS APPEARED NAKED ON BEACHES. FOR TWENTY CENTURIES MEN HAVE STRIVEN TO GIVE DECENCY TO GREEK INSOLENCE AND NAIVETE TO DIMINISH THE FLESH AND COMPLICATE DRESS. TODAY DESPITE THAT HISTORY YOUNG MEN RUNNING ON MEDITERRANEAN BEACHES REPEAT THE GESTURES OF THE ATHLETES OF DELOS. AND LIVING THUS AMONG BODIES AND THROUGH ONE’S BODY ONE BECOMES AWARE THAT IT HAS ITS CONNOTATIONS ITS LIFE AND TO RISK NONSENSE A PSYCHOLOGY OF ITS OWN.[33] THE BODY’S EVOLUTION LIKE THAT OF THE MIND HAS ITS HISTORY ITS VICISSITUDES ITS PROGRESS AND ITS DEFICIENCY. WITH THIS DISTINCTION HOWEVER: COLOR. WHEN YOU FREQUENT THE BEACH IN SUMMER YOU BECOME AWARE OF A SIMULTANEOUS PROGRESSION OF ALL SKINS FROM WHITE TO GOLDEN TO TANNED ENDING UP IN A TOBACCO COLOR WHICH MARKS THE EXTREME LIMIT OF THE EFFORT OF TRANSFORMATION OF WHICH THE BODY IS CAPABLE. ABOVE THE HARBOR STANDS THE SET OF WHITE CUBES OF THE KASBAH. WHEN YOU ARE AT WATER LEVEL AGAINST THE SHARP WHILE BACKGROUND OF THE ARAB TOWN THE BODIES DESCRIBE A COPPER-COLORED FRIEZE. AND AS THE MONTH OF AUGUST PROGRESSES AND THE SUN GROWS THE WHITE OF THE HOUSES BECOMES MORE BLINDING AND SKINS TAKE ON A DARKER WARMTH. HOW CAN ONE FAIL TO PARTICIPATE THEN IN THAT DIALOGUE OF STONE AND FLESH IN TUNE WITH THE SUN AND SEASONS? THE WHOLE MORNING HAS BEEN SPENT IN DIVING IN BURSTS OF LAUGHTER AMID SPLASHING WATER IN VIGOROUS PADDLES AROUND THE RED AND BLACK FREIGHTERS (THOSE FROM NORWAY WITH ALL THE SCENTS OF WOOD THOSE THAT COME FROM GERMANY FULL OF THE SMELL OF OIL THOSE THAT GO UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND SMELL OF WINE AND OLD CASKS). AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN OVERFLOWS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE SKY AT ONCE THE ORANGE CANOE LOADED WITH BROWN BODIES BRINGS US HOME IN A MAD RACE. AND WHEN HAVING SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED THE CADENCED BEAT OF THE DOUBLE PADDLE’S BRIGHT-COLORED WINGS WE GLIDE SLOWLY IN THE CALM WATER OF THE INNER HARBOR HOW CAN I FAIL TO FEEL THAT I AM PILOTING THROUGH THE SMOOTH WATERS A SAVAGE CARGO OF GODS IN WHOM I RECOGNIZE MY BROTHERS?
    BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE CITY SUMMER IS ALREADY OFFERING US BY WAY OF CONTRAST ITS OTHER RICHES: I MEAN ITS SILENCE AND ITS BOREDOM. THAT SILENCE IS NOT ALWAYS OF THE SAME QUALITY DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT SPRINGS FROM THE SHADE OR THE SUNLIGHT. THERE IS THE SILENCE OF NOON ON THE PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT. IN THE SHADE OF THE TREES SURROUNDING IT ARABS SELL FOR FIVE SOUS GLASSES OF ICED LEMONADE FLAVORED WITH ORANGE-FLOWERS. THEIR CRY “COOL COOL” CAN BE HEARD ACROSS THE EMPTY SQUARE. AFTER THEIR CRY SILENCE AGAIN FALLS UNDER THE BURNING SUN: IN THE VENDOR’S JUG THE ICE MOVES AND I CAN HEAR ITS TINKLE. THERE IS THE SILENCE OF THE SIESTA. IN THE STREETS OF THE MARINE IN FRONT OF THE DIRTY BARBERSHOPS IT CAN BE MEASURED IN THE MELODIOUS BUZZING OF FLIES BEHIND THE HOLLOW REED CURTAINS. ELSEWHERE IN THE MOORISH CAFES OF THE KASBAH THE BODY IS SILENT UNABLE TO TEAR ITSELF AWAY TO LEAVE THE GLASS OF TEA AND REDISCOVER TIME WITH THE PULSING OF ITS OWN BLOOD. BUT ABOVE ALL THERE IS THE SILENCE OF SUMMER EVENINGS.
    THOSE BRIEF MOMENTS WHEN DAY TOPPLES INTO NIGHT MUST BE PEOPLED WITH SECRET SIGNS AND SUMMONS FOR MY ALGIERS TO BE SO CLOSELY LINKED TO THEM. WHEN I SPEND SOME TIME FAR FROM THAT TOWN I IMAGINE ITS TWILIGHTS AS PROMISES OF HAPPINESS. ON THE HILLS ABOVE THE CITY THERE ARE PATHS AMONG THE MASTICS AND OLIVE TREES. AND TOWARD THEM MY HEART TURNS AT SUCH MOMENTS. I SEE FLIGHTS OF BLACK BIRDS RISE AGAINST THE GREEN HORIZON. IN THE SKY SUDDENLY DIVESTED OF ITS SUN SOMETHING RELAXES. A WHOLE LITTLE NATION OF RED CLOUDS STRETCHES OUT UNTIL IT IS ABSORBED IN THE AIR. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD APPEARS THE FIRST STAR THAT HAD BEEN SEEN TAKING SHAPE AND CONSISTENCY IN THE DEPTH OF THE SKY. AND THEN SUDDENLY ALL CONSUMING NIGHT. WHAT EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY DO THE FUGITIVE ALGERIAN EVENINGS POSSESS TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE SO MANY THINGS IN ME? I HAVEN’T TIME TO TIRE OF THAT SWEETNESS THEY LEAVE ON MY LIPS BEFORE IT HAS DISAPPEARED INTO NIGHT. IS THIS THE SECRET OF ITS PERSISTENCE? THIS COUNTRY’S AFFECTION IS OVERWHELMING AND FURTIVE. BUT DURING THE MOMENT IT IS PRESENT ONE’S HEART AT LEAST SURRENDERS COMPLETELY TO IT. AT PADOVANI BEACH THE DANCE HALL IS OPEN EVERY DAY. AND IN THAT HUGE RECTANGULAR BOX WITH ITS ENTIRE SIDE OPEN TO THE SEA THE POOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD DANCE UNTIL EVENING. OFTEN I USED TO AWAIT THERE A MOMENT OF EXCEPTIONAL BEAUTY. DURING THE DAY THE HALL IS PROTECTED BY SLOPING WOODEN AWNINGS. WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN THEY ARE RAISED. THEN THE HALL IS FILLED WITH AN ODD GREEN LIGHT BORN OF THE DOUBLE SHELL OF THE SKY AND THE SEA. WHEN ONE IS SEATED FAR FROM THE WINDOWS ONE SEES ONLY THE SKY AND SILHOUETTED AGAINST IT THE FACES OF THE DANCERS PASSING IN SUCCESSION. SOMETIMES A WALTZ IS BEING PLAYED AND AGAINST THE GREEN BACKGROUND THE BLACK PROFILES WHIRL OBSTINATELY LIKE THOSE CUT-OUT SILHOUETTES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO A PHONOGRAPH’S TURNTABLE. NIGHT COMES RAPIDLY AFTER THIS AND WITH IT THE LIGHTS. BUT I AM UNABLE TO RELATE THE THRILL AND SECRECY THAT SUBTLE INSTANT HOLDS FOR ME. I RECALL AT LEAST A MAGNIFICENT TALL GIRL WHO HAD DANCED ALL AFTERNOON. SHE WAS WEARING A JASMINE GARLAND ON HER TIGHT BLUE DRESS WET WITH PERSPIRATION FROM THE SMALL OF HER BACK TO HER LEGS. SHE WAS LAUGHING AS SHE DANCED AND THROWING BACK HER HEAD. AS SHE PASSED THE TABLES SHE LEFT BEHIND HER A MINGLED SCENT OF FLOWERS AND FLESH. WHEN EVENING CAME I COULD NO LONGER SEE HER BODY PRESSED TIGHT TO HER PARTNER BUT AGAINST THE SKY WHIRLED ALTERNATING SPOTS OF WHITE JASMINE AND BLACK HAIR AND WHEN SHE WOULD THROW BACK HER SWELLING BREAST I WOULD HEAR HER LAUGH AND SEE HER PARTNER’S PROFILE SUDDENLY PLUNGE FORWARD. I OWE TO SUCH EVENINGS THE IDEA I HAVE OF INNOCENCE. IN ANY CASE I LEARN NOT TO SEPARATE THESE CREATURES BURSTING WITH VIOLENT ENERGY FROM THE SKY WHERE THEIR DESIRES WHIRL.

    IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MOVIES IN ALGIERS PEPPERMINT LOZENGES ARE SOMETIMES SOLD WITH STAMPED IN RED ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO THE AWAKENING OF LOVE: (1) QUESTIONS: “WHEN WILL YOU MARRY ME?” “DO YOU LOVE ME?” AND (2) REPLIES: “MADLY” “NEXT SPRING.” AFTER HAVING PREPARED THE WAY YOU PASS THEM TO YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO ANSWERS LIKEWISE OR ELSE TURNS A DEAF EAR. AT BELCOURT MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN ARRANGED THIS WAY AND WHOLE LIVES BEEN PLEDGED BY THE MERE EXCHANGE OF PEPPERMINT LOZENGES. AND THIS REALLY DEPICTS THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE OF THIS REGION.
    THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF YOUTH IS PERHAPS A MAGNIFICENT VOCATION FOR FACILE JOYS. BUT ABOVE ALL IT IS A HASTE TO LIVE THAT BORDERS ON WASTE. AT BELCOURT AS AT BAB-EL-OUED PEOPLE GET MARRIED YOUNG. THEY GO TO WORK EARLY AND IN TEN YEARS EXHAUST THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME. A THIRTY-YEAR-OLD WORKMAN HAS ALREADY PLAYED ALL THE CARDS IN HIS HAND. HE AWAITS THE END BETWEEN HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN. HIS JOYS HAVE BEEN SUDDEN AND MERCILESS AS HAS BEEN HIS LIFE. ONE REALIZES THAT HE IS BORN OF THIS COUNTRY WHERE EVERYTHING IS GIVEN TO BE TAKEN AWAY. IN THAT PLENTY AND PROFUSION LIFE FOLLOWS THE SWEEP OF GREAT PASSIONS SUDDEN EXACTING AND GENEROUS. IT IS NOT TO BE BUILT UP BUT TO BE BURNED UP. STOPPING TO THINK AND BECOMING BETTER ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE NOTION OF HELL FOR INSTANCE IS MERELY A FUNNY JOKE HERE. SUCH IMAGININGS ARE ALLOWED ONLY TO THE VERY VIRTUOUS. AND I REALLY THINK THAT VIRTUE IS A MEANINGLESS WORD IN ALL ALGERIA. NOT THAT THESE MEN LACK PRINCIPLES. THEY HAVE THEIR CODE AND A VERY SPECIAL ONE. YOU ARE NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO YOUR MOTHER. YOU SEE THAT YOUR WIFE IS RESPECTED IN THE STREET. YOU SHOW CONSIDERATION FOR A PREGNANT WOMAN. YOU DON’T DOUBLE UP ON AN ADVERSARY BECAUSE “THAT LOOKS BAD.” WHOEVER DOES NOT OBSERVE THESE ELEMENTARY COMMANDMENTS “IS NOT A MAN” AND THE QUESTION IS DECIDED. THIS STRIKES ME AS FAIR AND STRONG. THERE ARE STILL MANY OF US WHO AUTOMATICALLY OBSERVE THIS CODE OF THE STREET THE ONLY DISINTERESTED ONE I KNOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE SHOPKEEPER’S ETHICS ARE UNKNOWN. I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN FACES AROUND ME FILLED WITH PITY AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN BETWEEN TWO POLICEMEN. AND BEFORE KNOWING WHETHER THE MAN HAD STOLEN KILLED HIS FATHER OR WAS MERELY A NONCONFORMIST THEY WOULD SAY: “THE POOR FELLOW” OR ELSE WITH A HINT OF ADMIRATION: “HE’S A PIRATE ALL RIGHT.”
    THERE ARE RACES BORN FOR PRIDE AND LIFE. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT NOURISH THE STRANGEST VOCATION FOR BOREDOM. IT IS ALSO AMONG THEM THAT THE ATTITUDE TOWARD DEATH IS THE MOST REPULSIVE. ASIDE FROM SENSUAL PLEASURE THE AMUSEMENTS OF THIS RACE ARE AMONG THE SILLIEST. A SOCIETY OF BOWLERS AND ASSOCIATION BANQUETS THE THREE- FRANC MOVIES AND PARISH FEASTS HAVE FOR YEARS PROVIDED THE RECREATION OF THOSE OVER THIRTY. ALGIERS SUNDAYS ARE AMONG THE MOST SINISTER. HOW THEN COULD THIS RACE DEVOID OF SPIRITUALITY CLOTHE IN MYTHS THE PROFOUND HORROR OF ITS LIFE? EVERYTHING RELATED TO DEATH IS EITHER RIDICULOUS OR HATEFUL HERE. THIS POPULACE WITHOUT RELIGION AND WITHOUT IDOLS DIES ALONE AFTER HAVING LIVED IN A CROWD. I KNOW NO MORE HIDEOUS SPOT THAN THE CEMETERY ON BOULEVARD BRU OPPOSITE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD. AN ACCUMULATION OF BAD TASTE AMONG THE BLACK FENCINGS ALLOWS A DREADFUL MELANCHOLY TO RISE FROM THIS SPOT WHERE DEATH SHOWS HER TRUE LIKENESS. “EVERYTHING FADES” SAY THE HEART-SHAPED EX-VOTOS “EXCEPT MEMORY.” AND ALL INSIST ON THAT PALTRY ETERNITY PROVIDED US CHEAPLY BY THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO LOVED US. THE SAME WORDS FIT ALL DESPAIRS. ADDRESSED TO THE DEAD MAN THEY SPEAK TO HIM IN THE SECOND PERSON (OUR MEMORY WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU); LUGUBRIOUS PRETENSE WHICH ATTRIBUTES A BODY AND DESIRES TO WHAT IS AT BEST A BLACK LIQUID. ELSEWHERE AMID A DEADLY PROFUSION OF MARBLE FLOWERS AND BIRDS THIS BOLD ASSERTION: “NEVER WILL YOUR GRAVE BE WITHOUT FLOWERS.” BUT NEVER FEAR: THE INSCRIPTION SURROUNDS A GILDED STUCCO BOUQUET VERY TIME-SAVING FOR THE LIVING (LIKE THOSE IMMORTELLES WHICH OWE THEIR POMPOUS NAME TO THE GRATITUDE OF THOSE WHO STILL JUMP ONTO MOVING BUSES). INASMUCH AS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES THE CLASSIC WARBLER IS SOMETIMES REPLACED BY AN ASTOUNDING PEARL AIRPLANE PILOTED BY A SILLY ANGEL WHO WITHOUT REGARD FOR LOGIC IS PROVIDED WITH AN IMPRESSIVE PAIR OF WINGS.
    YET HOW TO BRING OUT THAT THESE IMAGES OF DEATH ARE NEVER SEPARATED FROM LIFE? HERE THE VALUES ARE CLOSELY LINKED. THE FAVORITE JOKE OF ALGERIAN UNDERTAKERS WHEN DRIVING AN EMPTY HEARSE IS TO SHOUT: “WANT A RIDE SISTER?” TO ANY PRETTY GIRLS THEY MEET ON THE WAY. THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO SEEING A SYMBOL IN THIS EVEN IF SOMEWHAT UNTOWARD. IT MAY SEEM BLASPHEMOUS LIKEWISE TO REPLY TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DEATH WHILE WINKING ONE’S LEFT EYE: “POOR FELLOW HE’LL NEVER SING AGAIN” OR LIKE THAT WOMAN OF ORAN WHO BAD NEVER LOVED HER HUSBAND: “GOD GAVE HIM TO ME AND GOD HAS TAKEN HIM FROM ME.” BUT ALL IN ALL I SEE NOTHING SACRED IN DEATH AND AM WELL AWARE ON THE OTHER HAND OF THE DISTANCE THERE IS BETWEEN FEAR AND RESPECT. EVERYTHING HERE SUGGESTS THE HORROR OF DYING IN A COUNTRY THAT INVITES ONE TO LIVE. AND YET IT IS UNDER THE VERY WALLS OF THIS CEMETERY THAT THE YOUNG OF BELCOURT HAVE THEIR ASSIGNATIONS AND THAT THE GIRLS OFFER THEMSELVES TO KISSES AND CARESSES.
    I AM WELL AWARE THAT SUCH A RACE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY ALL. HERE INTELLIGENCE HAS NO PLACE AS IN ITALY. THIS RACE IS INDIFFERENT TO THE MIND. IT HAS A CULT FOR AND ADMIRATION OF THE BODY. WHENCE ITS STRENGTH ITS INNOCENT CYNICISM AND A PUERILE VANITY WHICH EXPLAINS WHY IT IS SO SEVERELY JUDGED. IT IS COMMONLY BLAMED FOR ITS “MENTALITY”—THAT IS A WAY OF SEEING AND OF LIVING. AND IT IS TRUE THAT A CERTAIN INTENSITY OF LIFE IS INSEPARABLE FROM INJUSTICE. YET HERE IS A RATE WITHOUT PAST WITHOUT TRADITION AND YET NOT WITHOUT POETRY—BUT A POETRY WHOSE QUALITY I KNOW WELL HARSH CARNAL FAR FROM TENDERNESS THAT OF THEIR VERY SKY THE ONLY ONE IN TRUTH TO MOVE ME AND BRING ME INNER PEACE. THE CONTRARY OF A CIVILIZED NATION IS A CREATIVE NATION. I HAVE THE MAD HOPE THAT WITHOUT KNOWING IT PERHAPS THESE BARBARIANS LOUNGING ON BEACHES ARE ACTUALLY MODELING THE IMAGE OF A CULTURE IN WHICH THE GREATNESS OF MAN WILL AT LAST FIND ITS TRUE LIKENESS. THIS RACE WHOLLY CAST INTO ITS PRESENT LIVES WITHOUT MYTHS WITHOUT SOLACE. IT HAS PUT ALL ITS POSSESSIONS ON THIS EARTH AND THEREFORE REMAINS WITHOUT DEFENSE AGAINST DEATH. ALL THE GIFTS OF PHYSICAL BEAUTY HAVE BEEN LAVISHED ON IT. AND WITH THEM THE STRANGE AVIDITY THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES THAT WEALTH WITHOUT FUTURE. EVERYTHING THAT IS DONE HERE SHOWS A HORROR OF STABILITY AND A DISREGARD FOR THE FUTURE. PEOPLE ARE IN HASTE TO LIVE AND IF AN ART WERE TO BE BORN HERE IT WOULD OBEY THAT HATRED OF PERMANENCE THAT MADE THE DORIANS FASHION THEIR FIRST COLUMN IN WOOD. AND YET YES ONE CAN FIND MEASURE AS WELL AS EXCESS IN THE VIOLENT AND KEEN FACE OF THIS RACE IN THIS SUMMER SKY WITH NOTHING TENDER IN IT BEFORE WHICH ALL TRUTHS CAN BE UTTERED AND ON WHICH NO DECEPTIVE DIVINITY HAS TRACED THE SIGNS OF HOPE OR OF REDEMPTION. BETWEEN THIS SKY AND THESE FACES TURNED TOWARD IT NOTHING ON WHICH TO HANG A MYTHOLOGY A LITERATURE AN ETHIC OR A RELIGION BUT STONES FLESH STARS AND THOSE TRUTHS THE HAND CAN TOUCH.

* * *
    TO FEEL ONE’S ATTACHMENT TO A CERTAIN REGION ONE’S LOVE FOR A CERTAIN GROUP OF MEN TO KNOW THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A SPOT WHERE ONE’S HEART WILL FEEL AT PEACE THESE ARE MANY CERTAINTIES FOR A SINGLE HUMAN LIFE. AND YET THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT AT CERTAIN MOMENTS EVERYTHING YEARNS FOR THAT SPIRITUAL HOME. “YES WE MUST GO BACK THERE—THERE INDEED.” IS THERE ANYTHING ODD IN FINDING ON EARTH THAT UNION THAT PLOTINUS LONGED FOR? UNITY IS EXPRESSED HERE IN TERMS OF SUN AND SEA. THE HEART IS SENSITIVE TO IT THROUGH A CERTAIN SAVOR OF FLESH WHICH CONSTITUTES ITS BITTERNESS AND ITS GRANDEUR. I LEARN THAT THERE IS NO SUPERHUMAN HAPPINESS NO ETERNITY OUTSIDE THE SWEEP OF DAYS. THESE PALTRY AND ESSENTIAL BELONGINGS THESE RELATIVE TRUTHS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO STIR ME. AS FOR THE OTHERS THE “IDEAL” TRUTHS I HAVE NOT ENOUGH SOUL TO UNDERSTAND THEM. NOT THAT ONE MUST BE AN ANIMAL BUT I FIND NO MEANING IN THE HAPPINESS OF ANGELS. I KNOW SIMPLY THAT THIS SKY WILL LAST LONGER THAN I. AND WHAT SHALL I CALL ETERNITY EXCEPT WHAT WILL CONTINUE AFTER MY DEATH? I AM NOT EXPRESSING HERE THE CREATURE’S SATISFACTION WITH HIS CONDITION. IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT MATTER. IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO BE A MAN STILL LESS TO BE A PURE MAN. BUT BEING PURE IS RECOVERING THAT SPIRITUAL HOME WHERE ONE CAN FEEL THE WORLD’S RELATIONSHIP WHERE ONE’S PULSE- BEATS COINCIDE WITH THE VIOLENT THROBBING OF THE TWO-O’CLOCK SUN. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ONE’S NATIVE LAND IS ALWAYS RECOGNIZED AT THE MOMENT OF LOSING IT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE TOO UNEASY ABOUT THEMSELVES THEIR NATIVE LAND IS THE ONE THAT NEGATES THEM. I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO BE BRUTAL OR SEEM EXTRAVAGANT. BUT AFTER ALL WHAT NEGATES ME IN THIS LIFE IS FIRST OF ALL WHAT KILLS ME. EVERYTHING THAT EXALTS LIFE AT THE SAME TIME INCREASES ITS ABSURDITY. IN THE ALGERIAN SUMMER I LEARN THAT ONE THING ONLY IS MORE TRAGIC THAN SUFFERING AND THAT IS THE LIFE OF A HAPPY MAN. BUT IT MAY BE ALSO THE WAY TO A GREATER LIFE BECAUSE IT LEADS TO NOT CHEATING.
    MANY IN FACT FEIGN LOVE OF LIFE TO EVADE LOVE ITSELF. THEY TRY THEIR SKILL AT ENJOYMENT AND AT “INDULGING IN EXPERIENCES.” BUT THIS IS ILLUSORY. IT REQUIRES A RARE VOCATION TO BE A SENSUALIST. THE LIFE OF A MAN IS FULFILLED WITHOUT THE AID OF HIS MIND WITH ITS BACKWARD AND FORWARD MOVEMENTS AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME ITS SOLITUDE AND ITS PRESENCES. TO SEE THESE MEN OF BELCOURT WORKING PROTECTING THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND OFTEN WITHOUT A REPROACH I THINK ONE CAN FEEL A SECRET SHAME. TO BE SURE I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT IT. THERE IS NOT MUCH LOVE IN THE LIVES I AM SPEAKING OF. I OUGHT TO SAY THAT NOT MUCH REMAINS. BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE EVADED NOTHING. THERE ARE WORDS I HAVE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD SUCH AS “SIN.” YET I BELIEVE THESE MEN HAVE NEVER SINNED AGAINST LIFE. FOR IF THERE IS A SIN AGAINST LIFE IT CONSISTS PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH IN DESPAIRING OF LIFE AS IN HOPING FOR ANOTHER LIFE AND IN ELUDING THE IMPLACABLE GRANDEUR OF THIS LIFE. THESE MEN HAVE NOT CHEATED. GODS OF SUMMER THEY WERE AT TWENTY BY THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR LIFE AND THEY STILL ARE DEPRIVED OF ALL HOPE. I HAVE SEEN TWO OF THEM DIE. THEY WERE FULL OF HORROR BUT SILENT. IT IS BETTER THUS. FROM PANDORA’S BOX WHERE ALL THE ILLS OF HUMANITY SWARMED THE GREEKS DREW OUT HOPE AFTER ALL THE OTHERS AS THE MOST DREADFUL OF ALL. I KNOW NO MORE STIRRING SYMBOL; FOR CONTRARY TO THE GENERAL BELIEF HOPE EQUALS RESIGNATION. AND TO LIVE IS NOT TO RESIGN ONESELF. THIS AT LEAST IS THE BITTER LESSON OF ALGERIAN SUMMERS. BUT ALREADY THE SEASON IS WAVERING AND SUMMER TOTTERS. THE FIRST SEPTEMBER RAINS AFTER SUCH VIOLENCE AND HARDENING ARE LIKE THE LIBERATED EARTH’S FIRST TEARS AS IF FOR A FEW DAYS THIS COUNTRY TRIED ITS HAND AT TENDERNESS. YET AT THE SAME PERIOD THE CAROB TREES COVER ALL OF ALGERIA WITH A SCENT OF LOVE. IN THE EVENING OR AFTER THE RAIN THE WHOLE EARTH ITS WOMB MOIST WITH A SEED REDOLENT OF BITTER ALMOND RESTS AFTER HAVING GIVEN HERSELF TO THE SUN ALL SUMMER LONG. AND AGAIN THAT SCENT HALLOWS THE UNION OF MAN AND EARTH AND AWAKENS IN US THE ONLY REALLY VIRILE LOVE IN THIS WORLD: EPHEMERAL AND NOBLE.

 I. AS AN ARTIST HAVE YOU CHOSEN THE ROLE OF WITNESS?
    THIS WOULD TAKE CONSIDERABLE PRESUMPTION OR A VOCATION I LACK. PERSONALLY I DON’T ASK FOR ANY ROLE AND I HAVE BUT ONE REAL VOCATION. AS A MAN I HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR HAPPINESS; AS AN ARTIST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I STILL HAVE CHARACTERS TO BRING TO LIFE WITHOUT THE HELP OF WARS OR OF LAW-COURTS. BUT I HAVE BEEN SOUGHT OUT AS EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN SOUGHT OUT. ARTISTS OF THE PAST COULD AT LEAST KEEP SILENT IN THE FACE OF TYRANNY. THE TYRANNIES OF TODAY ARE IMPROVED; THEY NO LONGER ADMIT OF SILENCE OR NEUTRALITY. ONE HAS TO TAKE A STAND BE EITHER FOR OR AGAINST. WELL IN THAT CASE I AM AGAINST. BUT THIS DOES NOT AMOUNT TO CHOOSING THE COMFORTABLE ROLE OF WITNESS. IT IS MERELY ACCEPTING THE TIME AS IT IS MINDING ONE’S OWN BUSINESS IN SHORT. MOREOVER YOU ARE FORGETTING THAT TODAY JUDGES ACCUSED AND WITNESSES EXCHANGE POSITIONS WITH EXEMPLARY RAPIDITY. MY CHOICE IF YOU THINK I AM MAKING ONE WOULD AT LEAST BE NEVER TO SIT ON A JUDGE’S BENCH OR BENEATH IT LIKE SO MANY OF OUR PHILOSOPHERS. ASIDE FROM THAT THERE IS NO DEARTH OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION IN THE RELATIVE. TRADE-UNIONISM IS TODAY THE FIRST AND THE MOST FRUITFUL AMONG THEM.

    II. IS NOT THE QUIXOTISM THAT HAS BEEN CRITICIZED IN YOUR RECENT WORKS AN IDEALISTIC AND ROMANTIC DEFINITION OF THE ARTIST’S ROLE?
    HOWEVER WORDS ARE PERVERTED THEY PROVISIONALLY KEEP THEIR MEANING. AND IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE ROMANTIC IS THE ONE WHO CHOOSES THE PERPETUAL MOTION OF HISTORY THE GRANDIOSE EPIC AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A MIRACULOUS EVENT AT THE END OF TIME. IF I HAVE TRIED TO DEFINE SOMETHING IT IS ON THE CONTRARY SIMPLY THE COMMON EXISTENCE OF HISTORY AND OF MAN EVERYDAY LIFE WITH THE MOST POSSIBLE LIGHT THROWN UPON IT THE DOGGED STRUGGLE AGAINST ONE’S OWN DEGRADATION AND THAT OF OTHERS.
    IT IS LIKEWISE IDEALISM AND OF THE WORSE KIND TO END UP BY HANGING ALL ACTION AND ALL TRUTH ON A MEANING OF HISTORY THAT IS NOT IMPLICIT IN EVENTS AND THAT IN ANY CASE IMPLIES A MYTHICAL AIM. WOULD IT THEREFORE BE REALISM TO TAKE AS THE LAWS OF HISTORY THE FUTURE—IN OTHER WORDS JUST WHAT IS NOT YET HISTORY SOMETHING OF WHOSE NATURE WE KNOW NOTHING?
    IT SEEMS TO ME ON THE CONTRARY THAT I AM ARGUING IN FAVOR OF A TRUE REALISM AGAINST A MYTHOLOGY THAT IS BOTH ILLOGICAL AND DEADLY AND AGAINST ROMANTIC NIHILISM WHETHER IT BE BOURGEOIS OR ALLEGEDLY REVOLUTIONARY. TO TELL THE TRUTH FAR FROM BEING ROMANTIC I BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY OF A RULE AND AN ORDER. I MERELY SAY THAT THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF JUST ANY RULE WHATSOEVER. AND THAT IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF THE RULE WE NEED WERE GIVEN US BY THIS DISORDERED SOCIETY OR ON THE OTHER HAND BY THOSE DOCTRINAIRES WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES LIBERATED FROM ALL RULES AND ALL SCRUPLES.

    III. THE MARXISTS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS LIKEWISE THINK THEY ARE HUMANISTS. BUT FOR THEM HUMAN NATURE WILL BE FORMED IN THE CLASSLESS SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE.
    TO BEGIN WITH THIS PROVES THAT THEY REJECT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WHAT WE ALL ARE: THOSE HUMANISTS ARE ACCUSERS OF MAN. HOW CAN WE BE SURPRISED THAT SUCH A CLAIM SHOULD HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE WORLD OF COURT TRIALS? THEY REJECT THE MAN OF TODAY IN THE NAME OF THE MAN OF THE FUTURE. THAT CLAIM IS RELIGIOUS IN NATURE. WHY SHOULD IT BE MORE JUSTIFIED THAN THE ONE WHICH ANNOUNCES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO COME? IN REALITY THE END OF HISTORY CANNOT HAVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CONDITION ANY DEFINABLE SIGNIFICANCE. IT CAN ONLY BE THE OBJECT OF A FAITH AND OF A NEW MYSTIFICATION. A MYSTIFICATION THAT TODAY IS NO LESS GREAT THAN THE ONE THAT OF OLD BASED COLONIAL OPPRESSION ON THE NECESSITY OF SAVING THE SOULS OF INFIDELS.

    IV. IS NOT THAT WHAT IN REALITY SEPARATES YOU FROM THE INTELLECTUALS OF THE LEFT?
    YOU MEAN THAT IS WHAT SEPARATES THOSE INTELLECTUALS FROM THE LEFT? TRADITIONALLY THE LEFT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR AGAINST INJUSTICE OBSCURANTISM AND OPPRESSION. IT ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THOSE PHENOMENA WERE INTERDEPENDENT. THE IDEA THAT OBSCURANTISM CAN LEAD TO JUSTICE THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO LIBERTY IS QUITE RECENT. THE TRUTH IS THAT CERTAIN INTELLECTUALS OF THE LEFT (NOT ALL FORTUNATELY) ARE TODAY HYPNOTIZED BY FORCE AND EFFICACY AS OUR INTELLECTUALS OF THE RIGHT WERE BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR. THEIR ATTITUDES ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE ACT OF RESIGNATION IS THE SAME. THE FIRST WANTED TO BE REALISTIC NATIONALISTS; THE SECOND WANT TO BE REALISTIC SOCIALISTS. IN THE END THEY BETRAY NATIONALISM AND SOCIALISM ALIKE IN THE NAME OF A REALISM HENCEFORTH WITHOUT CONTENT AND ADORED AS A PURE AND ILLUSORY TECHNIQUE OF EFFICACY.
    THIS IS A TEMPTATION THAT CAN AFTER ALL BE UNDERSTOOD. BUT STILL HOWEVER THE QUESTION IS LOOKED AT THE NEW POSITION OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES OR THINK THEMSELVES LEFTISTS CONSISTS IN SAYING: CERTAIN OPPRESSIONS ARE JUSTIFIABLE BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE DIRECTION WHICH CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED OF HISTORY. HENCE THERE ARE PRESUMABLY PRIVILEGED EXECUTIONERS AND PRIVILEGED BY NOTHING. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WAS SAID IN ANOTHER CONTEXT BY JOSEPH DE MAISTRE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TAKEN FOR AN INCENDIARY. BUT THIS IS A THESIS WHICH PERSONALLY I SHALL ALWAYS REJECT. ALLOW ME TO SET UP AGAINST IT THE TRADITIONAL POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT HAS BEEN HITHERTO CALLED THE LEFT: ALL EXECUTIONERS ARE OF THE SAME FAMILY.

    V. WHAT CAN THE ARTIST DO IN THE WORLD OF TODAY?
    HE IS NOT ASKED EITHER TO WRITE ABOUT CO-OPERATIVES OR CONVERSELY TO LULL TO SLEEP IN HIMSELF THE SUFFERINGS ENDURED BY OTHERS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. AND SINCE YOU HAVE ASKED ME TO SPEAK PERSONALLY I AM GOING TO DO SO AS SIMPLY AS I CAN. CONSIDERED AS ARTISTS WE PERHAPS HAVE NO NEED TO INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD. BUT CONSIDERED AS MEN YES. THE MINER WHO IS EXPLOITED OR SHOT DOWN THE SLAVES IN THE CAMPS THOSE IN THE COLONIES THE LEGIONS OF PERSECUTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD—THEY NEED ALL THOSE WHO CAN SPEAK TO COMMUNICATE THEIR SILENCE AND TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM. I HAVE NOT WRITTEN DAY AFTER DAY FIGHTING ARTICLES AND TEXTS I HAVE NOT TAKEN PART IN THE COMMON STRUGGLES BECAUSE I DESIRE THE WORLD TO BE COVERED WITH GREEK STATUES AND MASTERPIECES. THE MAN WHO HAS SUCH A DESIRE DOES EXIST IN ME. EXCEPT THAT HE HAS SOMETHING BETTER TO DO IN TRYING TO INSTILL LIFE INTO THE CREATURES OF HIS IMAGINATION. BUT FROM MY FIRST ARTICLES TO MY LATEST BOOK I HAVE WRITTEN SO MUCH AND PERHAPS TOO MUCH ONLY BECAUSE I CANNOT KEEP FROM BEING DRAWN TOWARD EVERYDAY LIFE TOWARD THOSE WHOEVER THEY MAY BE WHO ARE HUMILIATED AND DEBASED. THEY NEED TO HOPE AND IF ALL KEEP SILENT OR IF THEY ARE GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO KINDS OF HUMILIATION THEY WILL BE FOREVER DEPRIVED OF HOPE AND WE WITH THEM. IT SEEMS TO ME IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE THAT IDEA NOR CAN HE WHO CANNOT ENDURE IT LIE DOWN TO SLEEP IN HIS TOWER. NOT THROUGH VIRTUE AS YOU SEE BUT THROUGH A SORT OF ALMOST ORGANIC INTOLERANCE WHICH YOU FEEL OR DO NOT FEEL. INDEED I SEE MANY WHO FAIL TO FEEL IT BUT I CANNOT ENVY THEIR SLEEP. THIS DOES NOT MEAN HOWEVER THAT WE MUST SACRIFICE OUR ARTIST’S NATURE TO SOME SOCIAL PREACHING OR OTHER. I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE WHY THE ARTIST WAS MORE THAN EVER NECESSARY. BUT IF WE INTERVENE AS MEN THAT EXPERIENCE WILL HAVE AN EFFECT UPON OUR LANGUAGE. AND IF WE ARE NOT ARTISTS IN OUR LANGUAGE FIRST OF ALL WHAT SORT OF ARTISTS ARE WE? EVEN IF MILITANTS IN OUR LIVES WE SPEAK IN OUR WORKS OF DESERTS AND OF SELFISH LOVE THE MERE FACT THAT OUR LIVES ARE MILITANT CAUSES A SPECIAL TONE OF VOICE TO PEOPLE WITH MEN THAT DESERT AND THAT LOVE. I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT CHOOSE THE MOMENT WHEN WE ARE BEGINNING TO LEAVE NIHILISM BEHIND TO STUPIDLY DENY THE VALUES OF CREATION IN FAVOR OF THE VALUES OF HUMANITY OR VICE VERSA. IN MY MIND NEITHER ONE IS EVER SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER AND I MEASURE THE GREATNESS OF AN ARTIST (MOLIERE TOLSTOY MELVILLE) BY THE BALANCE HE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN BETWEEN THE TWO. TODAY UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EVENTS WE ARE OBLIGED TO TRANSPORT THAT TENSION INTO OUR LIVES LIKEWISE. THIS IS WHY SO MANY ARTISTS BENDING UNDER THE BURDEN TAKE REFUGE IN THE IVORY TOWER OR CONVERSELY IN THE SOCIAL CHURCH. BUT AS FOR ME I SEE IN BOTH CHOICES A LIKE ACT OF RESIGNATION. WE MUST SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVE SUFFERING AND BEAUTY. THE LONG PATIENCE “THE STRENGTH THE SECRET CUNNING SUCH SERVICE CALLS FOR ARE THE VIRTUES THAT ESTABLISH THE VERY RENASCENCE WE NEED.
    ONE WORD MORE. THIS UNDERTAKING I KNOW CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT DANGERS AND BITTERNESS. WE MUST ACCEPT THE DANGERS: THE ERA OF CHAIRBOUND ARTISTS IS OVER. BUT WE MUST REJECT THE BITTERNESS. ONE OF THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE ARTIST IS TO BELIEVE HIMSELF SOLITARY AND IN TRUTH HE BEARS THIS SHOUTED AT HIM WITH A CERTAIN BASE DELIGHT. BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. HE STANDS IN THE MIDST OF ALL IN THE SAME RANK NEITHER HIGHER NOR LOWER WITH ALL THOSE WHO ARE WORKING AND STRUGGLING. HIS VERY VOCATION IN THE FACE OF OPPRESSION IS TO OPEN THE PRISONS AND TO GIVE A VOICE TO THE SORROWS AND JOYS OF ALL. THIS IS WHERE ART AGAINST ITS ENEMIES JUSTIFIES ITSELF BY PROVING PRECISELY THAT IT IS NO ONE’S ENEMY. BY ITSELF ART COULD PROBABLY NOT PRODUCE THE RENASCENCE WHICH IMPLIES JUSTICE AND LIBERTY. BUT WITHOUT IT THAT RENASCENCE WOULD BE WITHOUT FORMS AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD BE NOTHING. WITHOUT CULTURE AND THE RELATIVE FREEDOM IT IMPLIES SOCIETY EVEN WHEN PERFECT IS BUT A JUNGLE. THIS IS WHY ANY AUTHENTIC CREATION IS A GIFT TO THE FUTURE.

I FELT THE GODS WERE LACKING AS LONG AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO OPPOSE THEM.

—LUCIAN PROMETHEUS IN THE CAUCASUS

WHAT DOES PROMETHEUS MEAN TO MAN TODAY? ONE COULD DOUBTLESS CLAIM THIS GOD-DEFYING REBEL AS THE MODEL OF CONTEMPORARY MAN AND HIS PROTEST THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO IN THE DESERTS OF SCYTHIA AS CULMINATING IN THE UNPARALLELED HISTORICAL CONVULSION OF OUR DAY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING SUGGESTS THAT THIS VICTIM OF PERSECUTION IS STILL AMONG US AND THAT WE ARE STILL DEAF TO THE GREAT CRY OF HUMAN REVOLT OF WHICH HE GIVES THE SOLITARY SIGNAL.

MODERN MAN INDEED ENDURES A MULTITUDE OF SUFFERING ON THE NARROW SURFACE OF THIS EARTH; FOR THE MAN DEPRIVED OF FOOD AND WARMTH LIBERTY IS MERELY A LUXURY THAT CAN WAIT; ALL HE CAN DO IS SUFFER A LITTLE MORE AS IF IT WERE ONLY A QUESTION OF LETTING LIBERTY AND ITS LAST WITNESSES VANISH A BIT MORE. PROMETHEUS WAS THE HERO WHO LOVED MEN ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM FIRE AND LIBERTY TECHNOLOGY AND ART. TODAY MANKIND NEEDS AND CARES ONLY FOR TECHNOLOGY. WE REBEL THROUGH OUR MACHINES HOLDING ART AND WHAT ART IMPLIES AS AN OBSTACLE AND A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. BUT WHAT CHARACTERIZES PROMETHEUS IS THAT HE CANNOT SEPARATE MACHINES FROM ART. HE BELIEVES THAT BOTH SOULS AND BODIES CAN BE FREED AT THE SAME TIME. MAN TODAY BELIEVES THAT WE MUST FIRST OF ALL FREE THE BODY EVEN IF THE MIND MUST SUFFER TEMPORARY DEATH. BUT CAN THE MIND DIE TEMPORARILY? INDEED IF PROMETHEUS WERE TO REAPPEAR MODERN MAN WOULD TREAT HIM AS THE GODS DID LONG AGO: THEY WOULD NAIL HIM TO A ROCK IN THE NAME OF THE VERY HUMANISM HE WAS THE FIRST TO SYMBOLIZE. THE HOSTILE VOICES TO INSULT THE DEFEATED VICTIM WOULD BE THE VERY ONES THAT ECHO ON THE THRESHOLD OF AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY: THOSE OF FORCE AND VIOLENCE.

AM I YIELDING TO THE MEANNESS OF OUR TIMES TO NAKED TREES AND THE WINTER OF THE WORLD? BUT THIS VERY NOSTALGIA FOR LIGHT IS MY JUSTIFICATION: IT SPEAKS TO ME OF ANOTHER WORLD OF MY TRUE HOMELAND. DOES THIS NOSTALGIA STILL MEAN SOMETHING TO SOME MEN? THE YEAR THE WAR BEGAN I WAS TO BOARD A SHIP AND FOLLOW THE VOYAGE OF ULYSSES. AT THAT TIME EVEN A YOUNG MAN WITHOUT MONEY COULD ENTERTAIN THE EXTRAVAGANT NOTION OF CROSSING THE SEA IN QUEST OF SUNLIGHT. BUT I DID WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DID AT THE TIME. I DID NOT GET ON THAT SHIP. I TOOK MY PLACE IN THE QUEUE SHUFFLING TOWARD THE OPEN MOUTH OF HELL. LITTLE BY LITTLE WE ENTERED. AT THE FIRST CRY OF MURDERED INNOCENCE THE DOOR SLAMMED SHUT BEHIND US. WE WERE IN HELL AND WE HAVE NOT LEFT IT SINCE. FOR SIX LONG YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH IT. NOW WE GLIMPSE THE WARM GHOSTS OF FORTUNATE ISLANDS ONLY AT THE END OF LONG COLD SUNLESS YEARS THAT LIE AHEAD.

HOW THEN IN THIS DAMP DARK EUROPE CAN WE AVOID HEARING WITH A QUIVER OF REGRET AND DIFFICULT COMPLICITY THE CRY THE AGED CHATEAUBRIAND UTTERED TO AMPÈRE DEPARTING FOR GREECE: “YOU WON’T FIND A LEAF FROM THE OLIVE TREES OR A SINGLE GRAPE LEFT OF THE ONES I SAW IN ATTICA. I EVEN MISS THE GRASS THAT GREW THERE IN MY DAY. I HAVEN’T HAD THE STRENGTH TO MAKE A PATCH OF HEATHER GROW.” AND WE TOO FOR ALL OUR YOUTHFUL BLOOD SUNK AS WE ARE IN THE TERRIBLE OLD AGE OF THIS LAST CENTURY SOMETIMES MISS THE GRASS THAT HAS ALWAYS GROWN THE OLIVE LEAF THAT WE’LL NO LONGER GO TO LOOK AT JUST TO SEE IT AND THE GRAPES OF LIBERTY. MAN IS EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE WE FIND HIS CRIES HIS SUFFERING AND HIS THREATS. WITH SO MANY MEN GATHERED TOGETHER THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GRASSHOPPERS. HISTORY IS A STERILE EARTH WHERE HEATHER DOES NOT GROW. YET MEN TODAY HAVE CHOSEN HISTORY AND THEY NEITHER COULD NOR SHOULD TURN AWAY FROM IT. BUT INSTEAD OF MASTERING IT THEY AGREE A LITTLE MORE EACH DAY TO BE ITS SLAVE. THUS THEY BETRAY PROMETHEUS THIS SON “BOTH BOLD IN THOUGHT AND LIGHT OF HEART.” THIS IS HOW THEY REVERT TO THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THE MEN PROMETHEUS TRIED TO SAVE. “THEY SAW WITHOUT SEEING HEARD WITHOUT LISTENING LIKE FIGURES IN A DREAM.”

YES ONE EVENING IN PROVENCE ONE PERFECT HILL ONE WHIFF OF SALT ARE ENOUGH TO SHOW US THAT EVERYTHING STILL LIES BEFORE US. WE NEED TO INVENT FIRE ONCE MORE TO SETTLE DOWN ONCE AGAIN TO THE JOB OF APPEASING THE BODY’S HUNGER. ATTICA LIBERTY AND ITS GRAPE-GATHERING THE BREAD OF THE SOUL MUST COME LATER. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS BUT CRY TO OURSELVES: “THEY WILL NEVER EXIST ANY MORE OR THEY WILL EXIST FOR OTHERS” AND DO WHAT MUST BE DONE SO THAT OTHERS AT LEAST DO NOT GO BEGGING? WE WHO FEEL THIS SO PAINFULLY AND YET WHO TRY TO ACCEPT IT WITHOUT BITTERNESS ARE WE LAGGING BEHIND OR ARE WE FORGING AHEAD AND WILL WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO MAKE THE HEATHER GROW AGAIN?

WE CAN IMAGINE HOW PROMETHEUS WOULD HAVE REPLIED TO THIS QUESTION THAT RISES FROM OUR CENTURY. INDEED HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIS ANSWER: “I PROMISE YOU O MORTALS BOTH IMPROVEMENT AND REPAIR IF YOU ARE SKILLFUL VIRTUOUS AND STRONG ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THEM WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.” IF THEN IT IS TRUE THAT SALVATION LIES IN OUR OWN HANDS I WILL ANSWER YES TO THE QUESTION OF THE CENTURY BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHTFUL STRENGTH AND THE INTELLIGENT COURAGE I STILL FEEL IN SOME OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW. “O JUSTICE O MY MOTHER” CRIES PROMETHEUS “YOU SEE WHAT I AM MADE TO SUFFER.” AND HERMES MOCKS THE HERO: “I AM AMAZED THAT BEING A GOD YOU DID NOT FORESEE THE TORMENT YOU ARE SUFFERING.” “I DID SEE IT” REPLIES THE REBEL. THE MEN I’VE MENTIONED ARE ALSO THE SONS OF JUSTICE. THEY TOO SUFFER FROM THE MISERY OF ALL MEN KNOWING WHAT THEY DO. THEY KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT BLIND JUSTICE DOES NOT EXIST THAT HISTORY HAS NO EYES AND THAT WE MUST THEREFORE REJECT ITS JUSTICE IN ORDER TO REPLACE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE JUSTICE CONCEIVED BY THE MIND. THIS IS HOW PROMETHEUS RETURNS IN OUR CENTURY.

MYTHS HAVE NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN. THEY WAIT FOR US TO GIVE THEM FLESH. IF ONE MAN IN THE WORLD ANSWERS THEIR CALL THEY GIVE US THEIR STRENGTH IN ALL ITS FULLNESS. WE MUST PRESERVE THIS MYTH AND ENSURE THAT ITS SLUMBER IS NOT MORTAL SO THAT ITS RESURRECTION IS POSSIBLE. I SOMETIMES DOUBT WHETHER MEN CAN BE SAVED TODAY. BUT IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO SAVE THEIR CHILDREN BOTH BODY AND MIND. IT IS POSSIBLE TO OFFER THEM AT THE SAME TIME THE CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS AND BEAUTY. IF WE MUST RESIGN OURSELVES TO LIVING WITHOUT BEAUTY AND THE FREEDOM THAT IS A PART OF BEAUTY THE MYTH OF PROMETHEUS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT WILL REMIND US THAT ANY MUTILATION OF MAN CAN ONLY BE TEMPORARY AND THAT ONE SERVES NOTHING IN MAN IF ONE DOES NOT SERVE THE WHOLE MAN. IF HE IS HUNGRY FOR BREAD AND HEATHER AND IF IT IS TRUE THAT BREAD IS THE MORE NECESSARY LET US LEARN HOW TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF HEATHER ALIVE. AT THE DARKEST HEART OF HISTORY PROMETHEAN MEN WITHOUT FLINCHING FROM THEIR DIFFICULT CALLING WILL KEEP WATCH OVER THE EARTH AND THE TIRELESS GRASS. IN THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING OF THE GODS THE CHAINED HERO KEEPS HIS QUIET FAITH IN MAN. THIS IS HOW HE IS HARDER THAN HIS ROCK AND MORE PATIENT THAN HIS VULTURE. HIS LONG STUBBORNNESS HAS MORE MEANING FOR US THAN HIS REVOLT AGAINST THE GODS. ALONG WITH HIS ADMIRABLE DETERMINATION TO SEPARATE AND EXCLUDE NOTHING WHICH ALWAYS HAS AND ALWAYS WILL RECONCILE HUMANITY’S SUFFERING WITH THE SPRINGTIMES OF THE WORLD.

WAVES OF SUNLIGHT POURING FROM THE TOPMOST SKY BOUNCE FIERCELY ON THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND US. EVERYTHING GROWS QUIET BENEATH ITS FORCE AND MOUNT LUBERON OVER THERE IS MERELY A VAST BLOCK OF SILENCE THAT I LISTEN TO UNCEASINGLY. I LISTEN CAREFULLY SOMEONE IS RUNNING TOWARD ME IN THE DISTANCE INVISIBLE FRIENDS CALL TO ME MY JOY GROWS JUST AS YEARS AGO. ONCE AGAIN A HAPPY ENIGMA HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

WHERE IS THE ABSURDITY OF THE WORLD? IS IT THIS RESPLENDENT GLOW OR THE MEMORY OF ITS ABSENCE? WITH SO MUCH SUN IN MY MEMORY HOW COULD I HAVE WAGERED ON NONSENSE? PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE AMAZED; SO AM I AT TIMES. I COULD TELL THEM AS I TELL MYSELF THAT IT WAS IN FACT THE SUN THAT HELPED ME AND THAT THE VERY THICKNESS OF ITS LIGHT COAGULATES THE UNIVERSE AND ITS FORMS INTO A DAZZLING DARKNESS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF SAYING THIS AND I SHOULD LIKE FACED WITH THE WHITE AND BLACK CLARITY THAT FOR ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SIGN OF TRUTH TO EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE TERMS WHAT I FEEL ABOUT THIS ABSURDITY WHICH I KNOW TOO WELL TO ALLOW ANYONE TO HOLD FORTH ON IT WITHOUT MAKING CERTAIN NUANCES. THE VERY FACT OF TALKING ABOUT IT AFTER ALL WILL LEAD US BACK TO THE SUN.

NO MAN CAN SAY WHAT HE IS. BUT SOMETIMES HE CAN SAY WHAT HE IS NOT. EVERYONE WANTS THE MAN WHO IS STILL SEARCHING TO HAVE ALREADY REACHED HIS CONCLUSIONS. A THOUSAND VOICES ARE ALREADY TELLING HIM WHAT HE HAS FOUND AND YET HE KNOWS THAT HE HASN’T FOUND ANYTHING. SHOULD HE SEARCH ON AND LET THEM TALK? OF COURSE. BUT FROM TIME TO TIME ONE MUST DEFEND HIMSELF. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR CAUTIOUSLY I GIVE IT A NAME I WITHDRAW WHAT I SAID I REPEAT MYSELF I GO BACKWARD AND FORWARD. YET PEOPLE INSIST I IDENTIFY MY TERM OR TERMS ONCE AND FOR ALL. THEN I OBJECT; WHEN THINGS HAVE A LABEL AREN’T THEY LOST ALREADY? HERE AT LEAST IS WHAT I CAN TRY TO SAY.

IF I AM TO BELIEVE ONE OF MY FRIENDS A MAN ALWAYS HAS TWO CHARACTERS: HIS OWN AND THE ONE HIS WIFE THINKS HE HAS. SUBSTITUTE SOCIETY FOR WIFE AND WE SHALL UNDERSTAND HOW A PARTICULAR EXPRESSION USED BY A WRITER TO DESCRIBE A WHOLE CONTEXT OF EMOTIONS CAN BE ISOLATED BY THE WAY PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT AND LAID BEFORE ITS AUTHOR EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. WORDS ARE LIKE ACTIONS: “ARE YOU THE FATHER OF THIS CHILD?” “YES.” “THEN HE IS YOUR SON.” “IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT NOT AT ALL!” THUS GERARD DE NERVAL ONE FILTHY NIGHT HANGED HIMSELF TWICE ONCE FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS UNHAPPY AND A SECOND TIME FOR HIS LEGEND WHICH NOW HELPS SOME PEOPLE TO LIVE. NO ONE CAN WRITE ABOUT REAL UNHAPPINESS OR ABOUT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS AND I SHALL NOT TRY TO DO SO HERE. BUT AS FAR AS LEGENDS ARE CONCERNED WE CAN DESCRIBE THEM AND FOR A MOMENT AT LEAST BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DISPELLED THEM.

A WRITER WRITES TO A GREAT EXTENT TO BE READ (LET’S ADMIRE THOSE WHO SAY THEY DON’T BUT NOT BELIEVE THEM). YET MORE AND MORE IN FRANCE HE WRITES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THAT FINAL CONSECRATION WHICH CONSISTS OF NOT BEING READ. IN FACT FROM THE MOMENT HE CAN PROVIDE THE MATERIAL FOR A FEATURE ARTICLE IN THE POPULAR PRESS THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILL BE KNOWN TO A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER READ HIS WORKS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONTENT TO KNOW HIS NAME AND TO READ WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT HIM. FROM THAT POINT ON HE WILL BE KNOWN (AND FORGOTTEN) NOT FOR WHAT HE IS BUT ACCORDING TO THE IMAGE A HURRIED JOURNALIST HAS GIVEN OF HIM. TO MAKE A NAME IN LITERATURE THEREFORE IT IS NO LONGER INDISPENSABLE TO WRITE BOOKS. IT IS ENOUGH TO BE THOUGHT OF AS HAVING WRITTEN ONE WHICH THE EVENING PAPERS WILL HAVE MENTIONED AND WHICH ONE CAN FALL BACK ON FOR THE REST OF ONE’S LIFE.

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SUCH A REPUTATION GREAT OR SMALL WILL BE UNDESERVED. BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT? LET US RATHER ADMIT THAT THE INCONVENIENCE MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL. DOCTORS KNOW THAT CERTAIN ILLNESSES ARE DESIRABLE: THEY COMPENSATE IN SOME WAY FOR A FUNCTIONAL DISORDER WHICH WITHOUT THEM MIGHT EXPRESS ITSELF IN SOME MORE SERIOUS DISTURBANCE. THUS THERE ARE FORTUNATE CONSTIPATIONS AND PROVIDENTIAL ATTACKS OF ARTHRITIS. THE FLOOD OF WORDS AND HASTY JUDGMENTS WHICH NOWADAYS DROWNS ALL PUBLIC ACTIVITY IN AN OCEAN OF FRIVOLITY AT LEAST ENDOWS THE FRENCH WRITER WITH A MODESTY HE CONSTANTLY NEEDS IN A NATION THAT FURTHERMORE GIVES A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPORTANCE TO HIS CALLING. TO SEE ONE’S NAME IN TWO OR THREE NEWSPAPERS I COULD MENTION IS SO HARSH A TRIAL THAT IT MUST INEVITABLY INVOLVE SOME SPIRITUAL BENEFIT. PRAISE BE THEN TO A SOCIETY THAT TEACHES US SO CHEAPLY EVERY DAY BY ITS VERY HOMAGE THAT THE GREATNESS IT HONORS IS WORTHLESS. THE LOUDER ITS NOISE THE QUICKER IT DIES. IT EVOKES THE FLAXEN FIRES ALEXANDER VI OFTEN HAD BURNED BEFORE HIM TO REMIND HIM THAT THE GLORY OF THIS WORLD VANISHES LIKE SMOKE.

BUT LET’S LEAVE IRONY ASIDE. IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT AN ARTIST MUST RESIGN HIMSELF GOOD HUMOREDLY AND ALLOW WHAT HE KNOWS IS AN UNDESERVED IMAGE OF HIMSELF TO LIE ABOUT IN DENTISTS’ WAITING ROOMS AND AT THE HAIRDRESSER’S. I KNOW A FASHIONABLE WRITER WHO ACCORDING TO SUCH SOURCES SUPPOSEDLY SPENT EVERY NIGHT PRESIDING OVER BACCHANALIAN ORGIES WHERE NYMPHS WERE CLOTHED IN NOTHING BUT THEIR HAIR AND FAUNS HAD GLOOMY FINGERNAILS. ONE MIGHT HAVE WONDERED HOW HE FOUND THE TIME TO WRITE A SERIES OF BOOKS THAT FILL SEVERAL LIBRARY SHELVES. LIKE MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES THIS WRITER ACTUALLY SPENDS HIS NIGHTS SLEEPING IN ORDER TO SPEND LONG HOURS EVERY DAY AT HIS DESK AND DRINKS VICHY WATER SO AS NOT TO STRAIN HIS LIVER. THIS DOES NOT PREVENT THE AVERAGE FRENCHMAN WHOSE SAHARAN SOBRIETY AND MANIA FOR CLEANLINESS ARE WELL KNOWN FROM GROWING INDIGNANT AT THE IDEA OF OUR WRITERS TEACHING PEOPLE TO DRINK AND NOT TO WASH. THERE IS NO DEARTH OF EXAMPLES. I PERSONALLY CAN FURNISH AN EXCELLENT CHEAP RECIPE FOR SECURING A REPUTATION FOR AUSTERITY. I ACTUALLY HAVE SO WEIGHTY A REPUTATION A SOURCE OF GREAT AMUSEMENT TO MY FRIENDS (AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED IT RATHER MAKES ME BLUSH SINCE I KNOW HOW LITTLE I DESERVE IT). IT’S ENOUGH FOR INSTANCE TO DECLINE THE HONOR OF DINING WITH A NEWSPAPER EDITOR OF WHOM YOU DO NOT HAVE A HIGH OPINION. EVEN SIMPLE DECENCY CANNOT BE IMAGINED EXCEPT BY REFERENCE TO SOME TWISTED SICKNESS OF THE SOUL. NO ONE WILL EVER IMAGINE THAT IF YOU REFUSE THIS EDITOR’S DINNER IT MAY BE NOT ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAVEN’T A VERY HIGH OPINION OF HIM BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOUR GREATEST FEAR IN THE WORLD IS BEING BORED—AND WHAT IS MORE BORING THAN A TYPICAL PARISIAN DINNER?

ONE MUST THEREFORE SUBMIT. BUT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU CAN TRY TO READJUST THE SIGHTS AND REPEAT THAT YOU CAN’T ALWAYS BE A PAINTER OF THE ABSURD AND THAT NO ONE CAN BELIEVE IN A LITERATURE OF DESPAIR. OF COURSE IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO WRITE OR TO HAVE WRITTEN AN ESSAY ON THE NOTION OF THE ABSURD. BUT AFTER ALL YOU CAN ALSO WRITE ABOUT INCEST WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING HURLED YOURSELF ON YOUR UNFORTUNATE SISTER AND I HAVE NOWHERE READ THAT SOPHOCLES EVER THOUGHT OF KILLING HIS FATHER AND DISHONORING HIS MOTHER. THE IDEA THAT EVERY WRITER NECESSARILY WRITES ABOUT HIMSELF AND DEPICTS HIMSELF IN HIS BOOKS IS ONE OF THE PUERILE NOTIONS THAT WE HAVE INHERITED FROM ROMANTICISM. IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE—QUITE THE OPPOSITE—THAT A WRITER SHOULD BE INTERESTED FIRST AND FOREMOST IN OTHER PEOPLE OR IN HIS TIME OR IN WELL-KNOWN MYTHS. EVEN IF HE DOES HAPPEN TO PUT HIMSELF ON STAGE IT IS ONLY VERY EXCEPTIONALLY THAT HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE IS REALLY LIKE. A MAN’S WORKS OFTEN RETRACE THE STORY OF HIS NOSTALGIAS OR HIS TEMPTATIONS PRACTICALLY NEVER HIS OWN HISTORY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CLAIM TO BE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. NO MAN HAS EVER DARED DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS HE IS.

ON THE OTHER HAND AS FAR AS SUCH A THING IS POSSIBLE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN AN OBJECTIVE WRITER. WHAT I CALL AN OBJECTIVE AUTHOR IS ONE WHO CHOOSES THEMES WITHOUT EVER TAKING HIMSELF AS THE SUBJECT. BUT THE MODERN MANIA OF IDENTIFYING THE AUTHOR WITH HIS SUBJECT MATTER WILL NOT ALLOW HIM THIS RELATIVE CREATIVE LIBERTY. THUS DOES ONE BECOME A PROPHET OF THE ABSURD. YET WHAT ELSE HAVE I DONE EXCEPT REASON ABOUT AN IDEA I DISCOVERED IN THE STREETS OF MY TIME? THAT I HAVE NOURISHED THIS IDEA (AND PART OF ME NOURISHES IT STILL) ALONG WITH MY WHOLE GENERATION GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I SIMPLY SET IT FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO THAT I COULD DEAL WITH IT AND DECIDE ON ITS LOGIC. EVERYTHING THAT I’VE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE SINCE SHOWS THIS PLAINLY ENOUGH. BUT IT IS MORE CONVENIENT TO EXPLOIT A CLICHÉ THAN A NUANCE. THEY’VE CHOSEN THE CLICHÉ: SO I’M AS ABSURD AS EVER.

WHAT IS THE POINT OF SAYING YET AGAIN THAT IN THE EXPERIENCE WHICH INTERESTED ME AND WHICH I HAPPENED TO WRITE ABOUT THE ABSURD CAN BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE—EVEN THOUGH THE MEMORY AND FEELING OF IT STILL ACCOMPANY THE FARTHER ADVANCES. IN THE SAME MANNER WITH ALL DUE SENSE OF PROPORTION CARTESIAN DOUBT WHICH IS SYSTEMATIC WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE DESCARTES A SKEPTIC. IN ANY CASE HOW CAN ONE LIMIT ONESELF TO SAYING THAT NOTHING HAS MEANING AND THAT WE MUST PLUNGE INTO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR? WITHOUT GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS ONE CAN AT LEAST MENTION THAT JUST AS THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE MATERIALISM SINCE MERELY TO FORM THIS WORD IS ALREADY TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD APART FROM MATTER THERE IS LIKEWISE NO TOTAL NIHILISM. THE MOMENT YOU SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS NONSENSE YOU EXPRESS SOMETHING MEANINGFUL. REFUSING THE WORLD ALL MEANING AMOUNTS TO ABOLISHING ALL VALUE JUDGMENTS. BUT LIVING AND EATING FOR EXAMPLE ARE IN THEMSELVES VALUE JUDGMENTS. YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN ALIVE THE MOMENT YOU DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO DIE OF HUNGER AND CONSEQUENTLY YOU RECOGNIZE THAT LIFE HAS AT LEAST A RELATIVE VALUE. WHAT IN FACT DOES “LITERATURE OF DESPAIR” MEAN? DESPAIR IS SILENT. EVEN SILENCE MOREOVER IS MEANINGFUL IF YOUR EYES SPEAK. TRUE DESPAIR IS THE AGONY OF DEATH THE GRAVE OR THE ABYSS. IF HE SPEAKS IF HE REASONS ABOVE ALL IF HE WRITES IMMEDIATELY THE BROTHER REACHES OUT HIS HAND THE TREE IS JUSTIFIED LOVE IS BORN. LITERATURE OF DESPAIR IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.

OF COURSE A CERTAIN OPTIMISM IS NOT MY SPECIALITY. LIKE ALL MEN OF MY AGE I GREW UP TO THE SOUND OF THE DRUMS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND OUR HISTORY SINCE THAT TIME HAS REMAINED MURDER INJUSTICE OR VIOLENCE. BUT REAL PESSIMISM WHICH DOES EXIST LIES IN OUTBIDDING ALL THIS CRUELTY AND SHAME. FOR MY PART I HAVE NEVER CEASED FIGHTING AGAINST THIS DISHONOR AND I HATE ONLY THE CRUEL. I HAVE SOUGHT ONLY REASONS TO TRANSCEND OUR DARKEST NIHILISM. NOT I WOULD ADD THROUGH VIRTUE NOR BECAUSE OF SOME RARE ELEVATION OF THE SPIRIT BUT FROM AN INSTINCTIVE FIDELITY TO A LIGHT IN WHICH I WAS BORN AND IN WHICH FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN HAVE LEARNED TO WELCOME LIFE EVEN IN SUFFERING. AESCHYLUS IS OFTEN HEARTBREAKING; YET HE RADIATES LIGHT AND WARMTH. AT THE CENTER OF HIS UNIVERSE WE FIND NOT FLESHLESS NONSENSE BUT AN ENIGMA THAT IS TO SAY A MEANING WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER BECAUSE IT DAZZLES US. LIKEWISE TO THE UNWORTHY BUT NONETHELESS STUBBORN SONS OF GREECE WHO STILL SURVIVE IN THIS EMACIATED CENTURY THE SCORCHING HEAT OF OUR HISTORY MAY SEEM UNENDURABLE BUT THEY ENDURE IT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT. IN THE CENTER OF OUR WORK DARK THOUGH IT MAY BE SHINES AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUN THE SAME SUN THAT SHOUTS TODAY ACROSS THE HILLS AND PLAIN.

AFTER THIS THE FLAXEN FIRE CAN BURN; WHO CARES WHAT WE APPEAR TO BE AND WHAT WE USURP? WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE HAVE TO BE ARE ENOUGH TO FILL OUR LIVES AND OCCUPY OUR STRENGTH. PARIS IS A WONDROUS CAVE AND ITS INHABITANTS SEEING THEIR OWN SHADOWS REFLECTED ON THE FAR WALL TAKE THEM FOR THE ONLY REALITY THERE IS. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE STRANGE FLEETING RENOWN THIS TOWN DISPENSES. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED FAR FROM PARIS THAT THERE IS A LIGHT BEHIND US THAT WE MUST TURN AROUND AND CAST OFF OUR CHAINS IN ORDER TO FACE IT DIRECTLY AND THAT OUR TASK BEFORE WE DIE IS TO SEEK THROUGH ANY WORDS TO IDENTIFY IT. EVERY ARTIST IS UNDOUBTEDLY PURSUING HIS TRUTH. IF HE IS A GREAT ARTIST EACH WORK BRINGS HIM NEARER TO IT OR AT LEAST SWINGS STILL CLOSER TOWARD THIS CENTER THIS BURIED SUN WHERE EVERYTHING MUST ONE DAY BURN. IF HE IS MEDIOCRE EACH WORK TAKES HIM FURTHER FROM IT THE CENTER IS THEN EVERYWHERE THE LIGHT DISINTEGRATES. BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP THE ARTIST IN HIS OBSTINATE QUEST ARE THOSE WHO LOVE HIM AND THOSE WHO THEMSELVES LOVERS OR CREATORS FIND IN THEIR OWN PASSION THE MEASURE OF ALL PASSION AND HENCE KNOW HOW TO CRITICIZE.

YES ALL THIS NOISE…WHEN PEACE WOULD BE TO LOVE AND CREATE IN SILENCE! BUT WE MUST LEARN TO BE PATIENT. ONE MOMENT MORE THE SUN SEALS OUR MOUTHS.


YOU SAILED AWAY FROM YOUR FATHER’S DWELLING

WITH YOUR HEART ON FIRE MEDEA! AND YOU PASSED

BETWEEN THE ROCKY GATES OF THE SEAS;

AND NOW YOU SLEEP ON A FOREIGN SHORE.

—MEDEA

FOR FIVE DAYS THE RAIN HAD BEEN FAILING UNCEASINGLY ON ALGIERS FINALLY DRENCHING THE SEA ITSELF. FROM THE HEIGHTS OF AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE SKY UNENDING SHEETS OF RAIN SO THICK THEY WERE VISCOUS CRASHED INTO THE GULF. SOFT AND GRAY LIKE A GREAT SPONGE THE SEA HEAVED IN THE SHAPELESS BAY. BUT THE SURFACE OF THE WATER SEEMED ALMOST MOTIONLESS BENEATH THE STEADY RAIN. AT LONG INTERVALS HOWEVER A BROAD AND IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT RAISED A MURKY CLOUD OF STEAM FROM THE SEA AND ROLLED IT INTO THE HARBOR BELOW A CIRCLE OF SOAKING BOULEVARDS. THE TOWN ITSELF ITS WHITE WALLS RUNNING WITH DAMP GAVE OFF ANOTHER CLOUD OF STEAM THAT BILLOWED OUT TO MEET THE FIRST. WHICHEVER WAY YOU TURNED YOU SEEMED TO BE BREATHING WATER YOU COULD DRINK THE VERY AIR.

LOOKING AT THIS DROWNED SEA SEEING IN DECEMBER AN ALGIERS THAT WAS STILL FOR ME THE CITY OF SUMMERS I WALKED ABOUT AND WAITED. I HAD FLED FROM THE NIGHT OF EUROPE FROM A WINTER OF FACES. BUT EVEN THE TOWN OF SUMMERS WAS EMPTIED OF ITS LAUGHTER OFFERING ME ONLY HUNCHED AND STREAMING BACKS. IN THE EVENING IN THE FIERCELY LIT CAFÉS WHERE I SOUGHT REFUGE I READ MY AGE ON FACES I RECOGNIZED WITHOUT KNOWING THEIR NAMES. ALL I KNEW WAS THAT THESE MEN HAD BEEN YOUNG WHEN I WAS AND THAT NOW THEY WERE YOUNG NO LONGER.

I STAYED ON THOUGH WITHOUT ANY CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR EXCEPT PERHAPS THE MOMENT WHEN I COULD GO BACK TO TIPASA. IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT FOLLY AND ONE THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS PUNISHED TO GO BACK TO THE PLACES OF ONE’S YOUTH TO WANT TO RELIVE AT FORTY THE THINGS ONE LOVED OR GREATLY ENJOYED AT TWENTY. BUT I WAS AWARE OF THIS FOLLY. I HAD ALREADY BEEN BACK TO TIPASA ONCE NOT LONG AFTER THOSE WAR YEARS THAT MARKED FOR ME THE END OF MY YOUTH. I HOPED I THINK TO REDISCOVER THERE A LIBERTY I WAS UNABLE TO FORGET. HERE MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO I HAD SPENT WHOLE MORNINGS WANDERING AMONG THE RUINS BREATHING THE SCENT OF ABSINTHE WARMING MYSELF AGAINST THE STONES DISCOVERING THE TINY SHORT-LIVED ROSES THAT SURVIVE IN SPRINGTIME. ONLY AT NOON WHEN EVEN THE CRICKETS ARE SILENCED BY THE HEAT WOULD I FLEE FROM THE AVID BLAZE OF AN ALL-CONSUMING LIGHT. SOMETIMES AT NIGHT I WOULD SLEEP OPEN-EYED BENEATH A SKY FLOWING WITH STARS. I WAS ALIVE AT THOSE MOMENTS. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER I FOUND MY RUINS AGAIN. A FEW STEPS FROM THE FIRST WAVES I FOLLOWED THE STREETS OF THE FORGOTTEN CITY ACROSS THE FIELDS COVERED WITH BITTER TREES; AND ON THE HILLS OVERLOOKING THE BAY COULD STILL CARESS THEIR PILLARS WHICH WERE THE COLOR OF BREAD. BUT NOW THE RUINS WERE SURROUNDED BY BARBED WIRE AND COULD BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH OFFICIAL ENTRANCES. IT WAS ALSO FORBIDDEN FOR REASONS SANCTIONED IT WOULD SEEM BY MORALITY TO WALK THERE AFTER DARK; BY DAY ONE WOULD MEET AN OFFICIAL GUARD. THAT MORNING DOUBTLESS BY CHANCE IT WAS RAINING ACROSS THE WHOLE SWEEP OF THE RUINS.

BEWILDERED WALKING THROUGH THE LONELY RAIN-SOAKED COUNTRYSIDE I TRIED AT LEAST TO RECOVER THE STRENGTH THAT HAS SO FAR NEVER FAILED ME THAT HELPS ME TO ACCEPT WHAT IS ONCE I HAVE REALIZED I CANNOT CHANGE IT. I COULD NOT OF COURSE TRAVEL BACKWARD THROUGH TIME AND RESTORE TO THIS WORLD THE FACE I HAD LOVED WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN A SINGLE DAY A LONG TIME BEFORE. ON THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER 1939 I DID NOT GO TO GREECE AS I HAD PLANNED. INSTEAD THE WAR ENVELOPED US THEN GREECE ITSELF. THIS DISTANCE THESE YEARS SEPARATING THE WARM RUINS FROM THE BARBED WIRE WERE ALSO WITHIN ME AS I STOOD THAT DAY STARING AT TOMBS FILLED WITH BLACK WATER OR BENEATH THE DRIPPING TAMARISK TREES. RAISED ABOVE ALL IN THE SPECTACLE OF A BEAUTY THAT WAS MY ONLY WEALTH I HAD BEGUN IN PLENTY. THE BARBED WIRE CAME LATER—I MEAN TYRANNIES WAR POLICINGS THE TIME OF REVOLT. WE HAD HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH NIGHT: THE BEAUTY OF DAYTIME WAS ONLY A MEMORY. AND IN THIS MUDDY TIPASA EVEN THE MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM. NO ROOM NOW FOR BEAUTY FULLNESS OR YOUTH! IN THE LIGHT CAST BY THE FLAMES THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY SHOWN ITS WRINKLES AND ITS AFFLICTIONS OLD AND NEW. IT HAD SUDDENLY GROWN OLD AND WE HAD TOO. I KNEW THE ARDOR I HAD COME IN SEARCH OF COULD ONLY BE ROUSED IN SOMEONE NOT EXPECTING IT. THERE IS NO LOVE WITHOUT A LITTLE INNOCENCE. WHERE WAS INNOCENCE? EMPIRES WERE CRUMBLING MEN AND NATIONS WERE TEARING AT ONE ANOTHER’S THROATS; OUR MOUTHS WERE DIRTIED. INNOCENT AT FIRST WITHOUT KNOWING IT NOW WE WERE UNINTENTIONALLY GUILTY: THE MORE WE KNEW THE GREATER THE MYSTERY. THIS IS WHY WE BUSIED OURSELVES OH MOCKERY WITH MORALITY. FRAIL IN SPIRIT I DREAMED OF VIRTUE! IN THE DAYS OF INNOCENCE I DID NOT KNOW MORALITY EXISTED. NOW I KNEW IT DID AND COULD NOT LIVE UP TO IT. ON THE PROMONTORY I HAD LOVED IN FORMER DAYS BETWEEN THE DRENCHED PILLARS OF THE RUINED TEMPLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING BEHIND SOMEONE WHOSE FOOTSTEPS I COULD STILL HEAR ON THE TOMBSTONES AND MOSAICS BUT WHOM I WOULD NEVER CATCH UP WITH AGAIN. I WENT BACK TO PARIS AND STAYED FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE RETURNING HOME AGAIN.

DURING ALL THESE YEARS HOWEVER I HAD A VAGUE FEELING OF MISSING SOMETHING. ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO LOVE INTENSELY YOUR LIFE IS SPENT IN SEARCH OF THE SAME LIGHT AND THE SAME ARDOR. TO GIVE UP BEAUTY AND THE SENSUAL HAPPINESS THAT COMES WITH IT AND DEVOTE ONE’S SELF EXCLUSIVELY TO UNHAPPINESS REQUIRES A NOBILITY I LACK. BUT AFTER ALL NOTHING IS TRUE THAT COMPELS US TO MAKE IT EXCLUSIVE. ISOLATED BEAUTY ENDS IN GRIMACES SOLITARY JUSTICE IN OPPRESSION. ANYONE WHO SEEKS TO SERVE THE ONE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE OTHER SERVES NO ONE NOT EVEN HIMSELF AND IN THE END IS DOUBLY THE SERVANT OF INJUSTICE. A DAY COMES WHEN BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN INFLEXIBLE NOTHING AMAZES US ANYMORE EVERYTHING IS KNOWN AND OUR LIFE IS SPENT IN STARTING AGAIN. IT IS A TIME OF EXILE DRY LIVES DEAD SOULS. TO COME BACK TO LIFE WE NEED GRACE A HOMELAND OR TO FORGET OURSELVES. ON CERTAIN MORNINGS AS WE TURN A CORNER AN EXQUISITE DEW FALLS ON OUR HEART AND THEN VANISHES. BUT THE FRESHNESS LINGERS AND THIS ALWAYS IS WHAT THE HEART NEEDS. I HAD TO COME BACK ONCE AGAIN.

AND IN ALGIERS A SECOND TIME STILL WALKING UNDER THE SAME DOWNPOUR THAT I FELT HAD NOT STOPPED SINCE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY FINAL DEPARTURE IN THE MIDST OF THIS IMMENSE MELANCHOLY SMELLING OF RAIN AND SEA IN SPITE OF THE MISTY SKY THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE’S BACKS FLEEING BENEATH THE DELUGE THE CAFÉS WHOSE SULPHUROUS LIGHT DECOMPOSED EVERYONE’S FACE I PERSISTED IN MY HOPES. ANYWAY DIDN’T I KNOW THAT RAIN IN ALGIERS ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS AS IF IT WOULD GO ON FOREVER NONETHELESS DOES STOP SUDDENLY LIKE THE RIVERS IN MY COUNTRY THAT SWELL TO A FLOOD IN TWO HOURS DEVASTATE ACRES OF LAND AND DRY UP AGAIN IN AN INSTANT? ONE EVENING IN FACT THE RAIN STOPPED. I WAITED STILL ONE MORE NIGHT. A LIQUID MORNING ROSE DAZZLING OVER THE PURE SEA. FROM THE SKY FRESH AS A ROSE WASHED AND REWASHED BY THE WATERS REDUCED BY EACH SUCCESSIVE LAUNDERING TO ITS MOST DELICATE AND CLEAREST TEXTURE A QUIVERING LIGHT FELL ENDOWING EACH HOUSE EACH TREE WITH A PALPABLE SHAPE AND A MAGIC NEWNESS. THE EARTH MUST HAVE RISEN IN JUST SUCH A LIGHT THE MORNING THE WORLD WAS BORN. ONCE AGAIN I SET OUT FOR TIPASA.

THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THESE SIXTY-NINE KILOMETERS OF HIGHWAY THAT IS NOT FILLED FOR ME WITH MEMORIES AND SENSATIONS. A VIOLENT CHILDHOOD ADOLESCENT DAYDREAMS TO THE HUM OF THE BUS’S ENGINES MORNINGS THE FRESHNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS BEACHES YOUNG MUSCLES ALWAYS TENSED THE SLIGHT ANGUISH THAT THE EVENING BRINGS TO A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD HEART THE DESIRE TO LIVE GLORY AND ALWAYS THE SAME SKY FOR MONTHS ON END WITH ITS INEXHAUSTIBLE STRENGTH AND LIGHT AS COMPANION TO THE YEARS A SKY INSATIABLE ONE BY ONE DEVOURING VICTIMS LYING CRUCIFIED UPON THE BEACH AT THE FUNEREAL HOUR OF NOON. ALWAYS THE SAME SEA AS WELL ALMOST IMPALPABLE IN THE MORNING AIR GLIMPSED AGAIN ON THE HORIZON AS SOON AS THE ROAD LEAVING THE SAHEL AND ITS HILLS WITH THEIR BRONZE-COLORED VINEYARDS DIPPED DOWN TOWARD THE COAST. BUT I DID NOT STOP TO LOOK AT IT. I WANTED TO SEE THE CHENOUA AGAIN—THAT HEAVY SOLID MOUNTAIN CARVED ALL IN ONE PIECE AND RUNNING ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF TIPASA BAY BEFORE DESCENDING INTO THE SEA. YOU SEE IT FROM FAR AWAY LONG BEFORE YOU GET THERE AS A LIGHT BLUE HAZE STILL MINGLING WITH THE SEA. BUT GRADUALLY IT CONDENSES AS YOU COME NEARER UNTIL IT TAKES ON THE COLOR OF THE WATERS SURROUNDING IT LIKE AN IMMENSE AND MOTIONLESS WAVE BRUTALLY CAUGHT IN THE VERY ACT OF BREAKING OVER A SUDDENLY CALM SEA. NEARER STILL ALMOST AT THE GATES OF TIPASA YOU SEE ITS FROWNING MASS BROWN AND GREEN THE OLD UNSHAKABLE MOSS-COVERED GOD PORT AND HAVEN FOR ITS SONS OF WHOM I AM ONE. I WAS GAZING AT IT AS I FINALLY CROSSED THE BARBED WIRE AND STOOD AMONG THE RUINS. AND IN THE GLORIOUS DECEMBER LIGHT AS HAPPENS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE IN LIVES THAT MAY LATER BE DESCRIBED AS HEAPED WITH EVERY BLESSING I FOUND EXACTLY WHAT I HAD COME IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING WHICH IN SPITE OF TIME AND IN SPITE OF THE WORLD WAS OFFERED TO ME AND TRULY TO ME ALONE IN THIS DESERTED NATURE. FROM THE OLIVE-STREWN FORUM ONE COULD SEE THE VILLAGE DOWN BELOW. NOT A SOUND CAME FROM IT; WISPS OF SMOKE ROSE IN THE LIMPID AIR. THE SEA ALSO LAY SILENT AS IF BREATHLESS BENEATH THE UNENDING SHOWER OF COLD GLITTERING LIGHT. FROM THE CHENOUA A DISTANT COCK CROW ALONE SANG THE FRAGILE GLORY OF THE DAY. ACROSS THE RUINS AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE THERE WERE NOTHING BUT PITTED STONES AND ABSINTHE PLANTS TREES AND PERFECT COLUMNS IN THE TRANSPARENCE OF THE CRYSTAL AIR. IT WAS AS IF THE MORNING STOOD STILL AS IF THE SUN HAD STOPPED FOR AN IMMEASURABLE MOMENT. IN THIS LIGHT AND SILENCE YEARS OF NIGHT AND FURY MELTED SLOWLY AWAY. I LISTENED TO AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN SOUND WITHIN MYSELF AS IF MY HEART HAD LONG BEEN STOPPED AND WAS NOW GENTLY BEGINNING TO BEAT AGAIN. AND NOW AWAKE I RECOGNIZED ONE BY ONE THE IMPERCEPTIBLE SOUNDS THAT MADE UP THE SILENCE: THE BASSO CONTINUO OF THE BIRDS THE SHORT LIGHT SIGHING OF THE SEA AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS THE VIBRATION OF THE TREES THE BLIND SONG OF THE COLUMNS THE WHISPERING OF THE ABSINTHE PLANTS THE FURTIVE LIZARDS. I HEARD ALL THIS AND ALSO FELT THE WAVES OF HAPPINESS RISING UP WITHIN ME. I FELT THAT I HAD AT LAST COME BACK TO HARBOR FOR A MOMENT AT LEAST AND THAT FROM NOW ON THIS MOMENT WOULD NEVER END. BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE SUN ROSE VISIBLY A DEGREE HIGHER IN THE SKY. A BLACKBIRD CHIRPED ITS BRIEF PRELUDE AND IMMEDIATELY FROM ALL AROUND BIRD VOICES EXPLODED WITH A STRENGTH A JUBILATION A JOYFUL DISCORD AN INFINITE DELIGHT. THE DAY MOVED ON. IT WAS TO CARRY ME THROUGH TILL EVENING.

AT NOON ON THE HALF-SANDY SLOPES STREWN WITH HELIOTROPES LIKE A FOAM THAT THE FURIOUS WAVES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THEIR RETREAT I GAZED AT THE SEA GENTLY RISING AND FALLING AS IF EXHAUSTED AND QUENCHED TWO THIRSTS THAT CANNOT BE LONG NEGLECTED IF ALL ONE’S BEING IS NOT TO DRY UP THE THIRST TO LOVE AND THE THIRST TO ADMIRE. FOR THERE IS ONLY MISFORTUNE IN NOT BEING LOVED; THERE IS MISERY IN NOT LOVING. ALL OF US TODAY ARE DYING OF THIS MISERY. THIS IS BECAUSE BLOOD AND HATRED LAY BARE THE HEART ITSELF; THE LONG DEMAND FOR JUSTICE EXHAUSTS EVEN THE LOVE THAT GAVE IT BIRTH. IN THE CLAMOR WE LIVE IN LOVE IS IMPOSSIBLE AND JUSTICE NOT ENOUGH. THAT IS WHY EUROPE HATES THE DAYLIGHT AND CAN DO NOTHING BUT CONFRONT ONE INJUSTICE WITH ANOTHER. IN ORDER TO PREVENT JUSTICE FROM SHRIVELING UP FROM BECOMING NOTHING BUT A MAGNIFICENT ORANGE WITH A DRY BITTER PULP I DISCOVERED ONE MUST KEEP A FRESHNESS AND A SOURCE OF JOY INTACT WITHIN LOVING THE DAYLIGHT THAT INJUSTICE LEAVES UNSCATHED AND RETURNING TO THE FRAY WITH THIS LIGHT AS A TROPHY. HERE ONCE MORE I FOUND AN ANCIENT BEAUTY A YOUNG SKY AND MEASURED MY GOOD FORTUNE AS I REALIZED AT LAST THAT IN THE WORST YEARS OF OUR MADNESS THE MEMORY OF THIS SKY HAD NEVER LEFT ME. IT WAS THIS THAT IN THE END HAD SAVED ME FROM DESPAIR. I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THE RUINS OF TIPASA WERE YOUNGER THAN OUR DRYDOCKS OR OUR DEBRIS. IN TIPASA THE WORLD IS BORN AGAIN EACH DAY IN A LIGHT ALWAYS NEW. OH LIGHT! THE CRY OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN CLASSICAL TRAGEDY WHO COME FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR DESTINIES. I KNEW NOW THAT THEIR FINAL REFUGE WAS ALSO OURS. IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER I FINALLY LEARNED THAT WITHIN ME THERE LAY AN INVINCIBLE SUMMER.

—
ONCE MORE I LEFT TIPASA RETURNING TO EUROPE AND ITS STRUGGLES. BUT THE MEMORY OF THAT DAY SUSTAINS ME STILL AND HELPS ME MEET BOTH JOY AND SORROW WITH EQUANIMITY. IN THE DIFFICULT TIMES WE FACE WHAT MORE CAN I HOPE FOR THAN THE POWER TO EXCLUDE NOTHING AND TO LEARN TO WEAVE FROM STRANDS OF BLACK AND WHITE ONE ROPE TAUTENED TO THE BREAKING POINT? IN EVERYTHING I’VE DONE OR SAID SO FAR I SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THESE TWO FORCES EVEN WHEN THEY CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DENY THE LIGHT INTO WHICH I WAS BORN AND YET I HAVE NOT WISHED TO REJECT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF OUR TIME. IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO SET AGAINST THE GENTLE NAME TIPASA OTHER NAMES MORE SONOROUS AND MORE CRUEL: THERE IS FOR MAN TODAY AN INNER PATH THAT I KNOW WELL FROM HAVING TRAVELED BOTH WAYS UPON IT WHICH LEADS FROM THE SUMMITS OF THE MIND TO THE CAPITALS OF CRIME. AND DOUBTLESS ONE CAN ALWAYS REST SLEEP ON THE HILLSIDE OR SETTLE INTO CRIME. BUT IF WE GIVE UP A PART OF WHAT EXISTS WE MUST OURSELVES GIVE UP BEING; WE MUST THEN GIVE UP LIVING OR LOVING EXCEPT BY PROXY. THUS THERE IS A WILL TO LIVE WITHOUT REFUSING ANYTHING LIFE OFFERS: THE VIRTUE I HONOR MOST IN THIS WORLD. FROM TIME TO TIME AT LEAST IT’S TRUE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PRACTICED IT. SINCE FEW TIMES REQUIRE TO THE EXTENT OURS DOES THAT ONE BE AS EQUAL TO THE BEST AS TO THE WORST TO AVOID NOTHING AND KEEP A DOUBLE MEMORY ALIVE IS PRECISELY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO. YES THERE IS BEAUTY AND THERE ARE THE HUMILIATED. WHATEVER DIFFICULTIES THE ENTERPRISE MAY PRESENT I WOULD LIKE NEVER TO BE UNFAITHFUL EITHER TO THE ONE OR THE OTHER.

BUT THIS STILL SOUNDS LIKE ETHICS AND WE LIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT TRANSCENDS ETHICS. IF WE COULD NAME IT WHAT SILENCE WOULD FOLLOW! EAST OF TIPASA THE HILL OF SAINTE-SALSA EVENING HAS COME TO LIFE. IT IS STILL LIGHT OF COURSE BUT AN INVISIBLE WANING OF THE LIGHT ANNOUNCES THE SUNSET. A WIND RISES GENTLE AS THE NIGHT AND SUDDENLY THE UNTROUBLED SEA CHOOSES ITS WAY AND FLOWS LIKE A GREAT BARREN RIVER ACROSS THE HORIZON. THE SKY DARKENS. THEN BEGINS THE MYSTERY THE GODS OF NIGHT AND WHAT LIES BEYOND PLEASURE. BUT HOW CAN THIS BE EXPRESSED? THE LITTLE COIN I CARRY BACK FROM HERE HAS ONE CLEAR SIDE THE FACE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT REMINDS ME OF WHAT I’VE LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF THIS DAY WHILE THE OTHER SIDE WHICH I FEEL BENEATH MY FINGERS HOMEWARD BOUND HAS BEEN EATEN AWAY. WHAT DOES THIS LIPLESS MOUTH EXPRESS IF NOT WHAT ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS VOICE WITHIN ME SAYS THAT DAILY TEACHES ME MY IGNORANCE AND MY HAPPINESS:

THE SECRET I AM LOOKING FOR IS BURIED IN A VALLEY OF OLIVE TREES BENEATH THE GRASS AND COLD VIOLETS AROUND AN OLD HOUSE THAT SMELLS OF VINES. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE WANDERED OVER THIS VALLEY AND OVER OTHERS LIKE IT QUESTIONING DUMB GOATHERDS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF EMPTY RUINS. SOMETIMES WHEN THE FIRST STAR SHINES IN A STILL CLEAR SKY BENEATH A RAIN OF DELICATE LIGHT I HAVE THOUGHT THAT I KNEW. I DID KNOW IN FACT. PERHAPS I STILL KNOW. BUT NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN THIS SECRET DOUBTLESS I MYSELF DO NOT DESIRE IT AND I CANNOT CUT MYSELF OFF FROM MY OWN PEOPLE. I LIVE WITH MY FAMILY WHO BELIEVE THEY REIGN OVER RICH AND HIDEOUS CITIES BUILT OF STONES AND MISTS. DAY AND NIGHT IT RAISES ITS VOICE AND EVERYTHING YIELDS BENEATH IT WHILE IT BOWS DOWN TO NOTHING: IT IS DEAF TO ALL SECRETS. ITS POWER SUSTAINS ME AND YET BORES ME AND I COME TO BE WEARY OF ITS CRIES. BUT ITS UNHAPPINESS IS MY OWN WE ARE OF THE SAME BLOOD. I TOO AM SICK AND AM I NOT A NOISY ACCOMPLICE WHO HAS CRIED OUT AMONG THE STONES? THUS I TRY TO FORGET I MARCH THROUGH OUR CITIES OF IRON AND FIRE I SMILE BRAVELY AT THE NIGHT I WELCOME THE STORMS I WILL BE FAITHFUL. IN FACT I HAVE FORGOTTEN: HENCEFORTH I SHALL BE DEAF AND ACTIVE. BUT PERHAPS ONE DAY WHEN WE ARE READY TO DIE OF IGNORANCE AND EXHAUSTION I SHALL BE ABLE TO RENOUNCE OUR SHRIEKING TOMBS TO GO AND LIE DOWN IN THE VALLEY UNDER THE UNCHANGING LIGHT AND LEARN FOR ONE LAST TIME WHAT I KNOW.

1953


I GREW UP WITH THE SEA AND POVERTY FOR ME WAS SUMPTUOUS; THEN I LOST THE SEA AND FOUND ALL LUXURIES GRAY AND POVERTY UNBEARABLE. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN WAITING. I WAIT FOR THE HOMEBOUND SHIPS THE HOUSE OF THE WATERS THE LIMPIDITY OF DAY. I WAIT PATIENTLY AM POLITE WITH ALL MY STRENGTH. I AM SEEN WALKING BY ON FINE SOPHISTICATED STREETS I ADMIRE LANDSCAPES I APPLAUD LIKE EVERYONE SHAKE HANDS BUT IT IS NOT I WHO SPEAK. MEN PRAISE ME I DREAM A LITTLE THEY INSULT ME I SCARCELY SHOW SURPRISE. THEN I FORGET AND SMILE AT THE MAN WHO INSULTED ME OR AM TOO COURTEOUS IN GREETING THE PERSON I LOVE. CAN I HELP IT IF ALL I REMEMBER IS ONE IMAGE? FINALLY THEY SUMMON ME TO TELL THEM WHO I AM. “NOTHING YET NOTHING YET…”

I SURPASS MYSELF AT FUNERALS. TRULY I EXCEL. I WALK SLOWLY THROUGH THE IRON-STREWN SUBURBS TAKING THE WIDE LANES PLANTED WITH CEMENT TREES THAT LEAD TO HOLES IN THE COLD GROUND. THERE BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY REDDENED BANDAGE OF THE SKY I WATCH BOLD WORKMEN INTER MY FRIENDS BENEATH SIX FEET OF EARTH. IF I TOSS THE FLOWER A CLAY-COVERED HAND HOLDS OUT TO ME IT NEVER MISSES THE GRAVE. MY PIETY IS EXACT MY FEELINGS AS THEY SHOULD BE MY HEAD SUITABLY INCLINED. I AM ADMIRED FOR FINDING JUST THE RIGHT WORD. BUT I TAKE NO CREDIT: I AM WAITING.

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES I STUMBLE I LOSE MY TOUCH SUCCESS EVADES ME. WHAT DOES IT MATTER I AM ALONE THEN. I WAKE UP AT NIGHT AND STILL HALF ASLEEP THINK I HEAR THE SOUND OF WAVES THE BREATHING OF WATERS. FULLY AWAKE I RECOGNIZE THE WIND IN THE TREES AND THE SAD MURMUR OF THE EMPTY TOWN. AFTERWARD ALL MY ART IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HIDE MY ANGUISH OR CLOTHE IT IN THE PREVAILING FASHION.

AT OTHER TIMES IT’S THE OPPOSITE AND I AM HELPED. ON CERTAIN DAYS IN NEW YORK LOST AT THE BOTTOM OF THOSE STONE AND STEEL SHAFTS WHERE MILLIONS OF MEN WANDER I WOULD RUN FROM ONE SHAFT TO THE NEXT WITHOUT SEEING WHERE THEY ENDED UNTIL EXHAUSTED I WAS SUSTAINED ONLY BY THE HUMAN MASS SEEKING ITS WAY OUT. BUT EACH TIME THERE WAS THE DISTANT HONKING OF A TUGBOAT TO REMIND ME THAT THIS EMPTY WELL OF A CITY WAS AN ISLAND AND THAT OFF THE TIP OF THE BATTERY THE WATER OF MY BAPTISM LAY IN WAIT FOR ME BLACK AND ROTTING COVERED WITH HOLLOW CORKS.

THUS I WHO OWN NOTHING WHO HAVE GIVEN AWAY MY FORTUNE WHO CAMP IN ALL MY HOUSES AM STILL HEAPED WHEN I CHOOSE WITH EVERY BLESSING; I CAN SET SAIL AT ANY HOUR A STRANGER TO DESPAIR. THERE IS NO COUNTRY FOR THOSE WHO DESPAIR BUT I KNOW THAT THE SEA PRECEDES AND FOLLOWS ME AND I HOLD MY MADNESS READY. THOSE WHO LOVE AND ARE SEPARATED CAN LIVE IN GRIEF BUT THIS IS NOT DESPAIR: THEY KNOW THAT LOVE EXISTS. THIS IS WHY I SUFFER DRY-EYED IN EXILE I AM STILL WAITING. A DAY COMES AT LAST…

THE SAILORS’ BARE FEET BEAT SOFTLY ON THE DECK. WE ARE SETTING SAIL AT DAYBREAK. THE MOMENT WE LEAVE THE HARBOR A SHORT GUSTY WIND VIGOROUSLY BRUSHES THE SEA WHICH CURLS BACKWARD IN SMALL FOAMLESS WAVES. A LITTLE LATER THE WIND FRESHENS AND STREWS THE SEA WITH SWIFTLY VANISHING CAMELLIAS. THUS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING WE HEAR OUR SAILS SLAPPING ABOVE A CHEERFUL POND. THE WATERS ARE HEAVY SCALY COVERED WITH COOL FROTH. FROM TIME TO TIME THE WAVES LAP AGAINST THE BOW; A BITTER UNCTUOUS FOAM THE GODS’ SALIVA FLOWS ALONG THE WOOD AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE WATER WHERE IT SCATTERS INTO SHAPES THAT DIE AND ARE REBORN THE HIDE OF SOME WHITE AND BLUE COW AN EXHAUSTED BEAST THAT FLOATS FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR WAKE.

—
EVER SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE SEAGULLS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING OUR SHIP APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT ALMOST WITHOUT MOVING THEIR WINGS. THEIR FINE STRAIGHT NAVIGATION SCARCELY LEANS UPON THE BREEZE. SUDDENLY A LOUD PLOP AT THE LEVEL OF THE KITCHENS STIRS UP A GREEDY ALARM AMONG THE BIRDS THROWING THEIR FINE FLIGHT INTO CONFUSION AND SENDING UP A FIRE OF WHITE WINGS. THE SEAGULLS WHIRL MADLY IN EVERY DIRECTION AND THEN WITH NO LOSS OF SPEED DROP FROM THE FIGHT ONE BY ONE AND DIVE TOWARD THE SEA. A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY ARE TOGETHER AGAIN ON THE WATER A QUARRELSOME FARMYARD THAT WE LEAVE BEHIND NESTING IN THE HOLLOW OF THE WAVE SLOWLY PICKING THROUGH THE MANNA OF THE SCRAPS.

—
AT NOON UNDER A DEAFENING SUN THE SEA IS SO EXHAUSTED IT SCARCELY FINDS THE STRENGTH TO RISE. WHEN IT FALLS BACK ON ITSELF IT MAKES THE SILENCE WHISTLE. AFTER AN HOUR’S COOKING THE PALE WATER A VAST WHITE-HOT IRON SHEET SIZZLES. IN A MINUTE IT WILL TURN AND OFFER ITS DAMP SIDE NOW HIDDEN IN WAVES AND DARKNESS TO THE SUN.

—
WE PASS THE GATES OF HERCULES THE HEADLAND WHERE ANTAEUS DIED. BEYOND THERE IS OCEAN EVERYWHERE; ON ONE SIDE WE PASS THE HORN AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE MERIDIANS WED THE LATITUDES THE PACIFIC DRINKS THE ATLANTIC. AT ONCE SETTING COURSE FOR VANCOUVER WE SAIL SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTH SEAS. A FEW CABLE LENGTHS AWAY EASTER ISLAND DESOLATION AND THE NEW HEBRIDES FILE PAST US IN CONVOY. SUDDENLY ONE MORNING THE SEAGULLS DISAPPEAR. WE ARE FAR FROM ANY LAND AND ALONE WITH OUR SAILS AND OUR ENGINES.

—
ALONE ALSO WITH THE HORIZON. THE WAVES COME FROM THE INVISIBLE EAST PATIENTLY ONE BY ONE; THEY REACH US AND THEN PATIENTLY SET OFF AGAIN FOR THE UNKNOWN WEST ONE BY ONE. A LONG VOYAGE WITH NO BEGINNING AND NO END…RIVERS AND STREAMS PASS BY THE SEA PASSES AND REMAINS. THIS IS HOW ONE OUGHT TO LOVE FAITHFUL AND FLEETING. I WED THE SEA.

—
THE HIGH SEAS. THE SUN SINKS AND IS SWALLOWED BY THE FOG LONG BEFORE IT REACHES THE HORIZON. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THE SEA IS PINK ON ONE SIDE AND BLUE ON THE OTHER. THEN THE WATERS GROW DARKER. THE SCHOONER SLIDES MINUTE OVER THE SURFACE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE OF THICK TARNISHED METAL. AND AT THE MOST PEACEFUL HOUR AS EVENING COMES HUNDREDS OF PORPOISES EMERGE FROM THE WATER FROLIC AROUND US FOR A MOMENT THEN FLEE TO THE HORIZON WHERE THERE ARE NO MEN. WITH THEM GONE SILENCE AND THE ANGUISH OF PRIMITIVE WATERS ARE WHAT REMAIN.

—
A LITTLE LATER STILL WE MEET AN ICEBERG ON THE TROPIC. INVISIBLE TO BE SURE AFTER ITS LONG VOYAGE IN THESE WARM WATERS BUT STILL EFFECTIVE: IT PASSES TO STARBOARD WHERE THE RIGGING IS BRIEFLY COVERED WITH A FROSTY DEW WHILE TO PORT THE DAY DIES WITHOUT MOISTURE.

—
NIGHT DOES NOT FALL AT SEA. IT RISES RATHER TOWARD THE STILL PALE SKY FROM THE DEPTHS OF WATERS AN ALREADY DROWNED SUN GRADUALLY DARKENS WITH ITS THICK ASHES. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT VENUS SHINES ALONE ABOVE THE BLACK WAVES. IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE STARS SWARM IN THE LIQUID NIGHT.

—
THE MOON HAS RISEN. FIRST IT LIGHTS THE WATER’S SURFACE GENTLY THEN CLIMBS HIGHER AND INSCRIBES ITSELF IN THE SUPPLE WATER. AT LAST AT ITS ZENITH IT LIGHTS A WHOLE CORRIDOR OF SEA A RICH RIVER OF MILK WHICH WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP STREAMS DOWN INEXHAUSTIBLY TOWARD US ACROSS THE DARK OCEAN. HERE IS THE FAITHFUL NIGHT THE COOL NIGHT I CALLED FOR IN THE ROLLICKING LIGHTS THE ALCOHOL THE TUMULT OF DESIRE.

—
WE SAIL ACROSS SPACES SO VAST THEY SEEM UNENDING. SUN AND MOON RISE AND FALL IN TURN ON THE SAME THREAD OF LIGHT AND NIGHT. DAYS AT SEA AS SIMILAR EACH TO THE OTHER AS HAPPINESS…

THIS LIFE REBELLIOUS TO FORGETFULNESS REBELLIOUS TO MEMORY THAT STEVENSON SPEAKS OF.

—
DAWN. WE SAIL PERPENDICULARLY ACROSS THE TROPIC OF CANCER THE WATERS GROAN AND ARE CONVULSED. DAY BREAKS OVER A SURGING SEA FULL OF STEEL SPANGLES. THE SKY IS WHITE WITH MIST AND HEAT WITH A DEAD BUT UNBEARABLE GLARE AS IF THE SUN HAD TURNED LIQUID IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CLOUDS OVER THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF THE CELESTIAL VAULT. A SICK SKY OVER A DECOMPOSING SEA. AS THE DAY DRAWS ON THE HEAT GROWS IN THE WHITE AIR. ALL DAY LONG OUR BOW NOSES OUT CLOUDS OF FLYING FISH TINY IRON BIRDS FORCING THEM FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES IN THE WAVES.

—
IN THE AFTERNOON WE MEET A STEAMER BOUND FOR HOME. THE SALUTE OUR FOGHORNS EXCHANGE WITH THREE GREAT PREHISTORIC HOOTS THE SIGNALS OF PASSENGERS LOST AT SEA WARNING THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS PRESENT THE GRADUALLY INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SHIPS THEIR SEPARATION AT LAST ON THE MALEVOLENT WATERS ALL THIS FILLS THE HEART WITH PAIN. THESE STUBBORN MADMEN CLINGING TO PLANKS TOSSED UPON THE MANE OF IMMENSE OCEANS IN PURSUIT OF DRIFTING ISLANDS: WHAT MAN WHO CHERISHES SOLITUDE AND THE SEA WILL EVER KEEP HIMSELF FROM LOVING THEM?

—
IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC WE BEND BENEATH THE SAVAGE WINDS THAT BLOW ENDLESSLY FROM POLE TO POLE. EACH CRY WE UTTER IS LOST FLIES OFF INTO LIMITLESS SPACE. BUT THIS SHOUT CARRIED DAY AFTER DAY ON THE WINDS WILL FINALLY REACH LAND AT ONE OF THE FLATTENED ENDS OF THE EARTH AND ECHO TIMELESSLY AGAINST THE FROZEN WALLS UNTIL A MAN LOST SOMEWHERE IN HIS SHELL OF SNOW HEARS IT AND WANTS TO SMILE WITH HAPPINESS.

—
I WAS HALF ASLEEP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON SUN WHEN A TERRIBLE NOISE AWOKE ME. I SAW THE SUN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA THE WAVES REINING IN THE SURGING HEAVENS. SUDDENLY THE SEA WAS AFIRE THE SUN FLOWED IN LONG ICY DRAUGHTS DOWN MY THROAT. THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND WEPT AROUND ME. THEY LOVED BUT COULD NOT FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER. I RECOGNIZED THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS THAT DAY. I DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT ITS GOOD MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME BE EVIL AND ITS TRANSGRESSIONS BENEFICIAL. I REALIZED THAT DAY THAT THERE WERE TWO TRUTHS AND THAT ONE OF THEM OUGHT NEVER TO BE UTTERED.

—
THE CURIOUS AUSTRAL MOON LOOKING SLIGHTLY PARED KEEPS US COMPANY FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AND THEN SLIDES RAPIDLY FROM THE SKY INTO THE SEA WHICH SWALLOWS IT. THE SOUTHERN CROSS THE INFREQUENT STARS THE POROUS AIR REMAIN. AT THE SAME INSTANT THE WIND CEASES. THE SKY ROLLS AND PITCHES ABOVE OUR IMMOBILE MASTS. ENGINE DEAD SAILS HOVE TO WE ARE WHISTLING IN THE WARM NIGHT AS THE WATER BEATS AMICABLY AGAINST OUR SIDES. NO COMMANDS THE MACHINES ARE SILENT. WHY INDEED SHOULD WE CONTINUE AND WHY RETURN? OUR CUP RUNNETH OVER A MUTE RAPTURE LULLS US INVINCIBLY TO SLEEP. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE THIS WHEN ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED; WE MUST LET OURSELVES FLOW WITH THEM LIKE SWIMMERS WHO KEEP ON UNTIL EXHAUSTED. WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH? I HAVE ALWAYS CONCEALED IT FROM MYSELF. OH BITTER BED PRINCELY COUCH THE CROWN LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAS.

—
IN THE MORNING THE LUKEWARM WATER FOAMS GENTLY UNDER OUR PROPELLER. WE PUT ON SPEED. TOWARD NOON TRAVELING FROM DISTANT CONTINENTS A HERD OF WALRUSES CROSS OUR PATH OVERTAKE US AND SWIM RHYTHMICALLY TO THE NORTH FOLLOWED BY MULTICOLORED BIRDS WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME ALIGHT UPON THEIR TUSKS. THIS RUSTLING FOREST SLOWLY VANISHES ON THE HORIZON. A LITTLE LATER THE SEA IS COVERED WITH STRANGE YELLOW FLOWERS. TOWARD EVENING FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR WE ARE PRECEDED BY AN INVISIBLE SONG. COMFORTABLY I FALL ASLEEP.

—
ALL SAILS STRETCHED TO THE KEEN BREEZE WE SKIM ACROSS A CLEAR AND RIPPLING SEA. AT TOP SPEED OUR HELM GOES HARD TO PORT. AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL CORRECTING OUR COURSE AGAIN LISTING SO FAR TO STARBOARD THAT OUR SAILS SKIM THE WATER WE SAIL RAPIDLY ALONG THE SIDE OF A SOUTHERN CONTINENT I RECOGNIZE FROM HAVING ONCE FLOWN BLINDLY OVER IT IN THE BARBAROUS COFFIN OF AN AIRPLANE. I WAS AN IDLE KING AND MY CHARIOT DAWDLED; I WAITED FOR THE SEA BUT IT NEVER CAME. THE MONSTER ROARED TOOK OFF FROM THE GUANO FIELDS OF PERU HURLED ITSELF ABOVE THE BEACHES OF THE PACIFIC FLEW OVER THE FRACTURED WHITE VERTEBRAE OF THE ANDES AND THEN ABOVE THE HERDS OF FLIES THAT COVER THE IMMENSE ARGENTINIAN PLAIN LINKING IN ONE SWOOP THE MILK-DROWNED URUGUAYAN MEADOWS TO VENEZUELA’S BLACK RIVERS LANDING ROARING AGAIN QUIVERING WITH GREED AT THE SIGHT OF NEW EMPTY SPACES TO DEVOUR AND YET NEVER FAILING TO MOVE FORWARD OR AT LEAST DOING SO ONLY WITH A CONVULSED OBSTINATE SLOWNESS A FIXED WEARY AND INTOXICATED ENERGY. I FELT I WAS DYING IN THIS METALLIC CELL AND DREAMED OF BLOODSHED AND ORGIES. WITHOUT SPACE THERE IS NEITHER INNOCENCE NOR LIBERTY! WHEN A MAN CANNOT BREATHE PRISON MEANS DEATH OR MADNESS; WHAT CAN HE DO THERE BUT KILL AND POSSESS? BUT TODAY I HAVE ALL THE AIR I NEED ALL OUR SAILS SLAP IN THE BLUE AIR I AM GOING TO SHOUT AT THE SPEED WE’LL TOSS OUR SEXTANTS AND COMPASSES INTO THE SEA.

—
OUR SAILS ARE LIKE IRON UNDER THE IMPERIOUS WIND. THE COAST DRIFTS AT FULL SPEED BEFORE OUR EYES FORESTS OF ROYAL COCONUT TREES WHOSE FEET ARE BATHED BY EMERALD LAGOONS A QUIET BAY FULL OF RED SAILS MOONLIT BEACHES. GREAT BUILDINGS LOOM UP ALREADY CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE VIRGIN FOREST THAT BEGINS IN THE BACK YARDS; HERE AND THERE A YELLOW IPECAC OR A TREE WITH VIOLET BRANCHES BURSTS THROUGH A WINDOW; RIO FINALLY CRUMBLES AWAY BEHIND US AND THE MONKEYS OF THE TIJUCA WILL LAUGH AND GIBBER IN THE VEGETATION THAT WILL COVER ITS NEW RUINS. FASTER STILL ALONG WIDE BEACHES WHERE THE WAVES SPREAD OUT IN SHEAVES OF SAND FASTER STILL WHERE THE URUGUAYAN SHEEP WADE INTO THE SEA AND INSTANTLY TURN IT YELLOW. THEN ON THE ARGENTINIAN COAST GREAT COARSE HEAPS OF BURNING KINDLING SET UP AT REGULAR INTERVALS RAISE SLOWLY GRILLING HALVES OF OXEN TO THE SKY. AT NIGHT THE ICE FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO COMES AND BEATS FOR HOURS AGAINST OUR HULL THE SHIP HARDLY LOSES SPEED AND TACKS ABOUT. IN THE MORNING THE SINGLE WAVE OF THE PACIFIC WHOSE COLD FOAM BOILS GREEN AND WHITE FOR THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS ALONG THE CHILEAN COAST SLOWLY LIFTS US UP AND THREATENS TO WRECK US. THE HELM AVOIDS IT OVERTAKES THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS. IN THE SWEETISH EVENING THE FIRST MALAYAN BOATS COME OUT TO MEET US.

—
“TO SEA! TO SEA!” SHOUTED THE MARVELOUS BOYS IN ONE OF THE BOOKS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT BOOK EXCEPT THIS CRY. “TO SEA!” AND ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN INTO THE CORRIDOR OF THE RED SEA WHERE ON SILENT NIGHTS ONE CAN HEAR THE DESERT STONES SCORCHED IN THE DAYTIME FREEZE AND CRACK ONE BY ONE AS WE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT SEA IN WHICH ALL CRIES ARE HUSHED.

—
FINALLY ONE MORNING WE DROP ANCHOR IN A BAY FILLED WITH A STRANGE SILENCE BEACONED WITH FIXED SAILS. A FEW SEA BIRDS ARE QUARRELLING IN THE SKY OVER SCRAPS OF REEDS. WE SWIM ASHORE TO AN EMPTY BEACH; ALL DAY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND DRYING OFF ON THE SAND. WHEN EVENING COMES UNDER A SKY THAT TURNS GREEN AND FADES INTO THE DISTANCE THE SEA ALREADY CALM GROWS MORE PEACEFUL STILL. SHORT WAVES SHOWER VAPOROUS FOAM ON THE LUKEWARM SHORE. THE SEA BIRDS HAVE DISAPPEARED. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS SPACE OPEN TO A MOTIONLESS VOYAGE.

—
KNOWING THAT CERTAIN NIGHTS WHOSE SWEETNESS LINGERS WILL KEEP RETURNING TO THE EARTH AND SEA AFTER WE ARE GONE YES THIS HELPS US DIE. GREAT SEA EVER IN MOTION EVER VIRGIN MY RELIGION ALONG WITH NIGHT! IT WASHES AND SATIATES US IN ITS STERILE BILLOWS FREES US AND HOLDS US UPRIGHT. EACH BREAKER BRINGS ITS PROMISE ALWAYS THE SAME. WHAT DOES EACH SAY? IF I WERE TO DIE SURROUNDED BY COLD MOUNTAINS IGNORED BY THE WORLD AN OUTCAST AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH AT THE FINAL MOMENT THE SEA WOULD FLOOD MY CELL WOULD LIFT ME ABOVE MYSELF AND HELP ME DIE WITHOUT HATRED.

—
AT MIDNIGHT ALONE ON THE SHORE. A MOMENT MORE AND I SHALL SET SAIL. THE SKY ITSELF HAS WEIGHED ANCHOR WITH ALL ITS STARS LIKE THE SHIPS COVERED WITH LIGHTS WHICH AT THIS VERY HOUR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ILLUMINATE DARK HARBORS. SPACE AND SILENCE WEIGH EQUALLY UPON THE HEART. A SUDDEN LOVE A GREAT WORK A DECISIVE ACT A THOUGHT THAT TRANSFIGURES ALL THESE AT CERTAIN MOMENTS BRING THE SAME UNBEARABLE ANXIETY QUICKENED WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM. LIVING LIKE THIS IN THE DELICIOUS ANGUISH OF BEING IN EXQUISITE PROXIMITY TO A DANGER WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW IS THIS THE SAME AS RUSHING TO OUR DOOM? ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT RESPITE LET US RACE TO OUR DESTRUCTION.

—
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT I LIVED ON THE HIGH SEAS THREATENED AT THE HEART OF A ROYAL HAPPINESS.

IN ITSELF EVERY IDEA IS NEUTRAL OR SHOULD BE; BUT MAN ANIMATES IDEAS PROJECTS HIS FLAMES AND FLAWS INTO THEM; IMPURE TRANSFORMED INTO BELIEFS IDEAS TAKE THEIR PLACE IN TIME TAKE SHAPE AS EVENTS: THE TRAJECTORY IS COMPLETE FROM LOGIC TO EPILEPSY . . . WHENCE THE BIRTH OF IDEOLOGIES DOCTRINES DEADLY GAMES.

IDOLATERS BY INSTINCT WE CONVERT THE OBJECTS OF OUR DREAMS AND OUR INTERESTS INTO THE UNCONDITIONAL HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A PROCESSION OF FALSE ABSOLUTES A SERIES OF TEMPLES RAISED TO PRETEXTS A DEGRADATION OF THE MIND BEFORE THE IMPROBABLE. EVEN WHEN HE TURNS FROM RELIGION MAN REMAINS SUBJECT TO IT; DEPLETING HIMSELF TO CREATE FAKE GODS HE THEN FEVERISHLY ADOPTS THEM: HIS NEED FOR FICTION FOR MYTHOLOGY TRIUMPHS OVER EVIDENCE AND ABSURDITY ALIKE. HIS POWER TO ADORE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL HIS CRIMES: A MAN WHO LOVES A GOD UNDULY FORCES OTHER MEN TO LOVE HIS GOD EAGER TO EXTERMINATE THEM IF THEY REFUSE. THERE IS NO FORM OF INTOLERANCE OF PROSELYTISM OR IDEOLOGICAL INTRANSIGENCE WHICH FAILS TO REVEAL THE BESTIAL SUBSTRATUM OF ENTHUSIASM. ONCE MAN LOSES HIS FACULTY OF INDIFFERENCE HE BECOMES A POTENTIAL MURDERER; ONCE HE TRANSFORMS HIS IDEA INTO A GOD THE CONSEQUENCES ARE INCALCULABLE. WE KILL ONLY IN THE NAME OF A GOD OR OF HIS COUNTERFEITS: THE EXCESSES PROVOKED BY THE GODDESS REASON BY THE CONCEPT OF NATION CLASS OR RACE ARE AKIN TO THOSE OF THE INQUISITION OR OF THE REFORMATION. THE AGES OF FERVOR ABOUND IN BLOODY EXPLOITS: A SAINT TERESA COULD ONLY BE THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE AUTO-DA-FÉ A LUTHER OF THE REPRESSION OF THE PEASANTS’ REVOLT. IN EVERY MYSTIC OUTBURST THE MOANS OF VICTIMS PARALLEL THE MOANS OF ECSTASY. . . . SCAFFOLDS DUNGEONS JAILS FLOURISH ONLY IN THE SHADOW OF A FAITH—OF THAT NEED TO BELIEVE WHICH HAS INFESTED THE MIND FOREVER. THE DEVIL PALES BESIDE THE MAN WHO OWNS A TRUTH HIS TRUTH. WE ARE UNFAIR TO A NERO A TIBERIUS: IT WAS NOT THEY WHO INVENTED THE CONCEPT HERETIC: THEY WERE ONLY DEGENERATE DREAMERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE ENTERTAINED BY MASSACRES. THE REAL CRIMINALS ARE MEN WHO ESTABLISH AN ORTHODOXY ON THE RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL LEVEL MEN WHO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FAITHFUL AND THE SCHISMATIC.

WHEN WE REFUSE TO ADMIT THE INTERCHANGEABLE CHARACTER OF IDEAS BLOOD FLOWS . . . FIRM RESOLVES DRAW THE DAGGER; FIERY EYES PRESAGE SLAUGHTER. NO WAVERING MIND INFECTED WITH HAMLETISM WAS EVER PERNICIOUS: THE PRINCIPLE OF EVIL LIES IN THE WILL’S TENSION IN THE INCAPACITY FOR QUIETISM IN THE PROMETHEAN MEGALOMANIA OF A RACE THAT BURSTS WITH IDEALS THAT EXPLODES WITH ITS CONVICTIONS AND THAT IN RETURN FOR HAVING FORSAKEN DOUBT AND SLOTH—VICES NOBLER THAN ALL ITS VIRTUES-—HAS TAKEN THE PATH TO PERDITION INTO HISTORY THAT INDECENT ALLOY OF BANALITY AND APOCALYPSE. . . . HERE CERTITUDES ABOUND: SUPPRESS THEM BEST OF ALL SUPPRESS THEIR CONSEQUENCES AND YOU RECOVER PARADISE. WHAT IS THE FALL BUT THE PURSUIT OF A TRUTH AND THE ASSURANCE YOU HAVE FOUND IT THE PASSION FOR A DOGMA DOMICILE WITHIN A DOGMA? THE RESULT IS FANATICISM—FUNDAMENTAL DEFECT WHICH GIVES MAN THE CRAVING FOR EFFECTIVENESS FOR PROPHECY FOR TERROR—A LYRICAL LEPROSY BY WHICH HE CONTAMINATES SOULS SUBDUES THEM CRUSHES OR EXALTS THEM. . . . ONLY THE SKEPTICS (OR IDLERS OR AESTHETES) ESCAPE BECAUSE THEY PROPOSE NOTHING BECAUSE THEY—HUMANITY’S TRUE BENEFACTORS—UNDERMINE FANATICISM’S PURPOSES ANALYZE ITS FRENZY. I FEEL SAFER WITH A PYRRHO THAN WITH A SAINT PAUL FOR A JESTING WISDOM IS GENTLER THAN AN UNBRIDLED SANCTITY. IN THE FERVENT MIND YOU ALWAYS FIND THE CAMOUFLAGED BEAST OF PREY; NO PROTECTION IS ADEQUATE AGAINST THE CLAWS OF A PROPHET. . . . ONCE HE RAISES HIS VOICE WHETHER IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN OF THE CITY OR SOME OTHER EXCUSE AWAY WITH YOU: SATYR OF YOUR SOLITUDE HE WILL NOT FORGIVE YOUR LIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HIS TRUTHS AND HIS TRANSPORTS; HE WANTS YOU TO SHARE HIS HYSTERIA HIS FULLNESS HE WANTS TO IMPOSE IT ON YOU AND THEREBY TO DISFIGURE YOU. A HUMAN BEING POSSESSED BY A BELIEF AND NOT EAGER TO PASS IT ON TO OTHERS IS A PHENOMENON ALIEN TO THE EARTH WHERE OUR MANIA FOR SALVATION MAKES LIFE UNBREATHABLE. LOOK AROUND YOU: EVERYWHERE SPECTERS PREACHING; EACH INSTITUTION TRANSLATES A MISSION; CITY HALLS HAVE THEIR ABSOLUTE EVEN AS THE TEMPLES—OFFICIALDOM WITH ITS RULES—A METAPHYSICS DESIGNED FOR MONKEYS. . . EVERYONE TRYING TO REMEDY EVERYONE’S LIFE: EVEN BEGGARS EVEN THE INCURABLE ASPIRE TO IT: THE SIDEWALKS AND HOSPITALS OF THE WORLD OVERFLOW WITH REFORMERS. THE LONGING TO BECOME A SOURCE OF EVENTS AFFECTS EACH MAN LIKE A MENTAL DISORDER OR A DESIRED MALEDICTION. SOCIETY—AN INFERNO OF SAVIORS! WHAT DIOGENES WAS LOOKING FOR WITH HIS LANTERN WAS AN INDIFFERENT MAN. . . .

IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR SOMEONE TALK SINCERELY ABOUT IDEALS ABOUT THE FUTURE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY TO HEAR HIM SAY “WE” WITH A CERTAIN INFLECTION OF ASSURANCE TO HEAR HIM INVOKE “OTHERS” AND REGARD HIMSELF AS THEIR INTERPRETER—-FOR ME TO CONSIDER HIM MY ENEMY. I SEE IN HIM A TYRANT MANQUÉ AN APPROXIMATE EXECUTIONER QUITE AS DETESTABLE AS THE FIRST-RATE TYRANTS THE FIRST-RATE EXECUTIONERS EVERY FAITH PRACTICES SOME FORM OF TERROR ALL THE MORE DREADFUL WHEN THE “PURE” ARE ITS AGENTS. WE MISTRUST THE SWINDLER THE TRICKSTER THE CON MAN; YET TO THEM WE CAN IMPUTE NONE OF HISTORY’S GREAT CONVULSIONS; BELIEVING IN NOTHING IT IS NOT THEY WHO RUMMAGE IN YOUR HEARTS OR YOUR ULTERIOR MOTIVES; THEY LEAVE YOU TO YOUR APATHY TO YOUR DESPAIR OR TO YOUR USELESSNESS; TO THEM HUMANITY OWES THE FEW MOMENTS OF PROSPERITY IT HAS KNOWN: IT IS THEY WHO SAVE THE PEOPLES WHOM FANATICS TORTURE AND “IDEALISTS” DESTROY. DOCTRINELESS THEY HAVE ONLY WHIMS AND INTERESTS ACCOMMODATING VICES A THOUSAND TIMES MORE ENDURABLE THAN THE RAVAGES PROVOKED BY PRINCIPLED DESPOTISM; FOR ALL OF LIFE’S EVILS COME FROM A “CONCEPTION OF LIFE.” AN ACCOMPLISHED POLITICIAN SHOULD SEARCH OUT THE ANCIENT SOPHISTS AND TAKE LESSONS IN ORATORY—AND IN CORRUPTION. . . .

WHEREAS THE FANATIC IS INCORRUPTIBLE: IF HE KILLS FOR AN IDEA HE CAN JUST AS WELL GET HIMSELF KILLED FOR ONE; IN EITHER CASE TYRANT OR MARTYR HE IS A MONSTER. NO HUMAN BEINGS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR A BELIEF: THE GREAT PERSECUTORS ARE RECRUITED AMONG THE MARTYRS NOT QUITE BEHEADED. FAR FROM DIMINISHING THE APPETITE FOR POWER SUFFERING EXASPERATES IT; HENCE THE MIND FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE SOCIETY OF A BRAGGART THAN IN THAT OF A MARTYR; AND NOTHING IS MORE REPUGNANT TO IT THAN THE SPECTACLE OF DYING FOR AN IDEA. . . . REVOLTED BY THE SUBLIME AND BY CARNAGE THE MIND DREAMS OF A PROVINCIAL ENNUI ON THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE OF A HISTORY WHOSE STAGNATION WOULD BE SO GROT THAT DOUBT WOULD TAKE ON THE LINEAMENTS OF AN EVENT AND HOPE A CALAMITY. . .

THE ANTI-PROPHET
IN EVERY MAN SLEEPS A PROPHET AND WHEN HE WAKES THERE IS A LITTLE MORE EVIL IN THE WORLD. . . .

THE COMPULSION TO PREACH IS SO ROOTED IN US THAT IT EMERGES FROM DEPTHS UNKNOWN TO THE INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION. EACH OF US AWAITS HIS MOMENT IN ORDER TO PROPOSE SOMETHING—ANYTHING. HE HAS A VOICE: THAT IS ENOUGH. IT COSTS US DEAR TO BE NEITHER DEAF NOR DUMB. . . .

FROM SNOBS TO SCAVENGERS ALL EXPEND THEIR CRIMINAL GENEROSITY ALL HAND OUT FORMULAS FOR HAPPINESS ALL TRY TO GIVE DIRECTIONS: LIFE IN COMMON THEREBY BECOMES INTOLERABLE AND LIFE WITH ONESELF STILL MORE SO; IF YOU FAIL TO MEDDLE IN OTHER PEOPLE’S BUSINESS YOU ARE SO UNEASY ABOUT YOUR OWN THAT YOU CONVERT YOUR “SELF” INTO A RELIGION OR APOSTLE IN REVERSE YOU DENY IT ALTOGETHER; WE ARE VICTIMS OF THE UNIVERSAL GAME. . . .

THE ABUNDANCE OF SOLUTIONS TO THE ASPECTS OF EXISTENCE IS EQUALED ONLY BY THEIR FUTILITY. HISTORY: A FACTORY OF IDEALS . . . LUNATIC MYTHOLOGY FRENZY OF HORDES AND ©F SOLITARIES . . . REFUSAL TO LOOK REALITY IN THE FACE MORTAL THIRST FOR FICTIONS. . . .

THE SOURCE OF OUR ACTIONS RESIDES IN AN UNCONSCIOUS PROPENSITY TO REGARD OURSELVES AS THE CENTER THE CAUSE AND THE CONCLUSION OF TIME. OUR REFLEXES AND OUR PRIDE TRANSFORM INTO A PLANET THE PARCEL OF FLESH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WE ARE. IF WE HAD THE RIGHT SENSE OF OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD IF TO COMPARE WERE INSEPARABLE FROM TO LIVE THE REVELATION OF OUR INFINITESIMAL PRESENCE WOULD CRUSH US. BUT TO LIVE IS TO BLIND OURSELVES TO OUR OWN DIMENSIONS. . . .

AND IF ALL OUR ACTIONS—FROM BREATHING TO THE FOUNDING OF EMPIRES OR METAPHYSICAL SYSTEMS—DERIVE FROM AN ILLUSION AS TO OUR IMPORTANCE THE SAME IS TRUE A FORTIORI OF THE PROPHETIC INSTINCT. WHO WITH THE EXACT VISION OF HIS NULLITY WOULD TRY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND TO TURN HIMSELF INTO A SAVIOR?

NOSTALGIA FOR A WORLD WITHOUT “IDEALS” FOR AN AGONY WITHOUT DOCTRINE FOR AN ETERNITY WITHOUT LIFE . . . PARADISE. . . . BUT WE COULD NOT EXIST ONE SECOND WITHOUT DECEIVING OURSELVES: THE PROPHET IN EACH OF US IS JUST THE SEED OF MADNESS WHICH MAKES US FLOURISH IN OUR VOID.

THE IDEALLY LUCID HENCE IDEALLY NORMAL MAN SHOULD HAVE NO RECOURSE BEYOND THE NOTHING THAT IS IN HIM. . . . I CAN IMAGINE HIM SAYING: “TORN FROM THE GOAL FROM ALL GOALS I RETAIN OF MY DESIRES AND MY DISPLEASURES ONLY THEIR FORMULAS. HAVING RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO CONCLUDE I HAVE OVERCOME THE MIND AS I HAVE OVERCOME LIFE ITSELF BY THE HORROR OF LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER TO IT. THE SPECTACLE OF MAN—WHAT AN EMETIC! LOVE—A DUEL OF SALIVAS. .. . ALL THE FEELINGS MILK THEIR ABSOLUTE FROM THE MISERY OF THE GLANDS. NOBILITY IS ONLY IN THE NEGATION OF EXISTENCE IN A SMILE THAT SURVEYS ANNIHILATED LANDSCAPES. ONCE I HAD A 'SELF; NOW I AM NO MORE THAN AN OBJECT .. . I GORGE MYSELF ON ALL THE DRUGS OF SOLITUDE; THOSE OF THE WORLD WERE TOO WEAK TO MAKE ME FORGET IT. HAVING KILLED THE PROPHET IN ME HOW COULD I STILL HAVE A PLACE AMONG MEN?”

IN THE GRAVEYARD OF DEFINITIONS
ARE WE ENTITLED TO IMAGINE A MIND EXCLAIMING: “EVERYTHING IS PURPOSELESS TO ME NOW FOR I HAVE GIVEN THE DEFINITIONS OF ALL THINGS"? AND IF WE COULD IMAGINE SUCH A MIND HOW LOCATE IT WITHIN DURATION?

WHAT SURROUNDS US WE ENDURE BETTER FOR GIVING IT A NAME—AND MOVING ON. BUT TO EMBRACE A THING BY A DEFINITION HOWEVER ARBITRARY—AND ALL THE MORE SERIOUS THE MORE ARBITRARY IT IS SINCE THE SOUL THEN OVERTAKES KNOWLEDGE—IS TO REJECT THAT THING TO RENDER IT INSIPID AND SUPERFLUOUS TO ANNIHILATE IT. THE IDLE EMPTY MIND—WHICH JOINS THE WORLD ONLY BY THE GRACE OF SLEEP—CAN PRACTICE ONLY BY EXTENDING THE NAME OF THINGS BY EMPTYING DIEM AND SUBSTITUTING FORMULAS FOR THEM. THEN IT MANEUVERS OVER THEIR DEBRIS; NO MORE SENSATIONS; NOTHING BUT MEMORIES. UNDER EACH FORMULA LIES A CORPSE: BEING AND OBJECT ALIKE DIE UNDER THE PRETEXT THEY HAVE OCCASIONED.

THIS IS THE MIND’S FRIVOLOUS FUNEREAL DEBAUCH. AND THIS MIND HAS SQUANDERED ITSELF IN WHAT IT HAS NAMED AND CIRCUMSCRIBED. INFATUATED BY SYLLABLES IT LOATHED THE MYSTERY OF HEAVY SILENCES AND TURNED THEM LIGHT AND PURE; AND IT TOO HAS BECOME LIGHT AND PURE INDEED LIGHTENED AND PURIFIED OF EVERYTHING. THE VICE OF DEFINING HAS MADE IT A GRACIOUS ASSASSIN AND A DISCREET VICTIM.

THIS IS HOW THE STAIN THE SOUL SPREAD OVER THE MIND HAS BEEN REMOVED-—THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED IT THAT IT WAS ALIVE.

CIVILIZATION AND FRIVOLITY
HOW COULD WE BEAR THE WEIGHT AND SHEER DEPTH OF WORKS AND MASTERPIECES IF TO THEIR TEXTURE CERTAIN IMPERTINENT AND DELICIOUS MINDS HAD NOT ADDED THE FRINGES OF SUBTLE SCORN AND READY IRONIES? AND HOW COULD WE ENDURE THE CODES THE CUSTOMS THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE HEART WHICH INERTIA AND PROPRIETY HAVE SUPERIMPOSED UPON THE FUTILE AND INTELLIGENT VICES IF IT WERE NOT FOR THOSE PLAYFUL BEINGS WHOSE REFINEMENT PUTS THEM AT ONCE AT THE APEX AND IN THE MARGIN OF SOCIETY?

WE MUST BE THANKFUL TO THE CIVILIZATIONS WHICH HAVE NOT TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF SERIOUSNESS WHICH HAVE PLAYED WITH VALUES AND TAKEN THEIR PLEASURE IN BEGETTING AND DESTROYING THEM. WHO KNOWS OUTSIDE OF THE GREEK AND FRENCH CIVILIZATIONS A MORE LUCIDLY FACETIOUS PROOF OF THE ELEGANT NOTHINGNESS OF THINGS? THE AGE OF ALCIBIADES AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN FRANCE ARE TWO SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. WHILE IT IS ONLY AT THEIR FINAL STAGES AT THE DISSOLUTION OF A WHOLE SYSTEM OF BEHAVIOR AND BELIEF THAT THE OTHER CIVILIZATIONS COULD ENJOY THAT LIVELY EXERCISE WHICH LENDS A FLAVOR OF FUTILITY TO LIFE IT WAS IN FULL RIPENESS IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR POWERS AND OF THE FUTURE THAT THESE TWO EPOCHS KNEW THE TEDIUM HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING AND PERMEABLE TO EVERYTHING. WHAT BETTER SYMBOL THAN THAT OF MADAME DU DEFFAND OLD BLIND AND PERSPICACIOUS WHO EVEN WHILE EXECRATING LIFE NONETHELESS RELISHED TO THE LAST ITS EVERY AMENITY OF GALL?

NO ONE ACHIEVES FRIVOLITY STRAIGHT OFF. IT IS A PRIVILEGE AND AN ART; IT IS THE PURSUIT OF THE SUPERFICIAL BY THOSE WHO HAVING DISCERNED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANY CERTITUDE HAVE CONCEIVED A DISGUST FOR SUCH THINGS; IT IS THE ESCAPE FAR FROM ONE ABYSS OR ANOTHER WHICH BEING BY NATURE BOTTOMLESS CAN LEAD NOWHERE.

THERE REMAIN NONETHELESS THE APPEARANCES; WHY NOT RAISE THEM TO THE LEVEL OF A STYLE? THEREBY WE DEFINE EVERY INTELLIGENT PERIOD. THEREBY WE FIND MORE PRESTIGE IN EXPRESSION THAN IN THE SOUL WHICH SUPPORTS IT IN GRACE THAN IN INTUITION; EMOTION ITSELF BECOMES POLITE. THE HUMAN BEING DELIVERED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY PARTIALITY FOR ELEGANCE IS A MONSTER; HE FINDS ONLY DARK REGIONS THERE WHERE TERROR AND NEGATION IMMINENT PROWL TO KNOW BY ALL ONE’S VITALITY THAT ONE WILL DIE AND TO BE UNABLE TO CONCEAL IT IS AN ACT OF BARBARISM. ANY SINCERE PHILOSOPHY RENOUNCES THE CLAIMS OF CIVILIZATION WHOSE FUNCTION CONSISTS IN SIFTING OUR SECRETS AND DISGUISING THEM AS RECHERCHÉ EFFECTS. THUS FRIVOLITY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTIDOTE TO THE DISEASE OF BEING WHAT ONE IS: BY FRIVOLITY WE ABUSE THE WORLD AND DISSIMULATE THE IMPROPRIETY OF OUR DEPTHS. WITHOUT ITS ARTIFICES HOW COULD WE HELP BLUSHING TO HAVE A SOUL? OUR SKIN-DEEP SOLITUDES WHAT AN INFERNO FOR OTHER PEOPLE! BUT IT IS ALWAYS FOR THEM AND SOMETIMES FOR OURSELVES THAT WE INVENT OUR APPEARANCES. . . .

DISSOLVING INTO GOD
THE MIND SCRUPULOUS OF ITS DISTINCT ESSENCE IS THREATENED AT EVERY TURN BY THE THINGS IT REJECTS. OFTEN ABANDONING ATTENTION—THE GREATEST OF ITS PRIVILEGES—SUCH A MIND YIELDS TO THE TEMPTATIONS IT HAS SOUGHT TO ESCAPE OR BECOMES THE PREY OF IMPURE MYSTERIES . . . WHO HAS NOT KNOWN THOSE FEARS THOSE DIZZY SPELLS THOSE DELIRIUMS WHICH BRING US BACK TO THE BEAST BACK TO THE LAST PROBLEMS? OUR KNEES TREMBLE BUT DO NOT BEND; OUR HANDS CLUTCH WITHOUT CLASPING EACH OTHER; OUR EYES LOOK UP AND SEE NOTHING. . . . WE PRESERVE THAT VERTICAL PRIDE WHICH STRENGTHENS ITS COURAGE; THAT HORROR OF GESTURES WHICH SAVES US FROM SPECTACLE; AND THE SUCCOR OF EYELIDS TO VEIL AN ABSURDLY INEFFABLE GAZE. OUR COLLAPSE IS IMMINENT BUT NOT INEVITABLE; THE ACCIDENT IS ODD BUT SCARCELY NEW; ALREADY A SMILE DAWNS ON THE HORIZON OF OUR TERRORS . . . WE SHALL NOT TOPPLE INTO PRAYER. . . FOR AFTER ALL HE MUST NOT TRIUMPH; IT IS UP TO OUR IRONY TO COMPROMISE HIS CAPITAL LETTER; UP TO OUR HEART TO DISSOLVE THE SHUDDERS HE DISPENSES.

IF SUCH A BEING REALLY EXISTED IF OUR WEAKNESSES VANQUISHED OUR RESOLUTIONS AND OUR DEPTHS OUR DELIBERATIONS THEN WHY GO ON THINKING SINCE OUR DIFFICULTIES WOULD BE SETTLED OUR QUESTIONS SUSPENDED AND OUR FEARS ALLAYED? WHICH WOULD BE TOO EASY. EVERY ABSOLUTE—PERSONAL OR ABSTRACT—IS A WAY OF AVOIDING THE PROBLEMS AND NOT ONLY THE PROBLEMS BUT ALSO THEIR ROOT WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A PANIC OF THE SENSES.

GOD: A PERPENDICULAR FALL UPON OUR FEAR A SALVATION LANDING LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AMID OUR INVESTIGATIONS WHICH NO HOPE DECEIVES THE IMMEDIATE ANNIHILATION OF OUR UNCONSOLED AND DETERMINEDLY INCONSCIABLE PRIDE A SIDETRACKING OF THE INDIVIDUAL THE SOUL ON THE DOLE FOR LACK OF ANXIETY. . .

WHAT GREATER RENUNCIATION THAN FAITH? TRUE WITHOUT IT WE ARE COMMITTED TO AN INFINITY OF DEAD ENDS BUT EVEN WHEN WE KNOW THAT NOTHING LEADS ANYWHERE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ONLY A BY-PRODUCT OF OUR GLOOM WHY SHOULD WE SACRIFICE THIS PLEASURE OF TOTTERING AND OF SPLITTING OUR SKULLS AGAINST HEAVEN AND EARTH?

THE SOLUTIONS OFFERED BY OUR ANCESTRAL COWARDICE ARE THE WORST DESERTIONS OF OUR DUTY TO INTELLECTUAL DECENCY. TO BE FOOLED TO LIVE AND DIE DUPED IS CERTAINLY WHAT MEN DO BUT THERE EXISTS A DIGNITY WHICH KEEPS US FROM DISAPPEARING INTO GOD AND WHICH TRANSFORMS ALL OUR MOMENTS INTO PRAYERS WE SHALL NEVER OFFER.

VARIATIONS ON DEATH
I. IT IS BECAUSE IT RESTS ON NOTHING BECAUSE IT LACKS EVEN THE SHADOW OF AN ARGUMENT THAT WE PERSEVERE IN LIFE. DEATH IS TOO EXACT; IT HAS ALL THE REASONS ON ITS SIDE. MYSTERIOUS FOR OUR INSTINCTS IT TAKES SHAPE TO OUR REFLECTION LIMPID WITHOUT GLAMOR AND WITHOUT THE FALSE LURES OF THE UNKNOWN.

BY DINT OF ACCUMULATING NON-MYSTERIES AND MONOPOLIZING NON-MEANINGS LIFE INSPIRES MORE DREAD THAN DEATH: IT IS LIFE WHICH IS THE GREAT UNKNOWN.

WHERE CAN SO MUCH VOID AND INCOMPREHENSIBILITY LEAD? WE CLING TO THE DAYS BECAUSE THE DESIRE TO DIE IS TOO LOGICAL HENCE INEFFECTIVE. IF LIFE HAD A SINGLE ARGUMENT IN ITS FAVOR—DISTINCT INDISPUTABLE—IT WOULD ANNIHILATE ITSELF; INSTINCTS AND PREJUDICES COLLAPSE AT THE CONTACT OF RIGOR. EVERYTHING THAT BREATHES FEEDS ON THE UNVERIFIABLE; A DOSE OF LOGIC WOULD BE DEADLY TO EXISTENCE—THAT EFFORT TOWARD THE SENSELESS. . . . GIVE LIFE A SPECIFIC GOAL AND IT IMMEDIATELY LOSES ITS ATTRACTION. THE INEXACTITUDE OF ITS ENDS MAKES LIFE SUPERIOR TO DEATH; ONE TOUCH OF PRECISION WOULD DEGRADE IT TO THE TRIVIALITY OF THE TOMBS. FOR A POSITIVE SCIENCE OF THE MEANING OF LIFE WOULD DEPOPULATE THE EARTH IN A DAY AND NOT EVEN A MADMAN COULD SUCCEED IN REVIVING THE FRUITFUL IMPROBABILITY OF DESIRE.

II. MEN CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE MOST WHIMSICAL CRITERIA: ACCORDING TO THEIR HUMORS THEIR INCLINATIONS THEIR DREAMS OR THEIR GLANDS. WE CHANGE IDEAS LIKE NECKTIES; FOR EVERY IDEA EVERY CRITERION COMES FROM OUTSIDE FROM THE CONFIGURATIONS AND ACCIDENTS OF TIME. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM OURSELVES THAT IS OURSELVES AN INVISIBLE BUT INWARDLY VERIFIABLE REALITY AN UNWONTED AND ETERNAL PRESENCE THAT WE CAN CONCEIVE AT ANY MOMENT AND THAT WE NEVER DARE ADMIT WHICH IS REAL ONLY BEFORE ITS CONSUMMATION: DEATH THE TRUE CRITERION. . . . AND IT IS DEATH THE MOST INTIMATE DIMENSION OF ALL THE LIVING WHICH SEPARATES HUMANITY INTO TWO ORDERS SO IRREDUCIBLE SO REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER THAT THERE IS MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THAN BETWEEN A VULTURE AND A MOLE A STAR AND A STARFISH. THE ABYSS OF TWO INCOMMUNICABLE WORLDS OPENS BETWEEN THE MAN WHO HAS THE SENTIMENT OF DEATH AND THE MAN WHO DOES NOT; YET BOTH DIE; BUT ONE IS UNAWARE OF HIS DEATH THE OTHER KNOWS- ONE DIES ONLY FOR A MOMENT THE OTHER UNCEASINGLY. . . . THEIR COMMON CONDITION LOCATES THEM PRECISELY AT EACH OTHER’S ANTIPODES AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES AND WITHIN ONE AND THE SAME DEFINITION; IRRECONCILABLE THEY SUFFER THE SAME FATE. . . . ONE LIVES AS IF HE WERE ETERNAL; THE OTHER THINKS CONTINUALLY OF HIS ETERNITY AND DENIES IT IN EACH THOUGHT.

NOTHING CAN CHANGE OUR LIFE BUT THE GRADUAL INSINUATION WITHIN US OF THE FORCES WHICH ANNIHILATE IT. NO NEW PRINCIPLE COMES TO IT FROM THE SURPRISES OF OUR GROWTH NOR FROM THE EFFLORESCENCE OF OUR GIFTS; THEY ARE MERELY NATURAL TO IT. AND NOTHING NATURAL CAN MAKE US ANYTHING BUT OURSELVES.

EVERYTHING WHICH PREFIGURES DEATH ADDS A QUALITY OF NOVELTY TO LIFE MODIFIES AND AMPLIFIES IT. HEALTH PRESERVES LIFE AS SUCH IN A STERILE IDENTITY; WHILE DISEASE IS AN ACTIVITY THE MOST INTENSE A MAN CAN INDULGE IN A FRENETIC AND . . . STATIONARY MOVEMENT THE RICHEST EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY WITHOUT GESTURE THE HOSTILE AND IMPASSIONED EXPECTATION OF AN IRREPARABLE LIGHTNING BOLT.

III. AGAINST THE OBSESSION WITH DEATH BOTH THE SUBTERFUGES OF HOPE AND THE ARGUMENTS OF REASON LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS: THEIR INSIGNIFICANCE MERELY WHETS THE APPETITE TO DIE. IN ORDER TO TRIUMPH OVER THIS APPETITE THERE IS BUT ONE “METHOD": TO LIVE IT TO THE END TO SUBMIT TO ALL ITS PLEASURES ALL ITS PANGS TO DO NOTHING TO ELUDE IT. AN OBSESSION EXPERIENCED TO THE POINT OF SATIETY IS ANNIHILATED IN ITS OWN EXCESSES. BY DWELLING ON THE INFINITY OF DEATH THOUGHT MANAGES TO USE IT UP TO INSPIRE DISGUST FOR IT IN US DISGUST THAT NEGATIVE SUPERFLUITY WHICH SPARES NOTHING AND WHICH BEFORE COMPROMISING AND DIMINISHING THE PRESTIGE OF DEATH SHOWS US THE INANITY OF LIFE.

THE MAN WHO HAS NOT GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO THE PLEASURES OF ANGUISH WHO HAS NOT SAVORED IN HIS MIND THE DANGERS OF HIS OWN EXTINCTION NOR RELISHED SUCH CRUEL AND SWEET ANNIHILATIONS WILL NEVER BE CURED OF THE OBSESSION WITH DEATH: HE WILL BE TORMENTED BY IT FOR HE WILL HAVE RESISTED IT; WHILE THE MAN WHO HABITUATED TO A DISCIPLINE OF HORROR AND MEDITATING UPON HIS OWN CARRION HAS DELIBERATELY REDUCED HIMSELF TO ASHES—THAT MAN WILL LOOK TOWARD DEATH’S PAST AND HE HIMSELF WILL BE MERELY A RESURRECTED BEING WHO CAN NO LONGER LIVE. HIS “METHOD” WILL HAVE CURED HIM OF BOTH LIFE AND DEATH.

EVERY CRUCIAL EXPERIENCE IS FATAL: THE LAYERS OF EXISTENCE LACK DENSITY; THE MAN WHO EXPLORES THEM ARCHAEOLOGIST OF THE HEART OF BEING FINDS HIMSELF AT THE END OF HIS RESEARCHES CONFRONTING EMPTY DEPTHS. HE WILL VAINLY REGRET THE PANOPLY OF APPEARANCES.

HENCE THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES SO-CALLED REVELATIONS OF THE ULTIMATE SECRETS HAVE BEQUEATHED US NOTHING BY WAY OF KNOWLEDGE. THE INITIATES WERE DOUBTLESS OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENCE; YET IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT NOT A SINGLE CHATTERBOX WAS AMONG THEIR NUMBER; WHAT IS MORE CONTRARY TO HUMAN NATURE THAN SUCH STUBBORNNESS IN SECRECY? THE FACT IS THAT THERE WERE NO SECRETS; THERE WERE RITES THERE WERE SHUDDERS. ONCE THE VEILS HAD FALLEN WHAT COULD THEY DISCOVER BUT INSIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES? THE ONLY INITIATION IS TO NOTHINGNESS—AND TO THE MOCKERY OF BEING ALIVE . . . AND I DREAM OF AN ELEUSIS OF DISABUSED HEARTS OF A LUCID MYSTERY WITHOUT GODS AND WITHOUT THE VEHEMENCES OF ILLUSION.

IN THE MARGIN OF MOMENTS
IT IS OUR INCAPACITY TO WEEP WHICH SUSTAINS OUR TASTE FOR THINGS WHICH MAKES THEM EXIST AT ALL: IT KEEPS US FROM EXHAUSTING THEIR SAVOR AND FROM TURNING AWAY. WHEN ON SO MANY BRINKS AND BYROADS OUR EYES REFUSED TO DROWN IN THEMSELVES THEIR DRYNESS PRESERVED THE OBJECT WHICH AMAZED THEM. OUR TEARS SQUANDER NATURE AS OUR TERRORS DO GOD . . . BUT IN THE END THEY SQUANDER OURSELVES. FOR WE EXIST ONLY BY THE REFUSAL TO GIVE FREE REIN TO OUR SUPREME DESIRES: THE THINGS WHICH ENTER THE SPHERE OF OUR ADMIRATION OR OUR DESPAIR REMAIN THERE ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE NEITHER SACRIFICED THEM NOR BLESSED THEM WITH OUR LIQUID FAREWELLS.

SO IT IS THAT AFTER EACH NIGHT FACING A NEW DAY THE IMPOSSIBLE NECESSITY OF DEALING WITH IT FILLS US WITH DREAD; EXILED IN LIGHT AS IF THE WORLD HAD JUST STARTED INVENTING THE SUN WE FLEE FROM TEARS—JUST ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WASH US OUT OF TIME.

DISLOCATION OF TIME
THE MOMENTS FOLLOW EACH OTHER; NOTHING LENDS THEM THE ILLUSION OF A CONTENT OR THE APPEARANCE OF A MEANING; THEY PASS; THEIR COURSE IS NOT OURS; WE CONTEMPLATE THAT PASSAGE PRISONERS OF A STUPID PERCEPTION. THE HEART’S VOID CONFRONTING TIME’S: TWO MIRRORS REFLECTING EACH OTHER’S ABSENCE ONE AND THE SAME IMAGE OF NULLITY. .. . AS THOUGH BY THE EFFECT OF A DREAMY IDIOCY EVERYTHING IS LEVELED: NO MORE PEAKS NO MORE PLUNGES. . . . WHERE TO LOCATE THE POETRY OF LIES THE GOAD OF AN ENIGMA?

THE MAN WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF ENNUI IS STILL IN THE WORLD’S CHILDHOOD WHEN THE AGES WERE WAITING TO BE BORN; HE REMAINS CLOSED OFF FROM THAT TIRED TIME WHICH OUTLIVES ITSELF WHICH LAUGHS AT ITS DIMENSIONS AND SUCCUMBS ON THE THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN . . . FUTURE DRAGGING ALONG MATTER SUDDENLY RAISED TO A LYRICISM OF NEGATION. ENNUI IS THE ECHO IN US OF TIME TEARING ITSELF APART . . . THE REVELATION OF THE VOID THE DRYING UP OF THAT DELIRIUM WHICH SUSTAINS—OR INVENTS—LIFE. . . .

CREATOR OF VALUES MAN IS THE DELIRIOUS CREATURE PAR EXCELLENCE VICTIM OF THE BELIEF THAT SOMETHING EXISTS WHEREAS HE NEED MERELY HOLD HIS BREATH: EVERYTHING STOPS; SUSPEND HIS EMOTIONS: NOTHING STIRS; SUPPRESS HIS WHIMS: THE WORLD TURNS TO ASHES. REALITY IS A CREATION OF OUR EXCESSES OF OUR DISPROPORTIONS AND DERANGEMENTS. REIN IN YOUR PALPITATIONS AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS SLOWS DOWN; WITHOUT OUR ARDORS SPACE IS ICE. TIME ITSELF PASSES ONLY BECAUSE OUR DESIRES BEGET THAT DECORATIVE UNIVERSE WHICH A JOT OF LUCIDITY WOULD LAY BARE. ONE TOUCH OF CLEARSIGHTEDNESS REDUCES US TO OUR PRIMAL STATE: NAKEDNESS; A SUSPICION OF IRONY STRIPS US OF THAT TRUMPERY HOPE WHICH LET US DUPE OURSELVES AND DEVISE ILLUSION: EVERY CONTRARY PATH LEADS OUTSIDE OF LIFE. ENNUI IS MERELY THE BEGINNING OF SUCH AN ITINERARY. . . . IT MAKES US FIND TIME LONG TOO LONG—UNSUITED TO SHOW US AN END. DETACHED FROM EVERY OBJECT HAVING NOTHING EXTERNAL TO ASSIMILATE WE DESTROY OURSELVES IN SLOW MOTION SINCE THE FUTURE HAS STOPPED OFFERING US A RAISON D'ÊTRE.

ENNUI SHOWS US AN ETERNITY WHICH IS NOT THE TRANSCENDENCE OF TIME BUT ITS WRECK; IT IS THE INFINITY OF SOULS THAT HAVE ROTTED FOR LACK OF SUPERSTITIONS A BANAL ABSOLUTE WHERE NOTHING ANY LONGER KEEPS THINGS FROM TURNING IN CIRCLES IN SEARCH OF THEIR OWN FALL.

LIFE CREATES ITSELF IN DELIRIUM AND IS UNDONE IN ENNUI.

(THE MAN SUFFERING FROM A CHARACTERIZED SICKNESS IS NOT ENTITLED TO COMPLAIN: HE HAS AN OCCUPATION. THE GREAT SUFFERERS ARE NEVER BORED: DISEASE FILLS THEM THE WAY REMORSE FEEDS THE GREAT CRIMINALS. FOR ANY INTENSE SUFFERING PRODUCES A SIMULACRUM OF PLENITUDE AND PROPOSES A TERRIBLE REALITY TO CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IT CANNOT ELUDE; WHILE SUFFERING WITHOUT SUBSTANCE IN THAT TEMPORAL MOURNING OF ENNUI AFFORDS CONSCIOUSNESS NOTHING THAT FORCES IT TO FRUITFUL ACTION. HOW TO CURE AN UNLOCALIZED AND SUPREMELY IMPALPABLE DISEASE WHICH INFECTS THE BODY WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE UPON IT WHICH INSINUATES ITSELF INTO THE SOUL WITHOUT MARKING IT BY ANY SIGN? ENNUI IS LIKE A SICKNESS WE HAVE SURVIVED BUT ONE WHICH HAS ABSORBED OUR POSSIBILITIES OUR RESERVES OF ATTENTION AND HAS LEFT US IMPOTENT TO FILL THE VOID WHICH FOLLOWS UPON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR PANGS AND THE FADING OF OUR TORMENTS. HELL IS A HAVEN NEXT TO THIS DISPLACEMENT IN TIME THIS EMPTY AND PROSTRATE LANGUOR IN WHICH NOTHING STOPS US BUT THE SPECTACLE OF THE UNIVERSE DECAYING BEFORE OUR EYES.

WHAT THERAPEUTICS TO INVOKE AGAINST A DISEASE WE NO LONGER REMEMBER AND WHOSE AFTERMATH ENCROACHES UPON OUR DAYS? HOW INVENT A REMEDY FOR EXISTENCE HOW CONCLUDE THIS ENDLESS CURE? AND HOW RECOVER FROM YOUR OWN BIRTH?

ENNUI THAT INCURABLE CONVALESCENCE . . .)

MAGNIFICENT FUTILITY
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GREEK SKEPTICS AND THE ROMAN EMPERORS OF THE DECADENCE ALL MINDS SEEM ENSLAVED BY A MUNICIPAL VOCATION. ONLY THESE TWO GROUPS ARE EMANCIPATED THE FORMER BY DOUBT THE LATTER BY DEMENTIA FROM THE INSIPID OBSESSION OF BEING USEFUL. HAVING PROMOTED THE ARBITRARY TO THE RANK OF DRILL OR DELIRIUM DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY WERE PHILOSOPHERS OR DISABUSED SCIONS OF THE OLD CONQUERORS THEY WERE ATTACHED TO NOTHING: IN THIS REGARD THEY SUGGEST THE SAINTS. BUT WHILE THE SAINTS WERE NEVER TO COLLAPSE THESE OTHERS FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE MERCY OF THEIR OWN GAME MASTERS AND VICTIMS OF THEIR WHIMS—TRUE SOLITARIES SINCE THEIR SOLITUDE WAS STERILE. NO ONE HAS FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE AND THEY THEMSELVES PROPOSED NO SUCH THING; HENCE THEY COMMUNICATED WITH THEIR “KIND” ONLY BY IRONY AND TERROR. . .

TO BE THE DISSOLVENT OF A PHILOSOPHY OR OF AN EMPIRE: WHAT PRIDE COULD BE MORE MELANCHOLY AND MORE MAJESTIC? TO KILL ON THE ONE HAND TRUTH AND GREATNESS ON THE OTHER MANIAS WHICH NOURISH THE MIND AND THE CITY; TO UNDERMINE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FACADES PROTECTING THE THINKER’S PRIDE AND THE CITIZEN’S; TO FLEX TO THE POINT OF FRACTURING THE SPRINGS OF THEIR IMPULSE TO CONCEIVE AND TO WILL; TO DISCREDIT BY THE SUBTLETIES OF SARCASM AND TORTURE BOTH TRADITIONAL ABSTRACTIONS AND HONORABLE CUSTOMS—WHAT DELICATE AND BRUTAL EFFERVESCENCE! NOTHING BEGUILES WHERE THE GODS DIE BEFORE OUR EYES. IN ROME WHERE THEY WERE REPLACED IMPORTED WHERE THEY COULD BE SEEN TO WITHER WHAT PLEASURE TO INVOKE GHOSTS WITH YET THE ONE FEAR THAT THIS SUBLIME VERSATILITY MIGHT CAPITULATE TO THE ASSAULT OF SOME SEVERE AND IMPURE DEITY . . . WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED.

IT IS NOT EASY TO DESTROY AN IDOL: IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME AS IS REQUIRED TO PROMOTE AND TO WORSHIP ONE. FOR IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ANNIHILATE ITS MATERIAL SYMBOL WHICH IS EASY; BUT ITS ROOTS IN THE SOUL. HOW TURN YOUR EYES TOWARD THE TWILIGHT AGES—WHEN THE PAST WAS LIQUIDATED UNDER A SCRUTINY WHICH ONLY THE VOID COULD DAZZLE—WITHOUT BEING MOVED BY THAT GREAT ART WHICH IS THE DEATH OF A CIVILIZATION?

. . . AND SO I DREAM OF HAVING BEEN ONE OF THOSE SLAVES COMING FROM AN IMPROBABLE COUNTRY BARBAROUS AND BROODING TO LANGUISH IN THE AGONY OF ROME MY VAGUE DESOLATION EMBELLISHED BY GREEK SOPHISTRIES. IN THE VACANT EYES OF THE STATUES IN THE IDOLS SHRUNKEN BY SAGGING SUPERSTITIONS I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT MY ANCESTORS MY YOKES AND MY REGRETS. ESPOUSING THE MELANCHOLY OF THE ANCIENT SYMBOLS I SHOULD HAVE LIBERATED MYSELF; I SHOULD HAVE SHARED THE DIGNITY OF THE ABANDONED GODS DEFENDING THEM AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS CROSSES AGAINST THE INVASION OF SERVANTS AND MARTYRS AND MY NIGHTS WOULD HAVE SOUGHT THEIR REST IN THE DELIRIUM AND DEBAUCHERY OF THE CAESARS. EXPERT IN DISILLUSIONS RIDDLING THE NEW FERVORS WITH ALL THE ARROWS OF A DISSOLUTE WISDOM—AMONG THE COURTESANS IN SKEPTICAL BROTHELS OR CIRCUSES WITH THEIR SUMPTUOUS CRUELTIES I SHOULD HAVE SWELLED MY REASONINGS WITH VICE AND WITH BLOOD DILATING LOGIC TO DIMENSIONS IT HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TO THE DIMENSIONS OF WORLDS THAT DIE.

EXEGESIS OF FAILURE
EACH OF US IS BORN WITH A SHARE OF PURITY PREDESTINED TO BE CORRUPTED BY OUR COMMERCE WITH MANKIND BY THAT SIN AGAINST SOLITUDE. FOR EACH OF US WILL DO ANYTHING IN ORDER NOT TO BE DOOMED TO HIMSELF. OUR KIND IS NOT A FATALITY BUT THE TEMPTATION TO FAIL. INCAPABLE OF KEEPING OUR HANDS CLEAN AND OUR HEARTS UNDILUTED WE SOIL OURSELVES UPON CONTACT WITH STRANGE SWEATS WE WALLOW—CRAVING FOR DISGUST AND FERVENT FOR PESTILENCE—IN THE UNANIMOUS MUD. AND WHEN WE DREAM OF SEAS CHANGED INTO HOLY WATER IT IS TOO LATE TO DIVE INTO THEM AND OUR ADVANCED STATE OF CORRUPTION KEEPS US FROM DROWNING THERE: THE WORLD HAS INFESTED OUR SOLITUDE; UPON US THE TRACES OF OTHERS BECOME INDELIBLE.

IN THE GAMUT OF CREATURES ONLY MAN INSPIRES A SUSTAINED DISGUST. THE REPUGNANCE WHICH AN ANIMAL BEGETS IS PROVISIONAL; IT NEVER RIPENS IN THOUGHT WHEREAS OUR KIND OBSESSES OUR REFLECTIONS INFILTRATES THE MECHANISM OF OUR DETACHMENT FROM THE WORLD IN ORDER TO CONFIRM US IN OUR SYSTEM OF REFUSAL AND NON-ADHERENCE. AFTER EACH CONVERSATION WHOSE REFINEMENT ALONE IS ENOUGH TO INDICATE THE LEVEL OF A CIVILIZATION WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO REGRET THE SAHARA AND NOT TO ENVY THE PLANTS OR THE ENDLESS MONOLOGUES OF ZOOLOGY?

IF WITH EACH WORD WE WIN A VICTORY OVER NOTHINGNESS IT IS ONLY THE BETTER TO ENDURE ITS REIGN. WE DIE IN PROPORTION TO THE WORDS WHICH WE FLING AROUND US . . . THOSE WHO SPEAK HAVE NO SECRETS. AND WE ALL SPEAK. WE BETRAY OURSELVES WE EXHIBIT OUR HEART; EXECUTIONER OF THE UNSPEAKABLE EACH OF US LABORS TO DESTROY ALL THE MYSTERIES BEGINNING WITH OUR OWN. AND IF WE MEET OTHERS IT IS TO DEGRADE OURSELVES TOGETHER IN A RACE TO THE VOID WHETHER IN THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS SCHEMES OR CONFESSIONS. CURIOSITY HAS PROVOKED NOT ONLY THE FIRST FALL BUT THE COUNTLESS ONES OF EVERY DAY OF OUR LIVES. LIFE IS ONLY THAT IMPATIENCE TO FALL TO FAIL TO PROSTITUTE THE SOUL’S VIRGINAL SOLITUDES BY DIALOGUE AGELESS AND EVERYDAY NEGATION OF PARADISE. MAN SHOULD LISTEN ONLY TO HIMSELF IN THE ENDLESS ECSTASY OF THE INTRANSMISSIBLE WORD SHOULD CREATE WORDS FOR HIS OWN SILENCES AND ASSENTS AUDIBLE ONLY TO HIS REGRETS. BUT HE IS THE CHATTERBOX OF THE UNIVERSE; HE SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF OTHERS; HIS SELF LOVES THE PLURAL. AND ANYONE WHO SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF OTHERS IS ALWAYS AN IMPOSTOR. POLITICIANS REFORMERS AND ALL WHO RELY ON A COLLECTIVE PRETEXT ARE CHEATS. THERE IS ONLY THE ARTIST WHOSE LIE IS NOT A TOTAL ONE FOR HE INVENTS ONLY HIMSELF. OUTSIDE OF THE SURRENDER TO THE INCOMMUNICABLE THE SUSPENSION AMID OUR MUTE AND UNCONSOLED ANXIETIES LIFE IS MERELY A FRACAS ON AN UNMAPPED TERRAIN AND THE UNIVERSE A GEOMETRY STRICKEN WITH EPILEPSY.

(THE IMPLICIT PLURAL OF “ONE” AND THE AVOWED PLURAL OF “WE” CONSTITUTE THE COMFORTABLE REFUGE OF FALSE EXISTENCE. ONLY THE POET TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR “I” HE ALONE SPEAKS IN HIS OWN NAME HE ALONE IS ENTITLED TO DO SO. POETRY IS BASTARDIZED WHEN IT BECOMES PERMEABLE TO PROPHECY OR TO DOCTRINE: “MISSION” SMOTHERS MUSIC IDEA SHACKLES INSPIRATION. SHELLY’S “GENEROUS” ASPECT CRIPPLES MOST OF HIS WORK; SHAKESPEARE BY A STROKE OF LUCK NEVER “SERVED” ANYTHING.

THE VICTORY OF NON-AUTHENTICITY IS FULFILLED IN PHILOSOPHICAL ACTIVITY THAT COMPLACENCE IN “ONE” AND IN PROPHETIC ACTIVITY [WHETHER RELIGIOUS MORAL OR POLITICAL] THAT APOTHEOSIS OF “WE.” DEFINITION IS THE LIE OF THE ABSTRACT MIND; INSPIRED FORMULA THE LIE OF THE MILITANT ONE; A DEFINITION IS ALWAYS THE CORNERSTONE OF A TEMPLE; A FORMULA INESCAPABLY MUSTERS THE FAITHFUL. THUS ALL TEACHINGS BEGIN.

HOW THEN FAIL TO TURN TO POETRY? IT HAS LIKE LIFE THE EXCUSE OF PROVING NOTHING.)

COALITION AGAINST DEATH
HOW IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE’S LIVES WHEN OUR OWN SEEMS SCARCELY CONCEIVABLE? WE MEET SOMEONE WE SEE HIM PLUNGED INTO AN IMPENETRABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE WORLD IN A MASS OF DESIRES AND CONVICTIONS SUPERIMPOSED ON REALITY LIKE A MORBID STRUCTURE. HAVING MADE A SYSTEM OF MISTAKES FOR HIMSELF HE SUFFERS FOR REASONS WHOSE NULLITY ALARMS THE MIND AND SURRENDERS HIMSELF TO VALUES WHOSE ABSURDITY LEAPS TO THE EYE. WHAT ARE HIS UNDERTAKINGS BUT TRIFLES AND IS THE FEVERISH SYMMETRY OF HIS CONCERNS ANY BETTER BUILT THAN AN ARCHITECTURE OF TWADDLE? TO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER THE ABSOLUTE OF EACH LIFE LOOKS INTERCHANGEABLE AND EVERY FATE HOWEVER FIXED IN ITS ESSENCE ARBITRARY. WHEN OUR CONVICTIONS SEEM THE FRUIT OF A FRIVOLOUS LUNACY HOW TOLERATE OTHER PEOPLE’S PASSIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR OWN MULTIPLICATION IN EACH DAY’S UTOPIA? BY WHAT NECESSITY DOES THIS MAN SHUT HIMSELF UP IN A PARTICULAR WORLD OF PREDILECTIONS AND THAT MAN IN ANOTHER?

WHEN WE ENDURE THE CONFIDENCES OF A FRIEND OR A STRANGER THE REVELATION OF HIS SECRETS FILLS US WITH ASTONISHMENT. ARE WE TO RELATE HIS TORMENTS TO DRAMA OR TO FARCE? THIS DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE GOOD WILL OR THE EXASPERATIONS OF OUR LASSITUDE. EACH FATE BEING NO MORE THAN A REFRAIN FLUTTERING AROUND A FEW BLOODSTAINS IT IS UP TO OUR MOODS TO SEE IN THE DISPOSITION OF SUCH SUFFERINGS A SUPERFLUOUS AND PIQUANT ORDER OR A PRETEXT FOR PITY.

SINCE IT IS DIFFICULT TO APPROVE THE REASONS PEOPLE INVOKE EACH TIME WE LEAVE ONE OF OUR FELLOW MEN THE QUESTION WHICH COMES TO MIND IS INVARIABLY THE SAME: HOW DOES HE KEEP FROM KILLING HIMSELF? FOR NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL THAN TO IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE’S SUICIDE. WHEN WE HAVE GLIMPSED BY AN OVERWHELMING AND READILY RENEWABLE INTUITION ANYONE’S OWN USELESSNESS IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT EVERYONE HAS NOT DONE THE SAME. TO DO AWAY WITH ONESELF SEEMS SUCH A CLEAR AND SIMPLE ACTION! WHY IS IT SO RARE WHY DOES EVERYONE AVOID IT? BECAUSE IF REASON DISAVOWS THE APPETITE FOR LIFE THE NOTHING WHICH EXTENDS OUR ACTS IS NONETHELESS OF A POWER SUPERIOR TO ALL ABSOLUTES; IT EXPLAINS THE TACIT COALITION OF MORTALS AGAINST DEATH; IT IS NOT ONLY THE SYMBOL OF EXISTENCE BUT EXISTENCE ITSELF; IT IS EVERYTHING. AND THIS NOTHING THIS EVERYTHING CANNOT GIVE LIFE A MEANING BUT IT NONETHELESS MAKES LIFE PERSEVERE IN WHAT IT IS: A STATE OF NON-SUICIDE.

SUPREMACY OF THE ADJECTIVE
SINCE THERE CAN BE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF WAYS TO FACE THE ULTIMATE PROBLEMS THE MIND IS LIMITED IN ITS EXPANSION BY THAT NATURAL BOUNDARY WHICH IS THE ESSENTIAL BY THAT IMPOSSIBILITY OF INDEFINITELY MULTIPLYING THE CAPITAL DIFFICULTIES: HISTORY IS SOLELY CONCERNED WITH CHANGING THE ASPECT OF A SUM OF QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS. WHAT THE MIND INVENTS IS MERELY A SERIES OF NEW QUALIFICATIONS; IT REBAPTIZES THE ELEMENTS OR SEEKS IN ITS LEXICONS LESS ERODED EPITHETS FOR THE ONE IMMUTABLE PAIN. WE HAVE ALWAYS SUFFERED BUT OUR SUFFERING HAS BEEN EITHER “SUBLIME” OR “LEGITIMATE” OR “ABSURD” ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL VIEWS WHICH THE PHILOSOPHIC MOMENT MAINTAINED. MISERY CONSTITUTES THE TEXTURE OF ALL THAT BREATHES; BUT ITS MODALITIES HAVE CHANGED COURSE; THEY HAVE COMPOSED THAT SERIES OF IRREDUCIBLE APPEARANCES WHICH LEAD EACH OF US TO BELIEVE HE IS THE FIRST TO HAVE SUFFERED SO. THE PRIDE OF SUCH UNIQUENESS INCITES US TO CHERISH OUR OWN PAIN AND TO ENDURE IT. IN A WORLD OF SUFFERINGS EACH OF THEM IS A SOLIPSIST IN RELATION TO ALL THE REST. MISERY’S ORIGINALITY IS DUE TO THE VERBAL QUALITY WHICH ISOLATES IT IN THE SUM OF WORDS AND SENSATIONS. . . .

THE QUALIFIERS CHANGE: THIS CHANGE IS CALLED INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS. SUPPRESS THEM ALL AND WHAT WOULD REMAIN OF CIVILIZATION? THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND STUPIDITY RESIDES IN THE MANIPULATION OF THE ADJECTIVE WHOSE USE WITHOUT DIVERSITY CONSTITUTES BANALITY. GOD HIMSELF LIVES ONLY BY THE ADJECTIVES WE ADD TO HIM; WHEREBY THE RAISON D'ETRE OF THEOLOGY. HENCE MAN BY MODULATING THE MONOTONY OF HIS MISERY EVER VARIOUSLY JUSTIFIES HIMSELF TO THE MIND ONLY BY THE IMPASSIONED SEARCH FOR A NEW ADJECTIVE.

(AND YET THIS SEARCH IS PITIABLE. THE POVERTY OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS THE MIND’S POVERTY IS MANIFEST IN THE INDIGENCE OF WORDS IN THEIR EXHAUSTION AND THEIR DEGRADATION: THE ATTRIBUTES BY WHICH WE DETERMINE THINGS AND SENSATIONS FINALLY LIE BEFORE US LIKE SO MUCH VERBAL CARRION. AND WE GLANCE REGRETFULLY AT THE TIME WHEN THEY GAVE OFF NO MORE THAN AN ODOR OF CONFINEMENT. ALL ALEXANDRIANISM BEGINS WITH THE NEED TO VENTILATE WORDS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR BLEMISHES BY A LIVELY REFINEMENT; BUT IT ENDS IN A LASSITUDE IN WHICH MIND AND WORD ARE MINGLED AND DECOMPOSE. [IDEALLY THE FINAL STAGE OF A LITERATURE AND OF A CIVILIZATION: IMAGINE A VALÉRY WITH THE SOUL OF A NERO. . . .]

SO LONG AS OUR UNTRIED SENSES AND OUR NAIVE HEART RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES AND DELIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE OF QUALIFICATIONS THEY FLOURISH WITH THE AID AND AT THE RISK OF THE ADJECTIVE WHICH ONCE DISSECTED PROVES INADEQUATE DEFICIENT. WE SAY OF SPACE OF TIME AND OF SUFFERING THAT THEY ARE INFINITE; BUT INFINITE HAS NO MORE BEARING THAN BEAUTIFUL SUBLIME HARMONIOUS UGLY. . . . SUPPOSE WE FORCE OURSELVES TO SEE TO THE BOTTOM OF WORDS? WE SEE NOTHING—EACH OF THEM DETACHED FROM THE EXPANSIVE AND FERTILE SOUL BEING NULL AND VOID. THE POWER OF THE INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS BY PROJECTING A CERTAIN LUSTER UPON THEM BY POLISHING THEM AND MAKING THEM GLITTER; THIS POWER ERECTED INTO A SYSTEM IS CALLED CULTURE—PYROTECHNICS AGAINST A NIGHT SKY OF NOTHINGNESS.)

THE DEVIL REASSURED
WHY IS GOD SO DULL SO FEEBLE SO INADEQUATELY PICTURESQUE? WHY DOES HE LACK INTEREST VIGOR ACTUALITY AND RESEMBLE US SO LITTLE? IS THERE ANY IMAGE LESS ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND MORE GRATUITOUSLY REMOTE? HOW COULD WE HAVE PROJECTED INTO HIM LIGHTS SO DIM AND POWERS SO UNSTEADY? WHERE HAVE OUR ENERGEIS LEAKED AWAY TO WHERE HAVE OUR DESIRES RUN OUT? WHO THEN HAS ABSORBED OUR OVERFLOW OF VITAL INSOLENCE?

SHALL WE TURN TO THE DEVIL? BUT WE CANNOT ADDRESS OUR PRAYERS TO HIM: TO WORSHIP HIM WOULD BE TO PRAY IRRESPECTIVELY TO PRAY TO OURSELVES. WE DO NOT PRAY TO WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE: THE EXACT IS NOT AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP. WE HAVE PLACED IN OUR DOUBLE ALL OUR ATTRIBUTES AND IN ORDER TO AFFORD HIM A SEMBLANCE OF SOLEMNITY WE HAVE DRESSED HIM IN BLACK: OUR VICES AND OUR VIRTUES IN MOURNING. BY ENDOWING HIM WITH WICKEDNESS AND PERSEVERANCE OUR DOMINANT QUALITIES WE HAVE EXHAUSTED OURSELVES TO MAKE HIM AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE; OUR POWERS HAVE BEEN USED UP IN CREATING HIS IMAGE IN MAKING HIM AGILE FRISKY INTELLIGENT IRONIC AND ABOVE ALL PETTY. THE RESERVES OF ENERGY WE STILL HAD LEFT TO PRODUCE GOD WERE REDUCED TO NOTHING. THEN WE RESORTED TO THE IMAGINATION AND TO WHAT LITTLE BLOOD WE HAD LEFT: GOD COULD BE ONLY THE FRUIT OF OUR ANEMIA: A TOTTERING AND RACHITIC IMAGE. HE IS MILD GOOD SUBLIME JUST. BUT WHO RECOGNIZES HIMSELF IN THAT MIXTURE REDOLENT OF ROSE WATER RELEGATED TO TRANSCENDENCE? A BEING WITHOUT DUPLICITY LACKS DEPTH LACKS MYSTERY; HE HIDES NOTHING. ONLY IMPURITY IS A SIGN OF REALITY. AND IF THE SAINTS ARE NOT COMPLETELY STRIPPED OF INTEREST IT IS BECAUSE THEIR SUBLIMITY IS TINGED WITH THE NOVELISTIC THEIR ETERNITY LENDS ITSELF TO BIOGRAPHY; THEIR LIVES INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE LEFT THE WORLD FOR A GENRE CAPABLE OF CAPTIVATING US FROM TIME TO TIME. . . .

BECAUSE HE OVERFLOWS WITH LIFE THE DEVIL HAS NO ALTAR: MAN RECOGNIZES HIMSELF TOO READILY IN HIM TO WORSHIP HIM; HE DETESTS HIM FOR GOOD REASON; HE REPUDIATES HIMSELF AND MAINTAINS THE INDIGENT ATTRIBUTES OF GOD. BUT THE DEVIL NEVER COMPLAINS AND NEVER ASPIRES TO FOUND A RELIGION: ARE WE NOT HERE TO SAFEGUARD HIM FROM INANITION AND OBLIVION?

PROMENADE AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE
WITHIN THE CIRCLE WHICH ENCLOSES HUMAN BEINGS IN A COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS AND HOPES THE MIND OPPOSED TO MIRAGES CLEARS A PATH FROM THE CENTER TOWARD THE PERIPHERY. IT CAN NO LONGER HEAR AT CLOSE RANGE THE HUM OF HUMANITY; IT WANTS TO CONSIDER FROM AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE THE ACCURSED SYMMETRY WHICH LINKS MEN TOGETHER. IT SEES MARTYRS EVERYWHERE: SOME SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR VISIBLE NEEDS OTHERS FOR INESTIMABLE NECESSITIES ALL READY TO BURY THEIR NAMES UNDER A CERTITUDE; AND SINCE NOT ALL OF THEM CAN SUCCEED THE MAJORITY EXPIATE BY BANALITY THE OVERFLOW OF BLOOD THEY HAVE DREAMED OF . . . THEIR LIVES CONSIST OF AN ENORMOUS FREEDOM TO DIE WHICH THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF: INEXPRESSIVE HOLOCAUST OF HISTORY THE BONEYARD SWALLOWS THEM UP.

BUT THE ENTHUSIAST OF SEPARATIONS SEEKING PATHS UNHAUNTED BY THE HORDES WITHDRAWS TO THE EXTREME MARGIN AND FOLLOWS THE RIM OF THE CIRCLE WHICH HE CANNOT CROSS SO LONG AS HE IS SUBJECT TO THE BODY; YET CONSCIOUSNESS SOARS FARTHER QUITE PURE IN AN ENNUI WITHOUT BEINGS OR OBJECTS. NO LONGER SUFFERING SUPERIOR TO THE EXCUSES WHICH INVITE DYING CONSCIOUSNESS FORGETS THE MAN WHO SUPPORTS IT. MORE UNREAL THAN A STAR GLIMPSED IN SOME HALLUCINATION IT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF A SIDEREAL PIROUETTE—WHILE ON LIFE’S CIRCUMFERENCE THE SOUL PROMENADES MEETING ONLY ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITSELF AND ITS IMPOTENCE TO ANSWER THE CALL OF THE VOID.

THE SUNDAYS OF LIFE
IF SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WERE EXTENDED FOR MONTHS WHERE WOULD HUMANITY GET TO LIBERATED FROM SWEAT FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST CURSE? THE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT CRIME WOULD BECOME THE SOLE DIVERSION THAT DEBAUCHERY WOULD SEEM CANDOR SHOUTING MELODY AND JEERS TENDERNESS. THE SENSATION OF TIME’S IMMENSITY WOULD MAKE EACH SECOND INTO AN INTOLERABLE TORMENT A SUBLIME FIRING SQUAD. IN HEARTS IMBUED WITH POETRY WOULD APPEAR A BLASÉ CANNIBALISM AND A HYENA’S MELANCHOLY; BUTCHERS AND EXECUTIONERS WOULD DIE OUT—OF LETHARGY; CHURCHES AND BROTHELS WOULD SPLIT WITH SIGHS. THE UNIVERSE TRANSFORMED INTO A SUNDAY AFTERNOON . . . IT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF ENNUI AND THE END OF THE UNIVERSE. . . . TAKE AWAY THE CURSE HANGING OVER HISTORY AND IT IMMEDIATELY VANISHES LIKE EXISTENCE ITSELF IN ABSOLUTE VACANCY EXPOSING ITS FICTION. LABOR BUILDS ON NOTHINGNESS CREATES AND CONSOLIDATES MYTHS; ELEMENTARY INTOXICATION IT EXCITES AND MAINTAINS THE BELIEF IN “REALITY"; BUT CONTEMPLATION OF PURE EXISTENCE CONTEMPLATION INDEPENDENT OF ACTIONS AND OBJECTS ASSIMILATES ONLY WHAT IS NOT. . . .

THE IDLE APPREHEND MORE THINGS ARE DEEPER THAN THE INDUSTRIOUS: NO TASK LIMITS THEIR HORIZON; BORN INTO AN ETERNAL SUNDAY THEY WATCH-—AND WATCH THEMSELVES WATCHING. SLOTH IS A SOMATIC SKEPTICISM THE WAY THE FLESH DOUBTS. IN A WORLD OF INACTION THE IDLE WOULD BE THE ONLY ONES NOT TO BE MURDERERS. BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO HUMANITY AND SWEAT NOT BEING THEIR STRONG POINT THEY LIVE WITHOUT SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE AND OF SIN. DOING NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL THEY DISDAIN—SPECTATORS OF THE HUMAN CONVULSION—THE WEEKS OF TIME THE EFFORTS WHICH ASPHYXIATE CONSCIOUSNESS. WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO FEAR FROM A LIMITLESS EXTENSION OF CERTAIN AFTERNOONS EXCEPT THE REGRET OF HAVING SUPPORTED A CRUDELY ELEMENTARY OBVIOUSNESS? THEN EXASPERATION IN THE TRUTH MIGHT INDUCE THEM TO IMITATE THE OTHERS AND TO INDULGE IN THE DEGRADING TEMPTATION OF TASKS. THIS IS THE DANGER WHICH THREATENS SLOTH THAT MIRACULOUS RESIDUE OF PARADISE.

(LOVE’S ONE FUNCTION IS TO HELP US ENDURE THOSE CRUEL AND INCOMMENSURABLE SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WHICH TORMENT US FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK—AND FOR ETERNITY.

WITHOUT THE ALLUREMENT OF THE ANCESTRAL SPASM WE SHOULD REQUIRE A THOUSAND EYES FOR HIDDEN TEARS OR ELSE NAILS TO BITE MILE-LONG NAILS. . . . HOW ELSE KILL THIS TIME WHICH NO LONGER PASSES? ON THOSE INTERMINABLE SUNDAYS THE DISEASE OF BEING IS UTTERLY PLAIN. SOMETIMES WE MANAGE TO FORGET OURSELVES IN SOMETHING; BUT HOW FORGET OURSELVES IN THE WORLD ITSELF? THIS IMPOSSIBILITY IS THE DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE. THE MAN WHO IS AFFLICTED BY IT WILL NEVER BE CURED EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED ALTOGETHER. ONLY HIS HEART SHOULD CHANGE BUT IT IS UNCHANGEABLE; HENCE FOR HIM TO EXIST HAS ONLY ONE MEANING: TO DIVE INTO SUFFERING—UNTIL THE EXERCISE OF A DAY-BY-DAY NIRVANIZATION RAISES HIM TO THE PERCEPTION OF UNREALITY. . . .)

RESIGNATION
IT WAS IN A CLINIC WAITING ROOM: AN OLD WOMAN WAS TELLING ME ABOUT HER DISEASES. . . . THE CONTROVERSIES OF MEN THE HURRICANES OF HISTORY—IN HER EYES TRIFLES: HER SICKNESS ALONE PREVAILED OVER TIME AND SPACE. “1 CAN’T EAT I CAN’T SLEEP I’M AFRAID THERE MUST BE SOME PUS HERE . . .” SHE BEGAN CARESSING HER JAW WITH MORE INTEREST THAN IF THE FATE OF THE WORLD DEPENDED ON IT. AT FIRST THIS EXCESS OF SELF-CONCERN ON THE PART OF A DECREPIT CRONE LEFT ME TORN BETWEEN DREAD AND DISGUST; THEN I LEFT THE CLINIC BEFORE IT WAS MY TURN DETERMINED TO RENOUNCE MY DISCOMFORTS FOREVER. . . .

“FIFTY-NINE SECONDS OUT OF EACH OF MY MINUTES” I REFLECTED AS I WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS “WERE DEDICATED TO SUFFERING OR TO . . . THE IDEA OF SUFFERING. IF ONLY I HAD A STONE’S VOCATION! A HEART: ORIGIN OF EVERY TORMENT. . . I ASPIRE TO THE OBJECT TO THE BLESSING OF MATTER AND OPACITY. THE ZIGZAGGING OF A GNAT SEEMS TO ME AN APOCALYPTIC ENTERPRISE. IT IS A SIN TO GET OUTSIDE YOURSELF. . . THE WIND—AIR’S INSANITY! MUSIC THE MADNESS OF SILENCE! BY CAPITULATING TO LIFE THIS WORLD HAS BETRAYED NOTHINGNESS. . . . I RESIGN FROM MOVEMENT AND FROM MY DREAMS. ABSENCE! YOU SHALL BE MY SOLE GLORY. . . . LET “DESIRE” BE FOREVER STRICKEN FROM THE DICTIONARY AND FROM THE SOUL! I RETREAT BEFORE THE DIZZYING FARCE OF TOMORROWS. AND IF I STILL CLING TO A FEW HOPES I HAVE LOST FOREVER THE FACULTY OF HOPING™

THE INDIRECT ANIMAL
WHAT A DOWNFALL WHEN YOU BEAR IN MIND BY SOME RADICAL OBSESSION THAT MAN EXISTS THAT HE IS WHAT HE IS—AND THAT HE CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. BUT WHAT HE IS A THOUSAND DEFINITIONS EXPOSE AND NONE COMPELS RECOGNITION: THE MORE ARBITRARY THEY ARE THE MORE VALID THEY SEEM. THE AIRIEST ABSURDITY AND THE WEIGHTIEST BANALITY ARE EQUALLY APPROPRIATE. THE INFINITY OF HIS ATTRIBUTES COMPOSES THE MOST IMPRECISE BEING WE CAN CONCEIVE. WHEREAS THE ANIMALS PROCEED DIRECTLY TO THEIR GOAL MAN LOSES HIMSELF IN DETOURS; HE IS THE INDIRECT ANIMAL PAR EXCELLENCE. HIS IMPROBABLE REFLEXES—FROM WHOSE SLACKENING CONSCIOUSNESS DERIVES—TRANSFORM MM INTO A CONVALESCENT ASPIRING TO DISEASE. NOTHING IN HIM IS HEALTHY EXCEPT THE FACT OF HAVING BEEN SO. WHETHER HE IS AN ANGEL THAT HAS LOST HIS WINGS OR AN APE THAT HAS LOST HIS HAIR HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE ANONYMITY OF CREATURES ONLY BY THE ECLIPSES OF HIS HEALTH. HIS POORLY CONSTITUTED BLOOD HAS ALLOWED THE INFILTRATION OF UNCERTAINTIES APPROXIMATIONS PROBLEMS; HIS WAVERING VITALITY THE INTRUSION OF QUESTION MARKS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS. HOW DEFINE THE VIRUS WHICH ERODING HIS SOMNOLENCE HAS STUNNED HIM WITH INSOMNIA AMONG THE UNIVERSAL SIESTA? WHAT WORM HAS BURROWED INTO HIS REPOSE WHAT PRIMAL AGENT OF KNOWLEDGE HAS FORCED HIM TO THE BACKWARDNESS OF ACTIONS THE ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRES? WHO HAS INTRODUCED THE FIRST LANGUOR INTO HIS FEROCITY? EMERGING FROM THE THRONG OF THE OTHER LIVING CREATURES HE HAS CREATED A SUBTLER CONFUSION FOR HIMSELF; HE HAS SCRUPULOUSLY EXPLOITED THE ILLS OF A LIFE WRESTED FROM ITSELF OUT OF ALL HE HAS UNDERTAKEN TO BE HEALED OF HIMSELF A STRANGER DISEASE HAS BEEN CONSTITUTED: HIS “CIVILIZATION” IS MERELY THE EFFORT TO FIND REMEDIES FOR AN INCURABLE—AND COVETED—STATE. THE MIND WILTS AT THE APPROACH OF HEALTH: MAN IS AN INVALID—OR HE IS NOTHING. WHEN HAVING THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING HE THINKS OF HIMSELF—FOR HE MANAGES THIS ONLY BY THE DETOUR OF THE UNIVERSE AS IF HE WERE THE LAST PROBLEM HE PROPOSES TO HIMSELF—HE REMAINS ASTONISHED CONFUSED EMBARRASSED. BUT HE CONTINUES TO PREFER TO THE NATURE WHICH ETERNALLY CAPSIZES INTO HEALTH HIS OWN DEFEAT.

(SINCE ADAM MEN’S ENTIRE EFFORT HAS BEEN TO MODIFY MAN. THE AIMS OF REFORM AND OF PEDAGOGY ARTICULATED AT THE EXPENSE OF IRREDUCIBLE DATA DENATURE THOUGHT AND DISTORT ITS MOVEMENT. KNOWLEDGE HAS NO MORE DESPERATE ENEMY THAN THE EDUCATIVE INSTINCT AT ONCE OPTIMISTIC AND VIRULENT WHICH NO PHILOSOPHER CAN ESCAPE: HOW WOULD THEIR SYSTEMS BE UNSCATHED BY IT? OUTSIDE THE IRREMEDIABLE EVERYTHING IS FALSE; FALSE THIS CIVILIZATION WHICH SEEKS TO COMBAT IT FALSE THE TRUTHS WITH WHICH IT ARMS ITSELF.

EXCEPT FOR THE ANCIENT SKEPTICS AND THE FRENCH MORALISTS IT WOULD BE HARD TO CITE A SINGLE MIND WHOSE THEORIES SECRETLY OR EXPLICITLY DO NOT TEND TO MOLD MAN. BUT HE SUBSISTS UNCHANGED THOUGH HE HAS FOLLOWED THE PARADE OF NOBLE PRECEPTS PROPOSED TO HIS CURIOSITY OFFERED TO HIS ARDOR AND TO HIS UNCERTAINTY. WHEREAS ALL BEINGS HAVE THEIR PLACE IN NATURE MAN REMAINS A METAPHYSICALLY STRAYING CREATURE LOST IN LIFE A STRANGER TO THE CREATION. NO ONE HAS FOUND A VALID GOAL FOR HISTORY; BUT EVERYONE HAS PROPOSED ONE; AND IN THE PULLULATION OF GOALS SO DIVERGENT AND SO FANTASTIC THE NOTION OF FINALITY HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT AND VANISHES INTO A MOCKING CLAUSE OF THE MIND.

EACH OF US TAKES ON HIMSELF THAT UNIT OF DISASTER WHICH IS THE PHENOMENON MAN. AND THE ONLY MEANING TIME HAS IS TO MULTIPLY THESE UNITS ENDLESSLY TO ENLARGE THESE VERTICAL SUFFERINGS WHICH DEPEND UPON A NONENTITY OF MATTER UPON THE PRIDE OF A GIVEN NAME AND UPON A SOLITUDE WITHOUT APPEAL.)

THE KEY TO OUR ENDURANCE
THE MAN WHO MANAGED BY AN IMAGINATION OVERFLOWING WITH PITY TO RECORD ALL THE SUFFERINGS TO BE CONTEMPORARY WITH ALL THE PAIN AND ALL THE ANGUISH OF ANY GIVEN MOMENT—SUCH A MAN—SUPPOSING HE COULD EVER EXIST—WOULD BE A MONSTER OF LOVE AND THE GREATEST VICTIM IN THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN HEART. BUT IT IS FUTILE TO IMAGINE SUCH AN IMPOSSIBILITY. WE NEED MERELY PROCEED TO AN INVESTIGATION OF OURSELVES ONLY UNDERTAKE THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF OUR ALARMS. IF WE VENTURE INTO THE TORMENT OF THE DAYS IT IS BECAUSE NOTHING HALTS THIS MARCH EXCEPT OUR PANGS; THOSE OF OTHERS SEEM TO US EXPLICABLE AND CAPABLE OF BEING TRANSCENDED: WE BELIEVE THEY SUFFER BECAUSE THEY LACK SUFFICIENT WILL COURAGE OR LUCIDITY. EACH SUFFERING EXCEPT OURS SEEMS TO US LEGITIMATE OR ABSURDLY INTELLIGIBLE; OTHERWISE MOURNING WOULD BE THE UNIQUE CONSTANT IN THE VERSATILITY OF OUR SENTIMENTS. BUT WE WEAR ONLY THE MOURNING OF OURSELVES. IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND AND LOVE THE INFINITY OF AGONIES WHICH LANGUISH AROUND US ALL THE LIVES WHICH ARE HIDDEN DEATHS WE SHOULD REQUIRE AS MANY HEARTS AS THERE ARE SUFFERING BEINGS. AND IF WE HAD A MIRACULOUSLY PRESENT MEMORY WHICH SUSTAINED THE TOTALITY OF OUR PAST PAINS WE SHOULD SUCCUMB BENEATH SUCH A BURDEN. LIFE IS POSSIBLE ONLY BY THE DEFICIENCIES OF OUR IMAGINATION AND OUR MEMORY.

WE DERIVE OUR POWER FROM OUR FORGETTING AND FROM OUR INCAPACITY TO CONCEIVE OF THE PLURALITY OF SIMULTANEOUS FATES. NO ONE COULD SURVIVE THE INSTANTANEOUS COMPREHENSION OF UNIVERSAL GRIEF EACH HEART BEING STIRRED ONLY FOR A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF SUFFERINGS. THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE MATERIAL LIMITS TO OUR ENDURANCE; YET THE EXPANSION OF EACH PANG REACHES AND OCCASIONALLY EXCEEDS SUCH LIMITS: THIS IS TOO OFTEN THE SOURCE OF OUR RUIN. WHEREUPON THE IMPRESSION THAT EACH MISERY EACH DISAPPOINTMENT IS INFINITE. INDEED THEY ARE BUT ONLY FOR US FOR THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN HEART; AND IF THE LATTER HAD THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE ITSELF OUR ILLS WOULD BE MORE SPACIOUS STILL SINCE EVERY PAIN REPLACES THE WORLD AND FOR EACH UNHAPPINESS WE REQUIRE ANOTHER UNIVERSE. REASON VAINLY STRIVES TO SHOW US THE INFINITESIMAL PROPORTIONS OF OUR DISASTERS; IT FAILS CONFRONTED WITH OUR PENCHANT FOR COSMOGONIC PROLIFERATION. THUS TRUE MADNESS IS NEVER DUE TO CHANCE OR TO THE DISASTERS OF THE BRAIN BUT TO THE FALSE CONCEPTION OF SPACE THE HEART CREATES FOR ITSELF. . . .

ANNIHILATION BY DELIVERANCE
A DOCTRINE OF SALVATION HAS MEANING ONLY IF WE START FROM THE EQUATION “EXISTENCE EQUALS SUFFERING.” IT IS NEITHER A SUDDEN REALIZATION NOR A SERIES OF REASONINGS WHICH LEAD US TO THIS EQUATION BUT THE UNCONSCIOUS ELABORATION OF OUR EVERY MOMENT THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALL OUR EXPERIENCES MINUTE OR CRUCIAL. WHEN WE CARRY GERMS OF DISAPPOINTMENTS AND A KIND OF THIRST TO SEE THEM DEVELOP THE DESIRE THAT THE WORLD SHOULD UNDERMINE OUR HOPES AT EACH STEP MULTIPLIES THE VOLUPTUOUS VERIFICATIONS OF THE DISEASE. THE ARGUMENTS COME LATER; THE DOCTRINE IS CONSTRUCTED: THERE STILL REMAINS ONLY THE DANGER OF “WISDOM.” BUT SUPPOSE WE DO NOT WANT TO BE FREE OF SUFFERING NOR TO CONQUER OUR CONTRADICTIONS AND CONFLICTS—WHAT IF WE PREFER THE NUANCES OF THE INCOMPLETE AND AN AFFECTIVE DIALECTIC TO THE EVENNESS OF A SUBLIME IMPASSE? SALVATION ENDS EVERYTHING; AND ENDS US. WHO ONCE SAVED DARES STILL CALL HIMSELF ALIVE? WE REALLY LIVE ONLY BY THE REFUSAL TO BE DELIVERED FROM SUFFERING AND BY A KIND OF RELIGIOUS TEMPTATION OF IRRELIGIOSITY. SALVATION HAUNTS ONLY ASSASSINS AND SAINTS THOSE WHO HAVE KILLED OR TRANSCENDED THE CREATURE; THE REST WALLOW—DEAD DRUNK—IN IMPERFECTION. . . . THE MISTAKE OF EVERY DOCTRINE OF DELIVERANCE IS TO SUPPRESS POETRY CLIMATE OF THE INCOMPLETE. THE POET WOULD BETRAY HIMSELF IF HE ASPIRED TO BE SAVED: SALVATION IS THE DEATH OF SONG THE NEGATION OF ART AND OF THE MIND. HOW TO FEEL INTEGRAL WITH A CONCLUSION? WE CAN REFINE WE CAN FARM OUR SUFFERINGS BUT BY WHAT MEANS CAN WE FREE OURSELVES FROM THEM WITHOUT SUSPENDING OURSELVES? DOCILE TO MALEDICTION WE EXIST ONLY INSOFAR AS WE SUFFER. A SOUL ENLARGES AND PERISHES ONLY BY AS MUCH INSUPPORTABLE AS IT ASSUMES.

THE ABSTRACT VENOM
EVEN OUR VAGUE ILLS OUR DIFFUSE ANXIETIES DEGENERATING INTO PHYSIOLOGY SHOULD BY A CONVERSE IMPULSE BE RESTORED TO THE MANEUVERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE. IF WE RAISED ENNUI—TAUTOLOGICAL PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD THE DULL RIPPLE OF DURATION—TO THE DIGNITY OF A DEDUCTIVE ELEGY IF WE OFFERED IT THE TEMPTATION OF A GLAMOROUS STERILITY? WITHOUT RESORTING TO AN ORDER SUPERIOR TO THE SOUL THE SOUL COLLAPSES INTO THE FLESH—AND PHYSIOLOGY BECOMES THE LAST WORD OF OUR PHILOSOPHIC STUPORS. TO TRANSPOSE IMMEDIATE POISONS INTO INTELLECTUAL CURRENCY TO MAKE AN INSTRUMENT OUT OF OUR PALPABLE CORRUPTION OR ELSE TO MASK THE IMPURITY OF EVERY SENTIMENT AND SENSATION BY NORMS IS A PURSUIT OF ELEGANCE NECESSARY TO THE MIND NEXT TO WHICH THE SOUL—THAT PATHETIC HYENA—IS MERELY PROFOUND AND SINISTER. THE MIND IN ITSELF CAN BE ONLY SUPERFICIAL ITS NATURE BEING UNIQUELY CONCERNED WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF CONCEPTUAL EVENTS AND NOT WITH THEIR IMPLICATIONS IN THE SPHERES THEY SIGNIFY. OUR STATES INTEREST IT ONLY INSOFAR AS THEY ARE TRANSPOSABLE. THUS MELANCHOLIA EMANATES FROM OUR VISCERA AND JOINS THE COSMIC VOID; BUT THE MIND ADOPTS MELANCHOLIA ONLY FILTERED OF WHAT ATTACHES IT TO THE FRAGILITY OF THE SENSES; THE MIND INTERPRETS IT; REFINED MELANCHOLIA BECOMES POINT OF VIEW: DEPARTMENTAL MELANCHOLIA. THEORY LIES IN WAIT AND SEIZES UPON OUR VENOMS AND RENDERS THEM LESS NOXIOUS. IT IS A DEGRADATION FROM ABOVE THE MIND-AS-AMATEUR OF PURE INTOXICATIONS—SINCE IT IS THE ENEMY OF INTENSITIES.

THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISERY
EVERYTHING CONSPIRES ELEMENTS AND ACTIONS ALIKE TO HARM YOU. ARM YOURSELF IN DISDAIN ISOLATE YOURSELF IN A FORTRESS OF DISGUST DREAM OF SUPERHUMAN INDIFFERENCE? THE ECHOES OF TIME WOULD PERSECUTE YOU IN YOUR ULTIMATE ABSENCES. . . . WHEN NOTHING CAN KEEP YOU FROM BLEEDING IDEAS THEMSELVES TURN RED OR ENCROACH ON EACH OTHER LIKE TUMORS. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC IN OUR PHARMACIES AGAINST EXISTENCE; NOTHING BUT MINOR REMEDIES FOR BRAGGARTS. BUT WHERE IS THE ANTIDOTE FOR LUCID DESPAIR PERFECTLY ARTICULATED PROUD AND SURE? ALL OF US ARE MISERABLE BUT HOW MANY KNOW IT? THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISERY IS TOO SERIOUS A DISEASE TO FIGURE IN AN ARITHMETIC OF AGONIES OR IN THE CATALOGUES OF THE INCURABLE. IT BELITTLES THE PRESTIGE OF HELL AND CONVERTS THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES OF TIME INTO IDYLS. WHAT SIN HAVE YOU COMMITTED TO BE BORN WHAT CRIME TO EXIST? YOUR SUFFERING LIKE YOUR FATE IS WITHOUT MOTIVE. TO SUFFER TRULY TO SUFFER IS TO ACCEPT THE INVASION OF ILLS WITHOUT THE EXCUSE OF CAUSALITY AS A FAVOR OF DEMENTED NATURE AS A NEGATIVE MIRACLE. . . .

IN TIME’S SENTENCE MEN TAKE THEIR PLACE LIKE COMMAS WHILE IN ORDER TO END IT YOU HAVE IMMOBILIZED YOURSELF INTO A PERIOD.

INTERJECTIVE THOUGHT
THE IDEA OF INFINITY MUST HAVE BEEN BORN ON A DAY OF SLACKENING WHEN SOME VAGUE LANGUOR INFILTRATED INTO GEOMETRY LIKE THE FIRST ACT OF KNOWLEDGE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IN THE SILENCE OF REFLEXES A MACABRE SHUDDER ISOLATED THE PERCEPTION OF ITS OBJECT. HOW MANY DISGUSTS OR NOSTALGIAS HAVE WE HAD TO ACCUMULATE IN ORDER TO WAKEN AT THE END ALONE TRAGICALLY SUPERIOR TO THE EVIDENCE! A FORGOTTEN SIGH HAS MADE US TAKE A STEP OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE; A BANAL FATIGUE HAS ALIENATED US FROM A LANDSCAPE OR A PERSON; DIFFUSE MOANS HAVE SEPARATED US FROM SWEET OR TIMID INNOCENCES. THE SUM OF THESE ACCIDENTAL DISTANCES CONSTITUTES—LEDGER OF OUR DAYS AND NIGHTS—THE GAP WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE WORLD AND WHICH THE MIND STRIVES TO REDUCE AND TO RESTORE TO OUR FRAGILE PROPORTIONS. BUT THE CREATION OF EACH LASSITUDE MAKES ITSELF FELT: WHERE NOW TO SEEK FOR THE SUBSTANCE UNDER OUR STEPS?

AT FIRST IT IS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THINGS THAT WE THINK; THEN WHEN WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN ORDER TO LOSE OURSELVES IN THE REGRET FOR OUR ESCAPE. . . . AND SO OUR CONCEPTS ARE LINKED TOGETHER LIKE DISSIMULATED SIGHS EVERY REFLECTION REPLACES AN INTERJECTION A PLAINTIVE TONALITY SUBMERGES THE DIGNITY OF LOGIC. FUNEREAL HUES DIM OUR IDEAS HINTS OF THE GRAVEYARD ENCUMBER OUR PARAGRAPHS: A WHIFF OF MILDEW IN OUR PRECEPTS THE LAST DAY OF AUTUMN IN A TIMELESS CRYSTAL. . . . THE MIND IS DEFENSELESS AGAINST THE MIASMAS WHICH ASSAIL IT FOR THEY RISE FROM THE MOST CORRUPT PLACE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN FROM THE PLACE WHERE MADNESS LIES DOWN IN TENDERNESS CLOACA OF UTOPIAS AND DEN OF DREAMS: OUR SOUL AND EVEN THEN WHEN WE COULD CHANGE THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE OR FORESEE ITS WHIMS OUR SOUL WOULD SUBJUGATE US BY ITS MISERIES BY THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS RUIN. A SOUL WHICH IS NOT LOST? WHERE IS SUCH A THING SO THAT WE MAY DRAW UP THE INTERROGATION SO THAT SCIENCE SANCTITY AND COMEDY MAY SEIZE UPON IT!

APOTHEOSIS OF THE VAGUE
WE MIGHT APPREHEND THE ESSENCE OF NATIONS—EVEN MORE THAN THAT OF INDIVIDUALS—-BY THEIR WAY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE VAGUE. THE SPECIFICS IN WHICH THEY LIVE REVEAL ONLY THEIR TRANSITORY CHARACTER THEIR PERIPHERIES THEIR APPEARANCES.

WHAT A NATION CAN EXPRESS HAS ONLY A HISTORICAL VALUE: ITS SUCCESS IN BECOMING; BUT WHAT IT CANNOT EXPRESS ITS FAILURE IN THE ETERNAL IS THE UNPRODUCTIVE THIRST FOR ITSELF: ITS EFFORT TO EXHAUST ITSELF IN EXPRESSION BEING STRICKEN WITH IMPOTENCE IT FILLS THE GAP BY CERTAIN WORDS—ALLUSIONS TO THE UNSPEAKABLE. . . .

HOW MANY TIMES IN OUR PEREGRINATIONS OUTSIDE THE INTELLECT HAVE WE NOT RESTED OUR TROUBLES IN THE SHADE OF THOSE SEHNSUCHTS YEARNINGS SAUDADES THOSE SONOROUS FRUITS GROWN FOR OVERRIPE HEARTS!

LIFT THE VEIL FROM THESE WORDS: DO THEY CONCEAL THE SAME CONTENT? IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE SAME MEANING LIVES AND DIES IN THE VERBAL RAMIFICATIONS OF AN IDENTICAL STOCK? IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH DIVERSE PEOPLES EXPERIENCE NOSTALGIA IN THE SAME WAY?

THE MAN WHO STRUGGLES TO FIND THE FORMULA FOR THE DISEASE OF THE DISTANT BECOMES THE VICTIM OF A RICKETY ARCHITECTURE. TO GET BACK TO THE SOURCE OF THESE EXPRESSIONS OF THE VAGUE WE MUST MAKE AN AFFECTIVE REGRESSION TOWARD THEIR ESSENCE MUST DROWN IN THE INEFFABLE AND EMERGE FROM IT WITH OUR CONCEPTS IN TATTERS. ONCE OUR THEORETICAL ASSURANCE AND OUR PRIDE IN THE INTELLIGIBLE IS LOST WE CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FOR ITSELF THEN WE MANAGE TO REJOICE IN THE INEXPRESSIBLE TO SPEND OUR DAYS IN THE MARGIN OF THE COMPREHENSIBLE AND TO WALLOW IN THE SUBURBS OF THE SUBLIME. IN ORDER TO ESCAPE STERILITY WE MUST WEAR REASON’S MOURNING. . . .

TO LIVE IN EXPECTATION IN WHAT IS NOT YET IS TO ACCEPT THE STIMULATING DISEQUILIBRIUM IMPLIED BY THE VERY NOTION OF FUTURE. EVERY NOSTALGIA IS A TRANSCENDENCE OF THE PRESENT. EVEN IN THE FORM OF REGRET IT ASSUMES A DYNAMIC CHARACTER: WE WANT TO FORCE THE PAST WE WANT TO ACT RETROACTIVELY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE IRREVERSIBLE. LIFE HAS A CONTENT ONLY IN THE VIOLATION OF TIME. THE OBSESSION OF ELSEWHERE IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE MOMENT; AND THIS IMPOSSIBILITY IS NOSTALGIA ITSELF.

THAT THE FRENCH SHOULD HAVE REFUSED TO FEEL AND ABOVE ALL TO CULTIVATE THE IMPERFECTION OF THE INDEFINITE IS CERTAINLY SUGGESTIVE. IN A COLLECTIVE FORM THIS DISEASE DOES NOT EXIST IN FRANCE: WHAT THE FRENCH CALL CAFARD HAS NO METAPHYSICAL QUALITY AND ENNUI IS MANAGED ANGULARLY. THE FRENCH REPEL ALL COMPLACENCY TOWARD THE POSSIBLE; THEIR LANGUAGE ITSELF ELIMINATES ANY COMPLICITY WITH ITS DANGERS. IS THERE ANY OTHER NATION WHICH FINDS ITSELF MORE AT EASE IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH BEING CHEZ SOI HAS MORE MEANING AND MORE WEIGHT FOR WHICH IMMANENCE OFFERS MORE ATTRACTIONS?

IN ORDER TO DESIRE SOMETHING ELSE FUNDAMENTALLY WE MUST BE STRIPPED OF SPACE AND TIME WE MUST LIVE IN A MINIMUM OF RELATIONSHIP WITH A SITE A MOMENT. THE REASON THE HISTORY OF FRANCE OFFERS SO FEW DISCONTINUITIES IS THAT FIDELITY TO ITS ESSENCE WHICH FLATTERS OUR INCLINATION TO PERFECTION AND DISAPPOINTS THE CRAVING FOR THE INCOMPLETE WHICH A TRAGIC VISION IMPLIES. THE ONLY CONTAGIOUS THING IN FRANCE IS LUCIDITY THE HORROR OF BEING FOOLED OF BEING THE VICTIM OF ANYTHING. THIS IS WHY A FRENCHMAN ACCEPTS A RISK ONLY WHEN HE IS FULLY CONSCIOUS OF IT; HE WANTS TO BE FOOLED; HE BANDAGES HIS EYES; UNCONSCIOUS HEROISM RIGHTLY SEEMS TO HIM A LAPSE OF TASTE AN INELEGANT SACRIFICE. BUT LIFE’S BRUTAL AMBIGUITY REQUIRES THE TRIUMPH OF THE IMPULSE AND NOT OF THE WILL TO BE A CORPSE TO BE METAPHYSICALLY FOOLED.

IF THE FRENCH HAVE BURDENED NOSTALGIA WITH TOO MUCH CLARITY IF THEY HAVE STRIPPED IT OF A CERTAIN INTIMATE AND DANGEROUS GLAMOR SEHNSUCHT ON THE OTHER HAND EXHAUSTS WHATEVER IS INSOLUBLE ABOUT IT IN THE CONFLICTS OF THE GERMAN SOUL TORN BETWEEN HEIMAT AND INFINITY. 

HOW COULD IT FIND SATISFACTION? ON ONE SIDE THE LONGING TO BE PLUNGED INTO THE UNDIFFERENTIATION OF HEART AND HEARTH; ON THE OTHER TO KEEP ABSORBING SPACE IN AN UNSLAKED DESIRE. AND SINCE EXTENT OFFERS NO LIMITS AND SINCE WITH IT GROWS THE PENCHANT FOR NEW WANDERINGS THE GOAL RETREATS ACCORDING TO THE PROGRESS MADE. WHENCE THE EXOTIC TASTE THE PASSION FOR JOURNEYS THE DELECTATION IN LANDSCAPE AS LANDSCAPE THE LACK OF INNER FORM THE TORTUOUS DEPTH AT ONCE SEDUCTIVE AND DISHEARTENING. THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THE TENSION BETWEEN HEIMAT AND INFINITY: FOR IT IS TO BE ROOTED AND UPROOTED AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME AND TO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE FIRESIDE AND THE FAR-OFF . . . IMPERIALISM DEADLY CONSTANT IN ITS ULTIMATE ESSENCE—WHAT IS IT BUT THE POLITICAL AND VULGARLY CONCRETE TRANSLATION OF SEHNSUCHT?

WE CANNOT OVEREMPHASIZE THE HISTORICAL CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN INNER APPROXIMATIONS. NOW NOSTALGIA IS ONE OF THESE; IT KEEPS US FROM RESTING IN EXISTENCE OR IN THE ABSOLUTE; IT FORCES US TO DRIFT IN THE INDISTINCT TO LOSE OUR FOUNDATIONS TO LIVE UNCOVERED IN TIME.

TO BE TORN FROM THE EARTH EXILED IN DURATION CUT OFF FROM ONE’S IMMEDIATE ROOTS IS TO LONG FOR A REINTEGRATION IN THE ORIGINAL SOURCES DATING FROM BEFORE THE SEPARATION AND THE SEVERANCE. NOSTALGIA IS PRECISELY TO FEEL ETERNALLY DISTANT FROM CHEZ SOT\ AND OUTSIDE THE LUMINOUS PROPORTIONS OF ENNUI AND OUTSIDE OF THE CONTRADICTORY POSTULATION OF HEIMAT AND INFINITY IT TAKES THE FORM OF THE RETURN TO THE FINITE TO THE IMMEDIATE TO A TERRESTRIAL AND MATERNAL APPEAL. LIKE THE MIND THE HEART CREATES UTOPIAS: AND OF THEM ALL THE STRANGEST IS THE UTOPIA OF A NATAL UNIVERSE WHERE WE REST FROM OURSELVES A UNIVERSE THAT IS THE COSMIC PILLOW OF ALL OUR LASSITUDES.

IN NOSTALGIC ASPIRATION WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING PALPABLE BUT A KIND OF ABSTRACT WARMTH HETEROGENEOUS TO TIME AND CLOSE TO A PARADISIAC PRESENTIMENT. WHATEVER DOES NOT ACCEPT EXISTENCE AS SUCH BORDERS ON THEOLOGY. NOSTALGIA IS MERELY A SENTIMENTAL THEOLOGY IN WHICH THE ABSOLUTE IS BUILT WITH THE ELEMENTS OF DESIRE IN WHICH GOD IS INDETERMINACY ELABORATED BY LANGUOR.

SOLITUDE—SCHISM OF THE HEART
WE ARE DOOMED TO PERDITION EACH TIME LIFE DOES NOT REVEAL ITSELF AS A MIRACLE EACH TIME THE MOMENT NO LONGER MOANS IN A SUPERNATURAL SHUDDER. HOW RENEW THAT SENSATION OF PLENITUDE THOSE SECONDS OF DELIRIUM THOSE VOLCANIC FLASHES THOSE WONDERS OF FERVOR WHICH REDUCE GOD TO AN ACCIDENT OF OUR CLAY? BY WHAT SUBTERFUGE REVIVE THAT EXPLOSION IN WHICH EVEN MUSIC SEEMS SUPERFICIAL THE CASTOFF OF OUR INNER ORGAN?

IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER TO REMEMBER THE SEIZURES WHICH MADE US COINCIDE WITH THE START OF MOVEMENT MADE US MASTERS OF THE FIRST MOMENT OF TIME AND INSTANTANEOUS ARTISANS OF THE CREATION. WE PERCEIVE NO MORE OF CREATION THAN ITS DESTITUTION THE GRIM REALITY; WE LIVE IN ORDER TO UNLEARN ECSTASY. AND IT IS NOT THE MIRACLE WHICH DETERMINES OUR TRADITION AND OUR SUBSTANCE BUT THE VOID OF A UNIVERSE FRUSTRATED OF ITS FLAMES ENGULFED IN ITS OWN ABSENCES EXCLUSIVE OBJECT OF OUR RUMINATION: A LONELY UNIVERSE BEFORE A LONELY HEART EACH PREDESTINED TO DISJOIN AND TO EXASPERATE EACH OTHER IN THE ANTITHESIS. WHEN THE SOLITUDE IS INTENSIFIED TO THE POINT OF CONSTITUTING NOT SO MUCH OUR DATUM AS OUR SOLE FAITH WE CEASE TO BE INTEGRAL WITH THE WHOLE: HERETICS OF EXISTENCE WE ARE BANISHED FROM THE COMMUNITY OF THE LIVING WHOSE SOLE VIRTUE IS TO WAIT GASPING FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT DEATH. BUT WE EMANCIPATED FROM THE FASCINATION OF SUCH WAITING REJECTED FROM THE ECUMENICITY OF ILLUSION—WE ARE THE MOST HERETICAL SECT OF ALL FOR OUR SOUL ITSELF IS BORN IN HERESY.

("WHEN THE SOUL IS IN A STATE OF GRACE ITS BEAUTY IS SO HIGH AND SO ADMIRABLE THAT IT FAR SURPASSES ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE AND DELIGHTS THE EYES OF GOD AND THE ANGELS”—IGNATIUS LOYOLA.

I HAVE SOUGHT TO SETTLE IN AN ORDINARY GRACE; I HAVE TRIED TO LIQUIDATE ALL INTERROGATIONS AND VANISH IN AN IGNORANT LIGHT IN ANY LIGHT DISDAINFUL OF THE INTELLECT. BUT HOW ATTAIN TO THE SIGH OF FELICITY SUPERIOR TO PROBLEMS WHEN NO “BEAUTY” ILLUMINATES YOU AND WHEN GOD AND THE ANGELS ARE BLIND?

ONCE WHEN TERESA PATRON SAINT OF SPAIN AND OF YOUR SOUL PRESCRIBED A COURSE OF TEMPTATIONS AND INTOXICATIONS THE TRANSCENDENT ABYSS AMAZED YOU LIKE A FALL INTO THE HEAVENS. BUT THOSE HEAVENS HAVE VANISHED—LIKE THE TEMPTATIONS AND INTOXICATIONS—AND IN THE COLD HEART THE FEVERS OF AVILA ARE EXTINGUISHED FOREVER.

BY WHAT PECULIARITY OF FATE DO CERTAIN BEINGS HAVING REACHED THE POINT WHERE THEY MIGHT COINCIDE WITH A FAITH RETREAT TO FOLLOW A PATH WHICH LEADS THEM ONLY TO THEMSELVES—AND HENCE NOWHERE? IS IT OUT OF FEAR THAT ONCE INSTALLED IN GRACE THEY MIGHT LOSE THERE THEIR DISTINCT VIRTUES? EACH MAN DEVELOPS AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS DEPTHS EACH MAN IS A MYSTIC WHO DENIES HIMSELF: THE EARTH IS INHABITED BY VARIOUS FORMS OF GRACE MANQUÉ BY TRAMPLED MYSTERIES.)

TWILIGHT THINKERS
ATHENS WAS DYING AND WITH IT THE WORSHIP OF KNOWLEDGE. THE GREAT SYSTEMS HAD RUN THEIR COURSE: LIMITED TO THE CONCEPTUAL REALM THEY REJECTED THE INTERVENTION OF TORMENTS THE PURSUIT OF DELIVERANCE AND OF INORDINATE MEDITATION UPON SUFFERING. THE DECLINING CITY HAVING PERMITTED THE CONVERSION OF HUMAN DISASTERS INTO THEORY NO MATTER WHAT—SNEEZE OR SUDDEN DEATH—WAS SUPPLANTING THE OLD PROBLEMS. THE OBSESSION WITH REMEDIES MARKS THE END OF A CIVILIZATION; THE SEARCH FOR SALVATION THAT OF A PHILOSOPHY. PLATO AND ARISTOTLE HAD YIELDED TO SUCH PREOCCUPATIONS ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF EQUILIBRIUM; AFTER THEM SUCH CONCERNS PREVAILED IN EVERY DOMAIN.

ROME WANING TOOK FROM ATHENS ONLY THE ECHOES OF ITS DECADENCE AND THE REFLECTIONS OF ITS COLLAPSE. WHEN THE GREEKS EXERCISED THEIR DOUBTS THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE THE LATTER’S DOWNFALL AND THAT OF PHILOSOPHY WERE VIRTUALLY CONSUMMATED. ALL QUESTIONS SEEMING LEGITIMATE THE SUPERSTITION OF FORMAL LIMITS NO LONGER PREVENTED THE DEBAUCH OF ARBITRARY CURIOSITIES. THE INFILTRATION OF EPICUREANISM AND OF STOICISM WAS EASY: ETHICS REPLACED THE ABSTRACT STRUCTURES BASTARDIZED REASON BECAME THE INSTRUMENT OF PRAXIS. IN THE STREETS OF ROME WITH VARIOUS RECIPES FOR “HAPPINESS” SWARMED THE EPICUREANS AND THE STOICS EXPERTS IN WISDOM NOBLE CHARLATANS APPEARING AT THE PERIPHERY OF PHILOSOPHY TO TREAT AN INCURABLE AND GENERALIZED LASSITUDE. BUT THEIR THERAPEUTICS LACKED THE MYTHOLOGY AND THE STRANGE ANECDOTES WHICH IN THE UNIVERSAL ENERVATION WERE TO CONSTITUTE THE VIGOR OF A RELIGION UNCONCERNED WITH NUANCE A RELIGION ORIGINATING MORE REMOTELY THAN THEY. WISDOM IS THE LAST WORD OF AN EXPIRING CIVILIZATION THE NIMBUS OF HISTORIC TWILIGHTS FATIGUE TRANSFIGURED INTO A VISION OF THE WORLD THE LAST TOLERANCE BEFORE THE ADVENT OF OTHER NEWER GODS—AND OF BARBARISM; WISDOM WHAT WE CALL SAGESSE IS ALSO A VAIN ATTEMPT AT MELODY AMONG THE ENVIRONING DEATH RATTLES. FOR THE SAGE-—THEORETICIAN OF A LIMPID DEATH HERO OF INDIFFERENCE AND SYMBOL OF THE LAST STAGE OF PHILOSOPHY OF ITS DEGENERESCENCE AND ITS VACUITY—HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF HIS OWN DEATH . . . AND HAS THEREUPON SUPPRESSED ALL PROBLEMS. PROVIDED WITH RARER ABSURDITIES HE IS A LIMIT-CASE WHICH WE ENCOUNTER IN EXTREME PERIODS AS AN EXCEPTIONAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL PATHOLOGY.

FINDING OURSELVES AT A POINT SYMMETRICAL TO THE AGONY OF THE ANCIENT WORLD A VICTIM OF THE SAME SICKNESSES AND UNDER SIMILARLY INELUCTABLE CHARMS WE SEE THE GREAT SYSTEMS DESTROYED BY THEIR LIMITED PERFECTION. FOR US TOO EVERYTHING BECOMES THE SUBSTANCE OF A PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT DIGNITY AND WITHOUT RIGOR. . . . THOUGHT’S IMPERSONAL FATE HAS BEEN SCATTERED INTO A THOUSAND SOULS A THOUSAND HUMILIATIONS OF THE IDEA. . . . NOT LEIBNITZ KANT OR HEGEL ARE OF ANY HELP TO US ANY LONGER. WE HAVE COME WITH OUR OWN DEATH TO THE DOORS OF PHILOSOPHY: ROTTING ON THEIR HINGES HAVING NOTHING MORE TO PROTECT THEY OPEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD . . . AND ANYTHING BECOMES A PHILOSOPHICAL SUBJECT. PARAGRAPHS ARE REPLACED BY CRIES: THE CONSEQUENCE IS A PHILOSOPHY OF THE FUNDUS ANIMAE WHOSE INTIMACY WILL BE RECONNOITERED IN THE APPEARANCES OF HISTORY AND THE SURFACES OF TIME.

WE TOO SEEK “HAPPINESS” EITHER BY FRENZY OR BY DISDAIN: TO SCORN IT IS NOT YET TO FORGET IT AND TO REJECT IT IS A WAY OF RETAINING IT; WE TOO SEEK “SALVATION” IF ONLY BY WANTING NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. AND IF WE ARE THE NEGATIVE HEROES OF AN OVERRIPE AGE THEREBY WE ARE ITS CONTEMPORARIES: TO BETRAY ONE’S AGE OR TO BE ITS FERVENT ADEPT EXPRESSES—IN AN APPARENT CONTRADICTION—ONE AND THE SAME ACT OF PARTICIPATION. THE LOFTY DEFEATS THE SUBTLE DECREPITUDES THE ASPIRATIONS TO TIMELESS HALOS—ALL LEADING TO WISDOM—WHO WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THEM IN HIMSELF? WHO DOES NOT FEEL THE RIGHT TO ASSERT EVERYTHING IN THE VOID AROUND HIM BEFORE THE WORLD VANISHES IN THE DAWN OF AN ABSOLUTE OR OF A NEW NEGATION? A GOD IS ALWAYS THREATENING ON THE HORIZON. WE ARE IN THE MARGIN OF PHILOSOPHY SINCE WE CONSENT TO ITS END. LET US CONDUCT OURSELVES SO THAT THE GOD DOES NOT SETTLE IN OUR THOUGHTS LET US STILL KEEP OUR DOUBTS THE APPEARANCES OF EQUILIBRIUM AND THE TEMPTATION OF IMMANENT DESTINY ANY ARBITRARY AND FANTASTIC ASPIRATION BEING PREFERABLE TO THE INFLEXIBLE TRUTHS. WE CHANGE CURES FINDING NONE EFFECTIVE NONE VALID BECAUSE WE HAVE FAITH NEITHER IN THE PEACE WE SEEK NOR IN THE PLEASURES WE PURSUE. VERSATILE SAGES WE ARE THE STOICS AND EPICUREANS OF MODERN ROMES. . . .

RESOURCES OF SELF-DESTRUCTION
BORN IN A PRISON WITH BURDENS ON OUR SHOULDERS AND OUR THOUGHTS WE COULD NOT REACH THE END OF A SINGLE DAY IF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ENDING IT ALL DID NOT INCITE US TO BEGIN THE NEXT DAY ALL OVER AGAIN. . . . IRONS AND THE UNBREATHABLE AIR OF THIS WORLD STRIP US OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE FREEDOM TO KILL OURSELVES; AND THIS FREEDOM GRANTS US A STRENGTH AND A PRIDE TO TRIUMPH OVER THE LOADS WHICH OVERWHELM US.

WHAT GIFT IS MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT WE WILL WITH OURSELVES AND TO REFUSE TO DO IT? CONSOLATION BY A POSSIBLE SUICIDE WIDENS INTO INFINITE SPACE THIS REALM WHERE WE ARE SUFFOCATING. THE NOTION OF DESTROYING OURSELVES THE MULTIPLICITY OF MEANS FOR DOING SO THEIR EASE AND THEIR PROXIMITY DELIGHT US AND FILL US WITH DREAD; FOR THERE IS NOTHING SIMPLER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE ACTION BY WHICH WE DECIDE IRREVOCABLY UPON OURSELVES. IN A SINGLE SECOND WE DO AWAY WITH ALL SECONDS; GOD HIMSELF COULD NOT DO AS MUCH. BUT BRAGGART DEMONS WE POSTPONE OUR END: HOW COULD WE RENOUNCE THE DISPLAY OF OUR FREEDOM THE SHOW OF OUR PRIDE? . . .

THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER IMAGINED HIS OWN ANNIHILATION WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED RECOURSE TO THE ROPE THE BULLET POISON OR THE SEA IS A DEGRADED GALLEY SLAVE OR A WORM CRAWLING UPON THE COSMIC CARRION. THIS WORLD CAN TAKE EVERYTHING FROM US CAN FORBID US EVERYTHING BUT NO ONE HAS THE POWER TO KEEP US FROM WIPING OURSELVES OUT. EVERY TOOL OFFERS ITS HELP EVERY ABYSS INVITES US IN; BUT ALL OUR INSTINCTS OPPOSE THE ACT. THIS CONTRADICTION DEVELOPS AN INSOLUBLE CONFLICT IN THE MIND. WHEN WE BEGIN TO REFLECT UPON LIFE TO DISCOVER IN IT AN INFINITY OF EMPTINESS OUR INSTINCTS HAVE ALREADY TURNED THEMSELVES INTO GUIDES AND MIDDLEMEN OF OUR ACTS; THEY REIN IN THE FLIGHT OF OUR INSPIRATION AND THE PLIABILITY OF OUR DETACHMENT. IF AT THE MOMENT OF OUR BIRTH WE WERE AS CONSCIOUS AS WE ARE AT THE END OF ADOLESCENCE IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT AT THE AGE OF FIVE SUICIDE WOULD BE A HABITUAL PHENOMENON OR EVEN A QUESTION OF HONOR. BUT WE WAKE TOO LATE: WE HAVE AGAINST US THE YEARS NOURISHED SOLELY BY THE PRESENCE OF THE INSTINCTS WHICH CAN BE ONLY STUPEFIED BY THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH OUR MEDITATIONS AND OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS LEAD. AND THEY REACT; YET HAVING ACQUIRED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR FREEDOM WE ARE MASTERS OF A RESOLVE ALL THE MORE TEMPTING IN THAT WE DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. IT MAKES US ENDURE THE DAYS AND WHAT IS MORE THE NIGHTS; WE ARE NO LONGER POOR OR CRUSHED BY ADVERSITY: WE POSSESS SUPREME RESOURCES. AND EVEN WHEN WE NEVER EXPLOIT THEM WHEN WE EXPIRE IN THE USUAL WAY WE HAVE HAD A TREASURE IN OUR VERY ABANDONMENTS: WHAT GREATER WEALTH THAN THE SUICIDE EACH OF US BEARS WITHIN HIMSELF?

IF THE RELIGIONS HAVE FORBIDDEN US TO DIE BY OUR OWN HAND IT IS BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT SUCH PRACTICES SET AN EXAMPLE OF INSUBORDINATION WHICH HUMILIATED TEMPLES AND GODS ALIKE. THE COUNCIL OF ORLEANS REGARDED SUICIDE AS A SIN MORE GRIEVOUS THAN MURDER FOR THE MURDERER CAN ALWAYS REPENT BE SAVED WHEREAS THE MAN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE HAS PASSED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF SALVATION. BUT THE ACT OF SUICIDE ORIGINATES IN A RADICAL FORMULA OF SALVATION. IS NOT NOTHINGNESS THE EQUAL OF ETERNITY? THE SOLITARY BEING HAS NO NEED TO DECLARE WAR ON THE UNIVERSE—HE SENDS THE ULTIMATUM TO HIMSELF. HE NO LONGER ASPIRES TO BE FOREVER IF IN AN INCOMPARABLE ACTION HE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HIMSELF. HE REJECTS HEAVEN AND EARTH AS HE REJECTS HIMSELF. AT LEAST HE WILL HAVE ACHIEVED A PLENITUDE OF FREEDOM INACCESSIBLE TO THE MAN WHO KEEPS LOOKING FOR IT IN THE FUTURE. . . .

NO CHURCH NO CIVIL INSTITUTION HAS AS YET INVENTED A SINGLE ARGUMENT VALID AGAINST SUICIDE. WHAT ANSWER IS THERE TO THE MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER ENDURE LIFE? NO ONE IS QUALIFIED TO TAKE ANOTHER’S BURDENS UPON HIMSELF. AND WHAT POWER DOES DIALECTIC HAVE AGAINST THE ASSAULT OF IRREFUTABLE DESPAIRS AND AGAINST A THOUSAND UNCONSOLED MANIFESTATIONS? SUICIDE IS ONE OF MAN’S DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS ONE OF HIS DISCOVERIES; NO ANIMAL IS CAPABLE OF IT AND THE ANGELS HAVE SCARCELY GUESSED ITS EXISTENCE; WITHOUT IT HUMAN REALITY WOULD BE LESS CURIOUS LESS PICTURESQUE: WE SHOULD LACK A STRANGE CLIMATE AND A SERIES OF DEADLY POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THEIR AESTHETIC VALUE IF ONLY TO INTRODUCE INTO TRAGEDY CERTAIN NEW SOLUTIONS AND A VARIETY OF DENOUEMENTS.

THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY WHO PUT THEMSELVES TO DEATH AS A PROOF OF THEIR MATURITY HAD CREATED A DISCIPLINE OF SUICIDE WHICH THE MODERNS HAVE UNLEARNED. DOOMED TO AN UNINSPIRED AGONY WE ARE NEITHER AUTHORS OF OUR EXTREMITIES NOR ARBITERS OF OUR ADIEUX; THE END IS NO LONGER OUR END: WE LACK THE EXCELLENCE OF A UNIQUE INITIATIVE—BY WHICH WE MIGHT RANSOM AN INSIPID AND TALENTLESS LIFE AS WE LACK THE SUBLIME CYNICISM THE ANCIENT SPLENDOR OF AN ART OF DYING. HABITUES OF DESPAIR COMPLACENT CORPSES WE ALL OUTLIVE OURSELVES AND DIE ONLY TO FULFILL A FUTILE FORMALITY. IT IS AS IF OUR LIFE WERE ATTACHED TO ITSELF ONLY TO POSTPONE THE MOMENT WHEN WE COULD GET RID OF IT.

THE REACTIONARY ANGELS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SIT IN JUDGMENT ON THE REVOLT OF THE LEAST PHILOSOPHICAL OF THE ANGELS WITHOUT A TINGE OF SYMPATHY AMAZEMENT AND . . . BLAME. INJUSTICE GOVERNS THE UNIVERSE. EVERYTHING WHICH IS DONE AND UNDONE THERE BEARS THE STAMP OF A FILTHY FRAGILITY AS IF MATTER WERE THE FRUIT OF A SCANDAL AT THE CORE OF NOTHINGNESS. EACH BEING FEEDS ON THE AGONY OF SOME OTHER; THE MOMENTS RUSH LIKE VAMPIRES UPON TIME’S ANEMIA; THE WORLD IS A RECEPTACLE OF SOBS. . . . IN THIS SLAUGHTERHOUSE TO FOLD ONE’S ARMS OR TO DRAW ONE’S SWORD ARE EQUALLY VAIN GESTURES. NO PROUD FRENZY CAN SHAKE SPACE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS OR ENNOBLE MEN’S SOULS. TRIUMPHS AND FAILURES FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER ACCORDING TO AN UNKNOWN LAW NAMED DESTINY A NAME TO WHICH WE RESORT WHEN PHILOSOPHICALLY UNPROVIDED FOR OUR SOJOURN HERE ON EARTH OR ANYWHERE SEEMS INSOLUBLE TO US A KIND OF CURSE TO ENDURE SENSELESS AND UNDESERVED. DESTINY—FAVORITE WORD IN THE VOCABULARY OF THE VANQUISHED. . . . GREEDY FOR A NOMENCLATURE OF THE IRREMEDIABLE WE SEEK RELIEF IN VERBAL INVENTION IN LIGHTS SUSPENDED OVER OUR DISASTERS. WORDS ARE CHARITABLE: THEIR FRAIL REALITY DECEIVES AND CONSOLES US. . . .

THUS “DESTINY” WHICH CAN WILL NOTHING IS WHAT HAS WILLED WHAT HAPPENS TO US. . . . INFATUATED WITH THE IRRATIONAL AS THE SOLE MODE OF EXPLANATION WE WATCH IT TIP THE SCALE OF OUR FATE WHICH WEIGHS ONLY NEGATIVE ELEMENTS. WHERE FIND THE PRIDE TO PROVOKE THE FORCES WHICH HAVE SO DECREED AND WHAT IS MORE ARE NOT TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DECREE? AGAINST WHOM WAGE THE STRUGGLE AND WHERE LEAD THE ASSAULT WHEN INJUSTICE HAUNTS THE AIR OF OUR LUNGS THE SPACE OF OUR THOUGHTS THE SILENCE AND THE STUPOR OF THE STARS? OUR REVOLT IS AS ILL CONCEIVED AS THE WORLD WHICH PROVOKES IT. HOW TAKE IT ON OURSELVES TO RIGHT WRONGS WHEN LIKE DON QUIXOTE ON HIS DEATHBED WE HAVE LOST—MADNESS AT ITS END EXHAUSTED—VIGOR AND ILLUSION TO CONFRONT THE HIGHROADS COMBATS AND DEFEATS? AND HOW REGAIN THE ENERGY OF THAT SEDITIOUS ANGEL WHO STILL AT TIME’S START KNEW NOTHING OF THAT PESTILENTIAL WISDOM IN WHICH OUR IMPULSES ASPHYXIATE? WHERE FIND ENOUGH VERVE AND PRESUMPTION TO STIGMATIZE THE HERD OF THE OTHER ANGELS WHILE HERE ON EARTH TO FOLLOW THEIR COLLEAGUE IS TO CAST ONESELF STILL LOWER WHILE MEN’S INJUSTICE IMITATES GOD’S AND ALL REBELLION SETS THE SOUL AGAINST INFINITY AND BREAKS IT THERE? THE ANONYMOUS ANGELS—HUDDLED UNDER THEIR AGELESS WINGS ETERNALLY VICTORS AND VANQUISHED IN GOD NUMB TO THE DEADLY CURIOSITIES DREAMERS PARALLEL TO THE EARTHLY GRIEFS—WHO WOULD DARE TO CAST THE FIRST STONE AT THEM AND IN DEFIANCE DIVIDE THEIR SLEEP? REVOLT THE PRIDE OF DOWNFALL TAKES ITS NOBILITY ONLY FROM ITS USELESSNESS: SUFFERINGS AWAKEN IT AND THEN ABANDON IT; FRENZY EXALTS IT AND DISAPPOINTMENT DENIES IT. . . . REVOLT CANNOT HAVE A MEANING IN A NON-VALID UNIVERSE. . . .

(IN THIS WORLD NOTHING IS IN ITS PLACE BEGINNING WITH THIS WORLD ITSELF. WE MUST THEREFORE NOT BE SURPRISED BY THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN INJUSTICE. IT IS EQUALLY FUTILE TO REFUSE OR TO ACCEPT THE SOCIAL ORDER: WE MUST ENDURE ITS CHANGES FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE WITH A DESPAIRING CONFORMISM AS WE ENDURE BIRTH LOVE THE WEATHER AND DEATH. DECOMPOSITION PRESIDES OVER THE LAWS OF LIFE: CLOSER TO OUR DUST THAN INANIMATE OBJECTS TO THEIRS WE SUCCUMB BEFORE THEM AND RASH UPON OUR DESTINY UNDER THE GAZE OF THE APPARENTLY INDESTRUCTIBLE STARS. BUT THEY THEMSELVES WILL CRUMBLE IN A UNIVERSE WHICH ONLY OUR HEART TAKES SERIOUSLY LATER EXPIATING ITS LACK OF IRONY BY TERRIBLE LACERATIONS. . . .

NO ONE CAN CORRECT GOD’S INJUSTICE OR THAT OF MEN: EVERY ACTION IS MERELY A SPECIAL APPARENTLY ORGANIZED CASE OF THE ORIGINAL CHAOS. WE ARE SWEPT ON BY A WHIRLWIND WHICH DATES BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME; AND IF THIS WHIRLWIND HAS ASSUMED THE ASPECT OF AN ORDER IT IS ONLY THE BETTER TO DO AWAY WITH US. . . .)

THE CONCERN FOR DECENCY
UNDER THE GOAD OF PAIN THE FLESH AWAKENS; LUCID AND LYRICAL SUBSTANCE IT SINGS ITS DISSOLUTION. SO LONG AS IT WAS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM NATURE IT RESTED IN THE OBLIVION OF ELEMENTS: THE SELF HAD NOT YET SEIZED UPON IT. SUFFERING MATTER FREES ITSELF FROM GRAVITATION NO LONGER PARTICIPATES IN THE UNIVERSE ISOLATES ITSELF FROM THE SOMNOLENT SUM; FOR PAIN AN AGENT OF SEPARATION THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUATION DENIES THE PLEASURES OF A STATISTICAL DESTINY.

THE TRULY SOLITARY BEING IS NOT THE MAN WHO IS ABANDONED BY MEN BUT THE MAN WHO SUFFERS IN THEIR MIDST WHO DRAGS HIS DESERT THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE AND DEPLOYS HIS TALENTS AS A SMILING LEPER A MOUNTEBANK OF THE IRREPARABLE. THE GREAT SOLITARIES WERE HAPPY IN THE OLD DAYS KNEW NOTHING OF DUPLICITY HAD NOTHING TO HIDE: THEY CONVERSED ONLY WITH THEIR OWN SOLITUDE. . . .

OF ALL THE BONDS WHICH LINK US TO THINGS THERE IS NOT ONE WHICH FAILS TO SLACKEN AND DISSOLVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUFFERING WHICH FREES US FROM EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE OBSESSION OF OURSELVES AND THE SENSATION OF BEING IRREVOCABLY INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING IS SOLITUDE HYPOSTATIZED AS ESSENCE BY WHAT MEANS THEN COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS EXCEPT BY THE PRESTIDIGITATION OF LYING? FOR IF WE WERE NOT JUGGLERS IF WE HAD NOT LEARNED THE ARTIFICES OF A KNOWING CHARLATANISM IF INDEED WE WERE SINCERE TO THE POINT OF SHAMELESSNESS OR TRAGEDY—OUR UNDERGROUND WORLDS WOULD VOMIT UP OCEANS OF GALL IN WHICH IT WOULD BE A POINT OF HONOR FOR US TO VANISH: THEREBY WE SHOULD FLEE THE UNSEEMLINESS OF SO MUCH GROTESQUERIE AND SUBLIMITY. AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MISERY ALL FRANKNESS BECOMES INDECENT. JOB STOPPED JUST IN TIME: ONE STEP FURTHER AND NEITHER GOD NOR HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE ANSWERED HIM AGAIN.

(ONE IS “CIVILIZED” INSOFAR AS ONE DOES NOT PROCLAIM ONE’S LEPROSY AS ONE EVINCES RESPECT FOR THE ELEGANT FALSEHOODS FORGED BY THE AGES. NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO STAGGER UNDER THE BURDEN OF HIS HOURS . . . EVERY MAN HARBORS A POSSIBILITY OF APOCALYPSE BUT EVERY MAN MAKES IT A RULE TO LEVEL HIS OWN ABYSSES. IF EACH OF US GAVE FREE REIN TO HIS SOLITUDE GOD WOULD HAVE TO REMAKE THE WORLD WHOSE EXISTENCE DEPENDS AT EVERY POINT ON OUR EDUCATION AND ON THIS FEAR WE HAVE OF OURSELVES. . . CHAOS? CHAOS IS REJECTING ALL YOU HAVE LEARNED CHAOS IS BEING YOURSELF. . .)

GAMUT OF THE VOID
I HAVE SEEN ONE MAN PURSUE THIS GOAL ANOTHER THAT ONE; I HAVE SEEN MEN FASCINATED BY DISPARATE OBJECTS UNDER THE SPELL OF DREAMS AND PLANS AT ONCE VILE AND INDEFINABLE. ANALYZING EACH CASE IN ISOLATION IN ORDER TO PENETRATE THE REASONS FOR SO MUCH FERVOR SQUANDERED I HAVE REALIZED THE NON-MEANING OF ALL ACTION AND ALL EFFORT. IS THERE A SINGLE LIFE WHICH IS NOT IMPREGNATED WITH LIFE-GIVING ERRORS A SINGLE CLEAR TRANSPARENT LIFE WITHOUT HUMILIATING ROOTS WITHOUT INVENTED MOTIVES WITHOUT MYTHS EMERGING FROM DESIRES? WHERE IS THE ACTION PURE OF ALL UTILITY: SUN ABHORRING INCANDESCENCE ANGEL IN A UNIVERSE WITHOUT FAITH OR IDLE WORM IN A WORLD ABANDONED TO IMMORTALITY?

I HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST MEN TO REACT AGAINST THEIR MADNESS TO DISCERN ITS SOURCE; I HAVE LISTENED AND I HAVE SEEN—AND I HAVE BEEN AFRAID—AFRAID OF ACTING FOR THE SAME MOTIVES OR FOR ANY MOTIVE WHATEVER OF BELIEVING IN THE SAME GHOSTS OR IN ANY OTHER GHOST OF LETTING MYSELF BE ENGULFED BY DIE SAME INTOXICATIONS OR BY SOME OTHER . . . AFRAID IN SHORT OF RAVING IN COMMON AND OF EXPIRING IN A HORDE OF ECSTASIES. I KNEW THAT BY SEPARATING FROM SOMEONE I WAS DISPOSSESSED OF A FALLACY I WAS DEPRIVED OF THE ILLUSION I WAS LOVING HIM . . . HIS FEVERISH WORDS REVEALED HIM THE CAPTIVE OF AN EVIDENCE ABSOLUTE FOR HIM AND ABSURD FOR ME; ON CONTACT WITH HIS VACUITY I STRIPPED MYSELF OF MINE. . . . WHOM CAN WE ADHERE TO WITHOUT THE FEELING OF DECEPTION—WITHOUT BLUSHING? WE CAN JUSTIFY ONLY THE MAN WHO PRACTICES IN FULL AWARENESS THE IRRATIONAL NECESSARY TO EVERY ACTION AND WHO EMBELLISHES WITH NO DREAM THE FICTION TO WHICH HE SURRENDERS HIMSELF AS WE CAN ADMIRE ONLY A HERO WHO DIES WITHOUT CONVICTION ALL THE MORE READY FOR SACRIFICE IN THAT HE HAS SEEN THROUGH IT. AS FOR LOVERS THEY WOULD BE HATEFUL IF AMONG THEIR GRIMACES THE PRESENTIMENT OF DEATH DID NOT HOVER CARESSING. . . . IT IS DISTURBING TO THINK THAT WE CARRY OUR SECRET—OUR ILLUSION—INTO THE GRAVE THAT WE HAVE NOT SURVIVED THE MYSTERIOUS MISTAKE THAT VIVIFIED OUR EVERY BREATH THAT EXCEPT FOR THE SKEPTICS AND WHORES AMONG US ALL FOUNDER IN FALSEHOOD BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO DIVINE THE EQUIVALENCE IN NULLITY OF TRIUMPHS AND TRUTHS.

I WANTED TO SUPPRESS IN MYSELF THE REASONS MEN INVOKE IN ORDER TO EXIST IN ORDER TO ACT. I WANTED TO BECOME UNSPEAKABLY NORMAL—AND HERE I AM IN DAZED CONFUSION ON A FOOTING WITH FOOLS AND AS EMPTY AS THEY.

CERTAIN MORNINGS
REGRET NOT TO BE ATLAS NOT TO BE ABLE TO SHRUG MY SHOULDERS AND WATCH THE COLLAPSE OF THIS LAUGHABLE MATTER. . . . RAGE TAKES THE OPPOSITE PATH OF COSMOGONY. BY WHAT MYSTERIES DO WE WAKE CERTAIN MORNINGS WITH THE THIRST TO DEMOLISH THE WHOLE OF CREATION INERT AND ANIMATE ALIKE? WHEN THE DEVIL DROWNS HIMSELF IN OUR VEINS WHEN OUR IDEAS TURN CONVULSIVE AND OUR DESIRES CLEAVE THE LIGHT THE ELEMENTS CATCH FIRE AND CONSUME THEMSELVES WHILE OUR FINGERS SIFT THEIR ASHES.

WHAT NIGHTMARES HAVE WE SUSTAINED FOR NIGHTS ON END TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNINGS ENEMIES OF THE SUN? MUST WE LIQUIDATE OURSELVES TO PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING? WHAT COMPLICITY WHAT BONDS EXTEND US INTO AN INTIMACY WITH TIME? LIFE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE WITHOUT THE FORCES WHICH DENY IT. MASTERS OF A POSSIBLE EXIT OF THE IDEA OF AN ESCAPE WE MIGHT READILY ABOLISH OURSELVES AND AT THE APEX OF DELIRIUM EXPECTORATE THIS UNIVERSE.

. . . OR ELSE PRAY AND WAIT FOR OTHER MORNINGS.

(TO WRITE WOULD BE AN INSIPID AND SUPERFLUOUS ACTION IF WE COULD WEEP AT WILL IMITATING WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THEIR FITS OF RAGE. . . . IN THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH WE ARE MADE IN ITS DEEPEST IMPURITY ABIDES A PRINCIPLE OF BITTERNESS WHICH ONLY TEARS CAN SWEETEN. IF EACH TIME DISAPPOINTMENTS ASSAIL US WE HAD THE POSSIBILITY TO BE RELEASED FROM THEM BY TEARS ALL VAGUE MALADIES AND POETRY ITSELF WOULD DISAPPEAR. BUT A NATIVE RETICENCE AGGRAVATED BY EDUCATION OR A DEFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE LACHRYMAL GLANDS DOOMS US TO THE MARTYRDOM OF DRY EYES. AND THEN SHRIEKS STORMS OF SWEARING SELF-MACERATION AND FINGERNAILS FURROWING THE FLESH WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF A SPECTACLE OF BLOOD NO LONGER FIGURE AMONG OUR THERAPEUTIC METHODS. IT FOLLOWS THAT WE ARE ALL SICK AND THAT EACH OF US WOULD REQUIRE A SAHARA IN ORDER TO SCREAM OUR LUNGS OUT OR THE SHORES OF A WILD AND ELEGIAC SEA IN ORDER TO MINGLE WITH ITS FIERCE LAMENTATIONS OUR EVEN FIERCER ONES. OUR PAROXYSMS REQUIRE THE CONTEXT OF A PARODIC SUBLIMITY OF AN APOPLECTIC INFINITY THE VISION OF A HANGING WHERE THE FIRMAMENT WOULD SERVE AS A GALLOWS TO OUR CARCASSES AND TO THE ELEMENTS.)

MILITANT MOURNING
ALL TRUTHS ARE AGAINST US. BUT WE GO ON LIVING BECAUSE WE ACCEPT THEM IN THEMSELVES BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO DRAW THE CONSEQUENCES. WHERE IS THE MAN WHO HAS TRANSLATED—IN HIS BEHAVIOR—A SINGLE CONCLUSION OF THE LESSONS OF ASTRONOMY OF BIOLOGY AND WHO HAS DECIDED NEVER TO LEAVE HIS BED AGAIN OUT OF REBELLION OR HUMILITY IN THE FACE OF THE SIDEREAL DISTANCES OR THE NATURAL PHENOMENA? HAS PRIDE EVER BEEN CONQUERED BY THE EVIDENCE OF OUR UNREALITY? AND WHO WAS EVER BOLD ENOUGH TO DO NOTHING BECAUSE EVERY ACTION IS SENSELESS IN INFINITY? THE SCIENCES PROVE OUR NOTHINGNESS. BUT WHO HAS GRASPED THEIR ULTIMATE TEACHING? WHO HAS BECOME A HERO OF TOTAL SLOTH? NO ONE FOLDS HIS ARMS: WE ARE BUSIER THAN THE ANTS AND THE BEES. YET IF AN ANT IF A BEE—BY THE MIRACLE OF AN IDEA OR BY SOME TEMPTATION OF SINGULARITY— WERE TO ISOLATE HERSELF IN THE ANTHILL OR THE HIVE IF SHE CONTEMPLATED FROM OUTSIDE THE SPECTACLE OF HER LABORS WOULD SHE STILL PERSIST IN HER PAINS?

ONLY THE RATIONAL ANIMAL HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEARN NOTHING FROM HIS PHILOSOPHY: HE LOCATES HIMSELF APART—AND PERSEVERES NONETHELESS IN THE SAME ERRORS OF EFFECTIVE APPEARANCE AND VOID REALITY. SEEN FROM OUTSIDE FROM ANY ARCHIMEDEAN POINT LIFE—WITH ALL ITS BELIEFS—IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE NOR EVEN CONCEIVABLE. WE CAN ACT ONLY AGAINST THE TRUTH. MAN STARTS OVER AGAIN EVERY DAY IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING HE KNOWS AGAINST EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE HAS EXTENDED THIS AMBIGUITY TO THE POINT OF VICE: PERSPICACITY IS IN MOURNING BUT—STRANGE CONTAGION—THIS VERY MOURNING IS ACTIVE; THUS WE ARE LED INTO A FUNERAL PROCESSION TO THE LAST JUDGMENT; THUS OUT OF THE ULTIMATE REST ITSELF OUT OF HISTORY’S FINAL SILENCE WE HAVE MADE AN ACTIVITY: THE STAGING OF THE AGONY THE NEED FOR DYNAMISM EVEN IN THE DEATH-RATTLES. . . .

(THE PANTING CIVILIZATIONS EXHAUST THEMSELVES FASTER THAN THOSE THAT LOLL IN ETERNITY. CHINA ALONE THRIVING FOR MILLENNIA IN THE FLOWER OF HER OLD AGE OFFERS AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED; CHINA ALONE LONG SINCE ARRIVED AT A REFINED WISDOM SUPERIOR TO PHILOSOPHY: TAOISM SURPASSES ALL THE MIND HAS CONCEIVED BY WAY OF DETACHMENT. WE COUNT BY GENERATIONS: IT IS THE CURSE OF SCARCELY CENTURY-OLD CIVILIZATIONS TO HAVE LOST IN THEIR RUSHED CADENCE THE ATEMPORAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

BY ALL EVIDENCE WE ARE IN THE WORLD TO DO NOTHING; BUT INSTEAD OF NONCHALANTLY PROMENADING OUR CORRUPTION WE EXUDE OUR SWEAT AND GROW WINDED UPON THE FETID AIR. ALL HISTORY IS IN A STATE OF PUTREFACTION; ITS ODORS SHIFT TOWARD THE FUTURE: WE RUSH TOWARD IT IF ONLY FOR THE FEVER INHERENT IN ANY DECOMPOSITION.

IT IS TOO LATE FOR HUMANITY TO BE RELEASED FROM THE ILLUSION OF ACTION IT IS ESPECIALLY TOO LATE FOR IT TO BE RAISED TO THE SANCTITY OF SLOTH)

IMMUNITY TO RENUNCIATION
EVERYTHING WHICH DEALS WITH ETERNITY INEVITABLY TURNS INTO A COMMONPLACE. THE WORLD ENDS BY ACCEPTING ANY REVELATION AND RESIGNS ITSELF TO ANY SHUDDER PROVIDED THAT A FORMULA IS FOUND FOR IT. THE NOTION OF UNIVERSAL FUTILITY—MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY SCOURGE—HAS BEEN DEBASED INTO THE OBVIOUS: EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES AS MUCH AND NO ONE BEHAVES ACCORDINGLY. THE TERROR OF AN ULTIMATE TRUTH HAS BEEN TAMED; ONCE IT TURNS INTO A REFRAIN MEN NO LONGER THINK ABOUT IT FOR THEY HAVE LEARNED BY HEART A THING WHICH MERELY GLIMPSED SHOULD CAST THEM INTO THE ABYSS OR SALVATION. THE VISION OF TIME’S NULLITY HAS BEGOTTEN SAINTS AND POETS AND THE DESPAIRS OF A FEW SOLITARIES INFATUATED WITH ANATHEMA. . . .

THIS VISION IS NO NEWS TO THE CROWD; THE CROWD CONTINUALLY ASKS: “WHAT’S THE USE?"; “WHAT DOES IT MATTER?"; “IT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME"; “PLUS ÇA CHANGE . . . “—AND YET NOTHING HAPPENS NOTHING INTERVENES: NOT ONE SAINT NOT ONE POET MORE. .. . IF THE CROWD CONFORMED TO A SINGLE ONE OF THESE REFRAINS THE FACE OF THE WORLD WOULD BE TRANSFORMED. BUT ETERNITY—APPEARING FROM AN ANTI-VITAL THOUGHT—CANNOT BE A HUMAN REFLEX WITHOUT DANGER FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ACTIONS: IT BECOMES A COMMONPLACE SO THAT WE CAN FORGET IT BY A MECHANICAL REPETITION. SANCTITY IS A RISK LIKE POETRY. MEN SAY “EVERYTHING PASSES"—BUT HOW MANY GRASP THE BEARING OF THIS TERRIFYING BANALITY? HOW MANY FLEE LIFE CELEBRATE OR BEWAIL IT? WHO IS NOT IMBUED WITH THE CONVICTION THAT ALL IS VANITY? BUT WHO DARES CONFRONT THE CONSEQUENCES? THE MAN WITH A METAPHYSICAL VOCATION IS RARER THAN A MONSTER—AND YET EACH MAN CONTAINS THE POTENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THIS VOCATION. IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ONE HINDU PRINCE TO SEE A CRIPPLE AN OLD MAN AND A CORPSE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING; WE SEE THEM AND UNDERSTAND NOTHING FOR NOTHING CHANGES IN OUR LIFE. WE CANNOT RENOUNCE ANYTHING; YET THE EVIDENCES OF VANITY ARE IN OUR REACH. INVALIDS OF HOPE WE ARE STILL WAITING; AND LIFE IS ONLY THE HYPOSTATIZATION OF WAITING. WE WAIT FOR EVERYTHING—EVEN NOTHINGNESS—RATHER THAN BE REDUCED TO AN ETERNAL SUSPENSION TO A CONDITION OF NEUTRAL DIVINITY OF A CORPSE. THUS THE HEART WHICH HAS MADE THE IRREPARABLE INTO AN AXIOM STILL HOPES FOR SURPRISES FROM IT. HUMANITY LIVES IN LOVE WITH THE EVENTS WHICH DENY IT. . . .

THE WORLD’S EQUILIBRIUM
THE APPARENT SYMMETRY OF JOYS AND PAINS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION: IT RESULTS FROM THE INJUSTICE WHICH STRIKES CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS THEREBY FORCING THEM TO COMPENSATE BY THEIR DESPONDENCY FOR THE OTHERS' UNCONCERN. TO ENDURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS OR TO BE SAVED FROM THEM—SUCH IS THE LOT OF MEN. THIS DISCRIMINATION IS EFFECTED WITHOUT ANY CRITERION: IT IS A FATALITY AN ABSURD APPORTIONMENT A FANTASTIC SELECTION. NO ONE CAN ELUDE THE CONDEMNATION TO HAPPINESS OR MISERY NOR THE INNATE SENTENCE AT THE PREPOSTEROUS TRIBUNAL WHOSE DECISION EXTENDS BETWEEN THE SPERMATOZOON AND THE SEPULCHER.

SOME MEN PAY FOR ALL THEIR JOYS EXPIATE ALL THEIR PLEASURES ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL THEIR INTERVALS OF OBLIVION: THEY WILL NEVER BE INDEBTED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT OF HAPPINESS. FOR THEM A THOUSAND ACRIMONIES HAVE CROWNED A SHUDDER OF PLEASURE AS IF THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGED CONTENTMENTS AS IF THEIR ABANDONMENT ENDANGERED THE WORLD’S BESTIAL EQUILIBRIUM. . . . WERE THEY HAPPY IN SOME LANDSCAPE?—THEY WILL REGRET IT IN IMMINENT DISAPPOINTMENTS; WERE THEY PROUD IN THEIR PLANS AND THEIR DREAMS? THEY WILL SOON WAKE AS FROM A UTOPIA CORRECTED BY ALL-TOO-POSITIVE SUFFERINGS.

THUS THERE ARE SACRIFICED MEN WHO PAY FOR THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF OTHERS WHO EXPIATE NOT ONLY THEIR OWN HAPPINESS BUT THAT OF STRANGERS. THUS EQUILIBRIUM IS RESTORED; THE PROPORTION OF JOYS AND PAINS BECOMES HARMONIOUS. IF AN OBSCURE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE HAS DECREED THAT YOU BELONG TO THE ORDER OF VICTIMS YOU WILL END YOUR DAYS STAMPING UNDERFOOT THE SPECK OF PARADISE YOU HID WITHIN YOURSELF AND WHATEVER IMPULSE GLEAMED IN YOUR EYES AND YOUR DREAMS WILL BE SULLIED BY THE IMPURITY OF TIME MATTER AND MEN. YOU WILL HAVE A DUNGHEAP FOR PEDESTAL FOR TRIBUNE A RACK AND THUMB SCREW. YOU WILL BE WORTHY OF NO MORE THAN A LEPROUS GLORY AND A CROWN OF SPIT. TRY TO WALK BESIDE THOSE ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING TO WHOM ALL PATHS ARE OPEN? BUT DUST AND ASHES THEMSELVES WILL RISE UP TO BAR YOU FROM THE EXITS OF TIME AND THE EVASIONS OF DREAMS. WHATEVER DIRECTION YOU TAKE YOUR STEPS WILL BE MIRED YOUR VOICES WILL PROCLAIM ONLY THE HYMNS OF MUD AND OVER YOUR BENT HEADS YOUR HEAVY HEARTS IN WHICH ONLY SELF-PITY DWELLS WILL PASS NO MORE THAN THE BREATH OF THE HAPPY BLESSED TOYS OF A NAMELESS IRONY AS LITTLE TO BLAME AS YOU ARE.

FAREWELL TO PHILOSOPHY
I TURNED AWAY FROM PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER IN KANT ANY HUMAN WEAKNESS ANY AUTHENTIC ACCENT OF MELANCHOLY; IN KANT AND IN ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS. COMPARED TO MUSIC MYSTICISM AND POETRY PHILOSOPHICAL ACTIVITY PROCEEDS FROM A DIMINISHED IMPULSE AND A SUSPECT DEPTH PRESTIGIOUS ONLY FOR THE TIMID AND THE TEPID. MOREOVER PHILOSOPHY—IMPERSONAL ANXIETY REFUGE AMONG ANEMIC IDEAS—IS THE RECOURSE OF ALL WHO WOULD ELUDE THE CORRUPTING EXUBERANCE OF LIFE. ALMOST ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS CAME TO A GOOD END: THAT IS THE SUPREME ARGUMENT AGAINST PHILOSOPHY. EVEN SOCRATES' DEATH HAS NOTHING TRAGIC ABOUT IT: IT IS A MISUNDERSTANDING THE END OF A PEDAGOGUE—AND IF NIETZSCHE FOUNDERED IT WAS AS A POET AND VISIONARY: HE EXPIATED HIS ECSTASIES AND NOT HIS ARGUMENTS.

WE CANNOT ELUDE EXISTENCE BY EXPLANATIONS WE CAN ONLY ENDURE IT LOVE OR HATE IT ADORE OR DREAD IT IN THAT ALTERNATION OF HAPPINESS AND HORROR WHICH EXPRESSES THE VERY RHYTHM OF BEING ITS OSCILLATIONS ITS DISSONANCES ITS BRIGHT OR BITTER VEHEMENCES.

EXPOSED BY SURPRISE OR NECESSITY TO AN IRREFUTABLE DEFEAT WHO DOES NOT RAISE HIS HANDS IN PRAYER THEN ONLY TO LET THEM FALL EMPTIER STILL FOR THE ANSWERS OF PHILOSOPHY? IT WOULD SEEM THAT ITS MISSION IS TO PROTECT US AS LONG AS FATE’S NEGLECT ALLOWS US TO PROCEED ON THE BRINK OF CHAOS AND TO ABANDON US AS SOON AS WE ARE FORCED TO PLUNGE OVER THE EDGE. AND HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE WHEN WE SEE HOW LITTLE OF HUMANITY’S SUFFERING HAS PASSED INTO ITS PHILOSOPHY? THE PHILOSOPHIC EXERCISE IS NOT FRUITFUL; IT IS MERELY HONORABLE. WE ARE ALWAYS PHILOSOPHERS WITH IMPUNITY: A MÉTIER WITHOUT FATE WHICH POURS VOLUMINOUS THOUGHTS INTO OUR NEUTRAL AND VACANT HOURS THE HOURS REFRACTORY TO THE OLD TESTAMENT TO BACH AND TO SHAKESPEARE. AND HAVE THESE THOUGHTS MATERIALIZED INTO A SINGLE PAGE THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO ONE OF JOB’S EXCLAMATIONS OF MACBETH’S TERRORS OR THE ALTITUDE OF ONE OF BACH’S CANTATAS? WE DO NOT ARGUE THE UNIVERSE; WE EXPRESS IT. AND PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT EXPRESS IT. THE REAL PROBLEMS BEGIN ONLY AFTER HAVING RANGED OR EXHAUSTED IT AFTER THE LAST CHAPTER OF A HUGE TOME WHICH PRINTS THE FINAL PERIOD AS AN ABDICATION BEFORE THE UNKNOWN IN WHICH ALL OUR MOMENTS ARE ROOTED AND WITH WHICH WE MUST STRUGGLE BECAUSE IT IS NATURALLY MORE IMMEDIATE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR DAILY BREAD. HERE THE PHILOSOPHER LEAVES US: ENEMY OF DISASTER HE IS SANE AS REASON ITSELF AND AS PRUDENT. AND WE REMAIN IN THE COMPANY OF AN OLD PLAGUE VICTIM OF A POET LEARNED IN EVERY LUNACY AND OF A MUSICIAN WHOSE SUBLIMITY TRANSCENDS THE SPHERE OF THE HEART. WE BEGIN TO EVE AUTHENTICALLY ONLY WHERE PHILOSOPHY ENDS AT ITS WRECK WHEN WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD ITS TERRIBLE NULLITY WHEN WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS FUTILE TO RESORT TO IT THAT IT IS NO HELP.

(THE GREAT SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY NO MORE THAN BRILLIANT TAUTOLOGIES. WHAT ADVANTAGE IS IT TO KNOW THAT THE NATURE OF BEING CONSISTS IN THE “WILL TO LIVE” IN “IDEA” OR IN THE WHIM OF GOD OR OF CHEMISTRY? A MERE PROLIFERATION OF WORDS SUBTLE DISPLACEMENTS OF MEANINGS. WHAT IS LOATHES THE VERBAL EMBRACE AND OUR INMOST EXPERIENCE REVEALS US NOTHING BEYOND THE PRIVILEGED AND INEXPRESSIBLE MOMENT. MOREOVER BEING ITSELF IS ONLY A PRETENSION OF NOTHINGNESS.

WE DEFINE ONLY OUT OF DESPAIR. WE MUST HAVE A FORMULA WE MUST EVEN HAVE MANY IF ONLY TO GIVE JUSTIFICATION TO THE MIND AND A FACADE TO THE VOID.

NEITHER CONCEPT NOR ECSTASY ARE FUNCTIONAL. WHEN MUSIC PLUNGES US INTO THE “INWARDNESS” OF BEING WE RAPIDLY RETURN TO THE SURFACE: THE EFFECTS OF THE ILLUSION SCATTER AND OUR KNOWLEDGE ADMITS ITS NULLITY.

THE THINGS WE TOUCH AND THOSE WE CONCEIVE ARE AS IMPROBABLE AS OUR SENSES AND OUR REASON; WE ARE SURE ONLY IN OUR VERBAL UNIVERSE MANAGEABLE AT WILL—AND INEFFECTUAL. BEING IS MUTE AND THE MIND IS GARRULOUS. THIS IS CALLED KNOWING.

THE PHILOSOPHER’S ORIGINALITY COMES DOWN TO INVENTING TERMS. SINCE THERE ARE ONLY THREE OR FOUR ATTITUDES BY WHICH TO CONFRONT THE WORLD— AND ABOUT AS MANY WAYS OF DYING—THE NUANCES WHICH MULTIPLY AND DIVERSIFY THEM DERIVE FROM NO MORE THAN THE CHOICE OF WORDS BEREFT OF ANY METAPHYSICAL RANGE.

WE ARE ENGULFED IN A PLEONASTIC UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AMOUNT TO THE SAME THING.)

FRONT SAINT TO CYNIC
MOCKERY HAS DEGRADED EVERYTHING TO THE RANK OF A PRETEXT EXCEPT FOR THE SUN AND HOPE EXCEPT FOR THE TWO CONDITIONS OF LIFE: THE WORLD’S CENTER AND THE HEART’S THE ONE DAZZLING THE OTHER INVISIBLE. A SKELETON WARMING IN THE SUN AND HOPING WOULD BE MORE VIGOROUS THAN A DESPAIRING HERCULES WEARY OF THE LIGHT; A BEING TOTALLY PERMEABLE TO HOPE WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD AND MORE VITAL THAN LIFE. MACBETH “AWEARY OF THE SUN” IS THE LAST OF CREATURES TRUE DEATH NOT BEING CORRUPTION BUT THE DISGUST WITH OUR IRRADIATION THE REPULSION FOR ALL THAT IS A SEED FOR ALL THAT GROWS IN THE WARMTH OF ILLUSION.

MAN HAS PROFANED THE THINGS WHICH ARE BORN AND DIE UNDER THE SUN EXCEPT FOR THE SUN; THE THINGS WHICH ARE BORN AND DIE IN HOPE EXCEPT FOR HOPE. NOT HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO GO FURTHER HE HAS IMPOSED LIMITS UPON HIS CYNICISM. A CYNIC WHO CLAIMS TO BE CONSISTENT IS A CYNIC IN WORDS ONLY; HIS GESTURES MAKE HIM THE MOST CONTRADICTORY BEING: NO ONE CAN LIVE AFTER HAVING DECIMATED HIS SUPERSTITIONS. TO REACH TOTAL CYNICISM WOULD REQUIRE AN EFFORT WHICH IS THE CONVERSE OF SANCTITY’S AND AT LEAST AS CONSIDERABLE; OR ELSE IMAGINE A SAINT WHO HAVING REACHED THE PINNACLE OF HIS PURIFICATION DISCOVERS THE VANITY OF THE TROUBLE HE HAS TAKEN—AND THE ABSURDITY OF GOD. . . .

SUCH A MONSTER OF LUCIDITY WOULD CHANGE THE DATA OF LIFE: HE WOULD HAVE THE STRENGTH AND THE AUTHORITY TO QUESTION THE VERY CONDITIONS OF HIS EXISTENCE; HE WOULD NO LONGER BE IN DANGER OF CONTRADICTING HIMSELF; NO HUMAN FAILING WOULD THEN WEAKEN HIS AUDACITIES; HAVING LOST THE RELIGIOUS RESPECT WE PAY DESPITE OURSELVES TO OUR LAST ILLUSIONS HE WOULD MAKE A PLAYTHING OF HIS HEART AND OF THE SUN. . . .

RETURN TO THE ELEMENTS
IF PHILOSOPHY HAD MADE NO PROGRESS SINCE THE PRE-SOCRATICS THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN. EXHAUSTED BY THE JUMBLE OF CONCEPTS WE END BY REALIZING THAT OUR LIFE IS STILL LIVED OUT IN THE ELEMENTS OUT OF WHICH THEY CONSTITUTED THE WORLD THAT IT IS THE EARTH FIRE AIR AND WATER WHICH CONDITION US THAT THIS RUDIMENTARY PHYSICS REVEALS THE CONTEXT OF OUR ORDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR TORMENTS. HAVING COMPLICATED THESE FEW ELEMENTARY DATA WE HAVE LOST—FASCINATED BY THE DECOR AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR THEORIES—THE UNDERSTANDING OF DESTINY WHICH NONETHELESS UNCHANGED IS THE SAME AS ON THE WORLD’S FIRST DAY. OUR EXISTENCE REDUCED TO ITS ESSENCE CONTINUES TO BE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ETERNAL ELEMENTS A STRUGGLE WHICH OUR KNOWLEDGE IN NO WAY ALLEVIATES. THE HEROES OF EVERY EPOCH ARE NO LESS WRETCHED THAN THOSE OF HOMER AND IF THEY HAVE BECOME CHARACTERS IT IS BY LOSING VITALITY AND GREATNESS. HOW COULD THE RESULTS OF THE SCIENCES CHANGE MAN’S METAPHYSICAL POSITION? AND WHAT ARE THE EXPLORATIONS OF MATTER THE DISCOVERIES AND THE PRODUCTS OF ANALYSIS BESIDE THE VEDIC HYMNS AND THOSE MELANCHOLIES OF HISTORIC DAWN WHICH CREPT INTO THE WORLD’S ANONYMOUS POETRY?

SINCE THE MOST ELOQUENT DECADENCES EDIFY US NO FURTHER AS TO UNHAPPINESS THAN THE STAMMERINGS OF A SHEPHERD AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS MORE WISDOM IN THE MOCKERY OF AN IDIOT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE LABORATORIES IS IT NOT MADNESS TO PURSUE TRUTH ON THE PATHS OF TIME—OR IN BOOKS? LAO-TSE REDUCED TO A FEW TEXTS IS NOT MORE NAIVE THAN WE WHO HAVE READ EVERYTHING. PROFUNDITY IS INDEPENDENT OF KNOWLEDGE. WE TRANSLATE TO OTHER LEVELS THE REVELATIONS OF THE AGES OR WE EXPLOIT ORIGINAL INTUITIONS BY THE LATEST ACQUISITIONS OF THOUGHT. THUS HEGEL IS A HERACLITUS WHO HAS READ KANT; AND OUR ENNUI IS AN AFFECTIVE ELEATICISM THE FICTION OF DIVERSITY UNMASKED AND EXPOSED TO THE HEART. . . .

SUBTERFUGES
ONLY THOSE WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF ART DRAW THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES. SUICIDE SANCTITY VICE—SO MANY FORMS OF LACK OF TALENT DIRECT OR DISGUISED CONFESSION BY WORD SOUND OR COLOR HALTS THE AGGLOMERATION OF INNER FORCES AND WEAKENS THEM BY PROJECTING THEM BACK TOWARD THE WORLD OUTSIDE. IT IS A SALUTARY DIMINUTION WHICH MAKES EVERY ACT OF CREATION INTO A COEFFICIENT OF ESCAPE. BUT THE MAN WHO ACCUMULATES ENERGIES LIVES UNDER PRESSURE A SLAVE TO HIS OWN EXCESSES; NOTHING KEEPS HIM FROM FOUNDERING IN THE ABSOLUTE. . . .

AUTHENTIC TRAGIC EXISTENCE IS ALMOST NEVER TO BE FOUND AMONG THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THE SECRET POWERS WHICH EXHAUST THEM; DIMINISHING THEIR SOUL BY THEIR WORK WHERE WOULD THEY FIND THE ENERGY TO ATTAIN TO THE EXTREMITY OF ACTIONS? A HERO IS FULFILLED IN A PROUD MODALITY OF DYING BECAUSE HE LACKED THE FACULTY OF GRADUALLY EXTINGUISHING HIMSELF IN VERSE. ALL HEROISM EXPIATES—BY THE GENIUS OF THE HEART—A DEFAULTING TALENT; EVERY HERO IS A BEING WITHOUT TALENT. AND IT IS THIS DEFICIENCY WHICH PROJECTS HIM FORWARD AND ENRICHES HIM WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE BY CREATION IMPOVERISHED THEIR INHERITANCE OF THE UNSPEAKABLE ARE CAST AS EXISTENCES INTO THE BACKGROUND THOUGH THEIR MINDS CAN BE RAISED ABOVE ALL THE REST.

A MAN ELIMINATES HIMSELF FROM THE RANK OF HIS KIND BY THE MONASTERY OR SOME OTHER ARTIFICE—BY MORPHINE MASTURBATION OR RUM—WHEREAS A FORM OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM. BUT ALWAYS PRESENT TO HIMSELF PERFECT POSSESSOR OF HIS RESERVES AND HIS MISTAKES BEARING THE SUM OF HIS LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DIMINISHING IT BY THE PRETEXTS OF ART INVADED BY SELF HE CAN BE ONLY TOTAL IN HIS GESTURES AND HIS RESOLUTIONS HE CAN DRAW ONLY A CONCLUSION AFFECTING HIM ALTOGETHER HE CANNOT RELISH THE EXTREMES; HE IS DROWNED IN THEM; AND HE ACTUALLY DROWNS IN VICE IN GOD OR IN HIS OWN BLOOD WHEREAS THE COWARDICES OF EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE MADE HIM RETREAT BEFORE THE SUPREME. THE MAN WHO EXPRESSES HIMSELF DOES NOT ACT AGAINST HIMSELF; HE KNOWS ONLY THE TEMPTATION OF ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES. AND THE DESERTER IS NOT THE MAN WHO DRAWS THEM BUT THE MAN WHO SCATTERS AND DIVULGES HIMSELF FOR FEAR LEST SURRENDERED TO HIMSELF HE WILL BE RUINED AND WRECKED.

NON-RESISTANCE TO NIGHT
AT FIRST WE THINK WE ADVANCE TOWARD THE LIGHT; THEN WEARIED BY AN AIMLESS MARCH WE LOSE OUR WAY: THE EARTH LESS AND LESS SECURE NO LONGER SUPPORTS US; IT OPENS UNDER OUR FEET. VAINLY WE SHOULD TRY TO FOLLOW A PATH TOWARD A SUNLIT GOAL; THE SHADOWS MOUNT WITHIN AND BELOW US. NO GLEAM TO SLOW OUR DESCENT: THE ABYSS SUMMONS US AND WE LEND AN EAR. ABOVE STILL REMAINS ALL WE WANTED TO BE ALL THAT HAS NOT HAD THE POWER TO RAISE US HIGHER. AND WE ONCE IN LOVE WITH THE PEAKS THEN DISAPPOINTED BY THEM WE END BY FONDLING OUR FALL WE HURRY TO FULFILL IT INSTRUMENTS OF A STRANGE EXECUTION FASCINATED BY THE ILLUSION OF REACHING THE LIMITS OF THE DARKNESS THE FRONTIERS OF OUR NOCTURNAL FATE. FEAR OF THE VOID TRANSFORMED INTO A KIND OF VOLUPTUOUS JOY WHAT LUCK TO GAINSAY THE SUN! INFINITY IN REVERSE GOD THAT BEGINS BENEATH OUR HEELS ECSTASY BEFORE THE CREVICES OF BEING AND THIRST FOR A BLACK HALO THE VOID IS AN INVERTED DREAM IN WHICH WE ARE ENGULFED.

IF DELIRIUM BECOMES OUR LAW LET US WEAR A SUBTERRANEAN NIMBUS A CROWN IN OUR FALL. DETHRONED FROM THIS WORLD LET US CARRY ITS SCEPTER IN ORDER TO HONOR THE NIGHT WITH A NEW SPLENDOR.

(AND YET THIS FALL—BUT FOR SOME MOMENTS OF POSTURING—IS FAR FROM BEING SOLEMN AND LYRIC. HABITUALLY WE SINK INTO A NOCTURNAL MUD INTO A DARKNESS QUITE AS MEDIOCRE AS THE LIGHT. . . . LIFE IS MERELY A TORPOR IN CHIAROSCURO AN INERTIA AMONG THE GLEAMS AND SHADOWS A CARICATURE OF THAT INWARD SUN WHICH MAKES US BELIEVE ILLEGITIMATELY IN OUR EMINENCE OVER THE REST OF MATTER. NOTHING PROVES THAT WE ARE MORE THAN NOTHING. IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THAT CONTINUAL EXPANSION IN WHICH WE RIVAL THE GODS IN WHICH OUR FEVERS TRIUMPH OVER OUR FEARS WE SHOULD HAVE TO REMAIN AT SO HIGH A TEMPERATURE THAT IT WOULD FINISH US OFF IN A FEW DAYS. BUT OUR ILLUMINATIONS ARE INSTANTANEOUS; FALLS ARE OUR RULE. LIFE IS WHAT DECOMPOSES AT EVERY MOMENT; IT IS A MONOTONOUS LOSS OF LIGHT AN INSIPID DISSOLUTION IN THE DARKNESS WITHOUT SCEPTERS WITHOUT HALOS. . . .)

TURNING A COLD SHOULDER TO TIME
    YESTERDAY TODAY TOMORROW—THESE ARE SERVANTS' CATEGORIES. FOR THE IDLE MAN SUMPTUOUSLY SETTLED IN THE INCONSOLABLE AND WHOM EVERY MOMENT TORMENTS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE ARE MERELY VARIABLE APPEARANCES OF ONE AND THE SAME DISEASE IDENTICAL IN ITS SUBSTANCE INEXORABLE IN ITS INSINUATION AND MONOTONOUS IN ITS PERSISTENCE AND THIS DISEASE IS COEXTENSIVE WITH BEING—IT IS BEING.

    I WAS I AM OR I SHALL BE—A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR AND NOT OF EXISTENCE. FATE—AS A CARNIVAL OF CHRONOS—LENDS ITSELF TO CONJUGATION BUT STRIPPED OF ITS MASKS IS REVEALED TO BE AS MOTIONLESS AND NAKED AS AN EPITAPH. HOW CAN WE GRANT MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE HOUR WHICH IS THAN TO THE ONE WHICH WAS OR WHICH WILL BE? THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH SERVANTS LIVE— AND EVERY MAN WHO ADHERES TO TIME IS A SERVANT'— REPRESENTS A TRUE STATE OF GRACE AN ENCHANTED OBSCURATION; AND THIS CONTEMPT—LIKE A SUPERNATURAL VEIL—COVERS THE DAMNATION TO WHICH EVERY ACTION ENGENDERED BY DESIRE IS EXPOSED. BUT FOR THE DISABUSED MAN OF LEISURE THE PURE FACT OF LIVING LIVING PURE OF ALL PRAXIS IS A TASK SO WEARYING THAT TO ENDURE EXISTENCE AS SUCH SEEMS TO HIM AN EXCESSIVE OCCUPATION AN EXHAUSTING CAREER—AND 'EVERY GESTURE INORDINATE IMPRACTICABLE AND REPEALED.

TWO-FACED FREEDOM
THOUGH THE PROBLEM OF FREEDOM IS INSOLUBLE WE CAN ALWAYS ARGUE ABOUT IT ALWAYS SIDE WITH CONTINGENCY OR NECESSITY. . . . OUR TEMPERAMENTS AND OUR PREJUDICES FACILITATE AN OPTION WHICH CUTS SHORT AND SIMPLIFIES THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SOLVING IT. WHEREAS NO THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION MANAGES TO MAKE IT APPARENT TO US TO MAKE US EXPERIENCE ITS DENSE AND CONTRADICTORY REALITY A PRIVILEGED INTUITION PUTS US AT THE VERY HEART OF FREEDOM DESPITE ALL THE ARGUMENTS INVENTED AGAINST IT. AND WE ARE AFRAID; WE ARE AFRAID OF THE ENORMITY OF THE POSSIBLE NOT BEING PREPARED FOR A REVELATION SO HUGE AND SO SUDDEN FOR THAT DANGEROUS BENEFIT TO WHICH WE ASPIRED AND BEFORE WHICH WE RETREAT. WHAT SHALL WE DO—ACCUSTOMED TO CHAINS AND LAWS—-IN THE FACE OF AN INFINITY OF INITIATIVES OF A DEBAUCH OF DECISIONS? THE SEDUCTION OF THE ARBITRARY ALARMS US. IF WE CAN BEGIN ANY ACTION IF THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO INSPIRATION AND TO OUR WHIMS HOW AVOID OUR RUIN IN THE INTOXICATION OF SO MUCH POWER?

CONSCIOUSNESS SHAKEN BY THIS REVELATION INTERROGATES ITSELF AND TREMBLES. WHO IN A WORLD WHERE HE CAN DO ANYTHING HAS NOT BEEN DIZZIED? THE MURDERER MAKES A IIMITLESS USE OF HIS FREEDOM AND CANNOT RESIST THE NOTION OF HIS POWER. IT IS WITHIN THE CAPACITIES OF EACH ONE OF US TO TAKE ANOTHER’S LIFE. IF ALL THOSE WE HAVE KILLED IN THOUGHT WERE TO DISAPPEAR FOR GOOD THE EARTH WOULD BE DEPOPULATED. WE BEAR WITHIN US A RETICENT EXECUTIONER AN UNREALIZED CRIMINAL. AND THOSE WHO LACK THE BOLDNESS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES MURDER IN DREAMS PEOPLE THEIR NIGHTMARES WITH CORPSES. BEFORE AN ABSOLUTE TRIBUNAL ONLY THE ANGELS WOULD BE ACQUITTED. FOR THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS NOT—AT LEAST UNCONSCIOUSLY—DESIRED THE DEATH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. EACH OF US DRAGS AFTER HIM A CEMETERY OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES; AND IT MATTERS LITTLE WHETHER THIS GRAVEYARD IS RELEGATED TO THE HEART’S ABYSS OR PROJECTED TO THE SURFACE OF OUR DESIRES.

FREEDOM CONCEIVED IN ITS ULTIMATE IMPLICATIONS RAISES THE QUESTION OF OUR LIFE OR OF OTHERS' LIVES; IT INVOLVES THE DUAL POSSIBILITY OF SAVING OR DESTROYING US. BUT WE FEEL FREE WE UNDERSTAND OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR DANGERS ONLY BY FITS AND STARTS. AND IT IS THE INTERMITTENCE OF THESE FITS AND STARTS THEIR RARITY WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THIS WORLD IS NO MORE THAN A MEDIOCRE SLAUGHTERHOUSE AND A ACTIVE PARADISE. TO ARGUE ABOUT FREEDOM LEADS TO NO CONSEQUENCE IN GOOD OR EVIL; BUT WE HAVE ONLY MOMENTS TO REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON US. . . . FREEDOM IS AN ETHICAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMONIC ESSENCE.

OVERWORKED BY DREAMS
IF WE COULD CONSERVE THE ENERGY WE LAVISH IN THAT SERIES OF DREAMS WE NIGHTLY LEAVE BEHIND US THE MIND’S DEPTH AND SUBTLETY WOULD REACH UNIMAGINABLE PROPORTIONS. THE SCAFFOLDING OF A NIGHTMARE REQUIRES A NERVOUS EXPENDITURE MORE EXHAUSTING THAN THE BEST ARTICULATED THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION. HOW AFTER WAKING BEGIN AGAIN THE TASK OF ALIGNING IDEAS WHEN IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS WE WERE MIXED UP WITH GROTESQUE AND MARVELOUS SPECTACLES WE WERE SAILING AMONG THE SPHERES WITHOUT THE SHACKLES OF ANTI-POETIC CAUSALITY? FOR HOURS WE WERE LIKE DRUNKEN GODS—AND SUDDENLY OUR OPEN EYES ERASING NIGHT’S INFINITY WE MUST RESUME IN DAY’S MEDIOCRITY THE ENTERPRISE OF INSIPID PROBLEMS WITHOUT ANY OF THE NIGHT’S HALLUCINATIONS TO HELP US. THE GLORIOUS AND DEADLY FANTASY WAS ALL FOR NOTHING THEN; SLEEP HAS EXHAUSTED US IN VAIN. WAKING ANOTHER KIND OF WEARINESS AWAITS US; AFTER HAVING HAD JUST TIME ENOUGH TO FORGET THE NIGHT’S WE ARE AT GRIPS WITH THE DAWN’S. WE HAVE LABORED HOURS AND HOURS IN HORIZONTAL IMMOBILITY WITHOUT OUR BRAIN’S DERIVING THE LEAST ADVANTAGE OF ITS ABSURD ACTIVITY. AN IMBECILE WHO WAS NOT VICTIMIZED BY THIS WASTE WHO MIGHT ACCUMULATE ALL HIS RESOURCES WITHOUT DISSIPATING THEM IN DREAMS WOULD BE ABLE—OWNER OF AN IDEAL STATE OF WAKING—TO DISENTANGLE ALL THE SNAGS OF THE METAPHYSICAL LIES OR INITIATE HIMSELF INTO THE MOST INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES OF MATHEMATICS.

AFTER EACH NIGHT WE ARE EMPTIER: OUR MYSTERIES AND OUR GRIEFS HAVE LEAKED AWAY INTO OUR DREAMS. THUS SLEEP’S LABOR NOT ONLY DIMINISHES THE POWER OF OUR THOUGHT BUT EVEN THAT OF OUR SECRETS. . . .

THE MODEL TRAITOR
SINCE LIFE CAN BE FULFILLED ONLY WITHIN INDIVIDUATION—THAT LAST BASTION OF SOLITUDE—EACH BEING IS NECESSARY ALONE BY THE FACT THAT HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL. YET ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ALONE IN THE SAME WAY NOR WITH THE SAME INTENSITY: EACH OCCUPIES A DIFFERENT RANK IN THE HIERARCHY OF SOLITUDE; AT ONE EXTREME STANDS THE TRAITOR: HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE POINT OF EXASPERATION. IN THIS SENSE JUDAS IS THE LONELIEST BEING IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY BUT NOT IN THE HISTORY OF SOLITUDE. HE BETRAYED ONLY A GOD; HE KNEW WHAT HE BETRAYED; HE BETRAYED SOMEONE AS SO MANY OTHERS BETRAY SOMETHING: A COUNTRY OR OTHER MORE OR LESS COLLECTIVE PRETEXTS. THE BETRAYAL WHICH FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC OBJECT EVEN IF IT INVOLVES DISHONOR OR DEATH IS NOT AT ALL MYSTERIOUS: WE ALWAYS HAVE THE IMAGE OF WHAT WE WANT TO DESTROY; GUILT IS CLEAR WHETHER ADMITTED OR DENIED. THE OTHERS CAST YOU OUT AND YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE CELL OR THE GUILLOTINE. . . .

BUT THERE EXISTS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX MODALITY OF BETRAYAL WITHOUT IMMEDIATE REFERENCE WITHOUT RELATION TO AN OBJECT OR A PERSON. THUS: TO ABANDON EVERYTHING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THIS EVERYTHING REPRESENTS; TO ISOLATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR MILIEU; TO REJECT—BY A METAPHYSICAL DIVORCE—THE SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS MOLDED YOU WHICH SURROUNDS YOU AND WHICH CARRIES YOU.

WHO AND BY WHAT DEFIANCE CAN CHALLENGE EXISTENCE WITH IMPUNITY? WHO AND BY WHAT EFFORTS CAN ACHIEVE A LIQUIDATION OF THE VERY PRINCIPLE OF HIS OWN BREATH? YET THE WILL TO UNDERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THAT EXISTS PRODUCES A CRAVING FOR NEGATIVE EFFECTIVENESS POWERFUL AND INEFFABLE AS A WHIFF OF REMORSE CORRUPTING THE YOUNG VITALITY OF A HOPE. . .

WHEN YOU HAVE BETRAYED BEING YOU BEAR WITH YOU ONLY A VAGUE DISCOMFORT; THERE IS NO IMAGE SUSTAINING THE OBJECT WHICH PROVOKES THE SENSATION OF INFAMY. NO ONE CASTS THE FIRST STONE; YOU ARE A RESPECTABLE CITIZEN AS BEFORE; YOU ENJOY THE HONORS OF THE CITY THE CONSIDERATION OF YOUR KIND; THE LAWS PROTECT YOU; YOU ARE AS ESTIMABLE AS ANYONE ELSE-—AND YET NO ONE SEES THAT YOU ARE LIVING YOUR FUNERAL IN ADVANCE AND THAT YOUR DEATH CAN ADD NOTHING TO YOUR IRREMEDIABLY ESTABLISHED CONDITION THIS IS BECAUSE THE TRAITOR TO EXISTENCE IS ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO HIMSELF. WHO ELSE CAN ASK HIM FOR AN ACCOUNTING? IF YOU DENOUNCE NEITHER A MAN NOR AN INSTITUTION YOU RUN NO RISK; NO LAW PROTECTS REALITY BUT ALL OF THEM PUNISH YOU FOR THE MEREST PREJUDICE AGAINST ITS APPEARANCES. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO SAP BEING ITSELF BUT NO HUMAN BEING; YOU MAY LEGALLY DEMOLISH THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THAT IS BUT PRISON OR DEATH AWAITS YOUR LEAST INFRINGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POWERS. NOTHING PROTECTS EXISTENCE: THERE IS NO CASE AGAINST METAPHYSICAL TRAITORS AGAINST THE BUDDHAS WHO REJECT SALVATION FOR WE JUDGE THEM TRAITORS ONLY TO THEIR OWN LIVES. YET OF ALL MALEFACTORS THESE ARE THE MOST HARMFUL: THEY DO NOT ATTACK THE FRUIT BUT THE VERY SAP OF THE UNIVERSE. THEIR PUNISHMENT? THEY ALONE KNOW WHAT IT IS. . . .

IT MAY BE THAT IN EVERY TRAITOR THERE IS A THIRST FOR OPPROBRIUM AND THAT HIS CHOICE OF BETRAYAL DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE OF SOLITUDE HE ASPIRES TO. WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THE DESIRE TO PERPETRATE AN INCOMPARABLE CRIME WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE HIM FROM THE HUMAN RACE? WHO HAS NOT COVETED IGNOMINY IN ORDER TO SEVER FOR GOOD THE LINKS WHICH ATTACH HIM TO OTHERS TO SUFFER A CONDEMNATION WITHOUT APPEAL AND THEREBY TO REACH THE PEACE OF THE ABYSS? AND WHEN WE BREAK WITH THE UNIVERSE IS IT NOT FOR THE CALM OF AN UNPARDONABLE CRIME? A JUDAS WITH THE SOUL OF A BUDDHA—WHAT A MODEL FOR A COMING AND CONCLUDING HUMANITY!

IN ONE OF THE EARTH’S ATTICS
“I HAVE DREAMED OF DISTANT SPRINGS OF A SUN SHINING ON NOTHING BUT SEAFOAM AND THE OBLIVION OF MY BIRTH OF A SUN OPPOSED TO THE EARTH AND TO THIS DISEASE OF FINDING NOTHING ANYWHERE BUT THE DESIRE TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE THE EARTHLY FATE—-WHO HAS INFLICTED IT UPON US WHO HAS CHAINED US TO THIS MOROSE MATTER A PETRIFIED TEAR AGAINST WHICH-—BORN OF TIME—OUR TEARS SHATTER WHEREAS IT HAS FALLEN IMMEMORIAL FROM GOD’S FIRST SHUDDER?

“I HAVE LOATHED THE PLANET’S NOONS AND MIDNIGHTS I HAVE LONGED FOR A WORLD WITHOUT WEATHER WITHOUT HOURS AND THE FEAR THAT SWELLS THEM I HAVE HATED THE SIGHS OF MORTALS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF AGES. WHERE IS THE MOMENT WITHOUT END AND WITHOUT DESIRE AND THAT PRIMAL VACANCY INSENSITIVE TO THE PRESENTIMENTS OF DISASTER AND OF LIFE? I HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE GEOGRAPHY OF NOTHINGNESS OF UNKNOWN SEAS AND ANOTHER SUN—PURE OF THE SCANDAL OF LIFE-BEARING RAYS—1 HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE ROCKING OF A SKEPTICAL OCEAN IN WHICH ISLANDS AND AXIOMS ARE DROWNED THE VAST LIQUID NARCOTIC TEPID AND SWEET AND TIRED OF KNOWLEDGE. . . .

“THIS EARTH—-SIN OF THE CREATOR! BET I NO LONGER WANT TO EXPIATE OTHERS' SINS. I WANT TO BE CURED OF MY BEGETTING IN AN AGONY OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTS IN SOME FLUID DESERT IN AN IMPERSONAL SHIPWRECK.”

INDEFINITE HORROR
IT IS NOT THE OUTBREAK OF A SPECIFIC EVIL WHICH REMINDS US OF OUR FRAGILITY: THERE ARE VAGUER BUT MORE TROUBLESOME WARNINGS TO SIGNIFY OUR IMMINENT EXCOMMUNICATION FROM THE TEMPORAL THE APPROACH OF DISGUST OF THAT SENSATION WHICH PHYSIOLOGICALLY SEPARATES US FROM THE WORLD SHOWS HOW DESTRUCTIBLE IS THE SOLIDITY OF OUR INSTINCTS OR THE CONSISTENCY OF OUR ATTACHMENTS. IN HEALTH OUR FLESH ECHOES THE UNIVERSAL PULSATION AND OUR BLOOD REPRODUCES ITS CADENCE; IN DISGUST WHICH LIES IN WAIT FOR US LIKE A POTENTIAL HELL IN ORDER TO SUDDENLY SEIZE UPON US AFTERWARDS WE ARE AS ISOLATED IN THE WHOLE AS A MONSTER IMAGINED BY SOME TERATOLOGY OF SOLITUDE.

THE CRITICAL POINT OF OUR VITALITY IS NOT DISEASE—WHICH IS STRUGGLE—BUT THAT INDEFINITE HORROR WHICH REJECTS EVERYTHING AND STRIPS OUR DESIRES OF THE POWER TO PROCREATE NEW MISTAKES. THE SENSES LOSE THEIR SAP THE VEINS DRY UP AND THE ORGANS NO LONGER PERCEIVE ANYTHING BUT THE INTERVAL SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR OWN FUNCTIONS. EVERYTHING TURNS INSIPID: PROVENDER AND DREAMS. NO MORE AROMA IN MATTER AND NO MORE ENIGMA IN MEDITATION; GASTRONOMY AND METAPHYSICS BOTH BECOME VICTIMS OF OUR WANT OF APPETITE. WE SPEND HOURS WAITING FOR OTHER HOURS WAITING FOR THE MOMENTS WHICH NO LONGER FLEE TIME THE FAITHFUL MOMENTS WHICH REINSTATE US IN THE MEDIOCRITY OF HEALTH . . . AND THE AMNESIA OF ITS DANGERS.

(GREED FOR SPACE UNCONSCIOUS COVETOUSNESS OF THE FUTURE HEALTH SHOWS US HOW SUPERFICIAL THE LEVEL OF LIFE IS AS SUCH AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE ORGANIC EQUILIBRIUM IS WITH INNER DEPTH.

THE MIND IN ITS RANGE PROCEEDS FROM OUR COMPROMISED FUNCTIONS: IT TAKES WING INSOFAR AS THE VOID DILATES WITHIN OUR ORGANS. WE ARE HEALTHY ONLY INSOFAR AS WE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY OURSELVES: IT IS OUR DISGUSTS WHICH INDIVIDUALIZE US; OUR MELANCHOLIES WHICH GRANT US A NAME; OUR LOSSES WHICH MAKE US POSSESSORS OF OUR . . . SELF. WE ARE OURSELVES ONLY BY THE SUM OF OUR FAILURES.)

UNCONSCIOUS DOGMAS
WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PENETRATE SOMEONE’S MISTAKE TO SHOW HIM THE INANITY OF HIS PLANS AND INTENTIONS; BUT HOW WREST HIM FROM HIS PERSISTENCE IN TIME WHEN HE CONCEALS A FANATICISM AS INVETERATE AS HIS INSTINCTS AS OLD AS HIS PREJUDICES? WE BEAR WITHIN US—LIKE AN UNCHALLENGEABLE TREASURE—AN AMALGAM OF UNWORTHY BELIEFS AND CERTITUDES. AND EVEN THE MAN WHO MANAGES TO RID HIMSELF OF THEM TO VANQUISH THEM REMAINS—IN THE DESERT OF HIS LUCIDITY—A FANATIC STILL: A FANATIC OF HIMSELF OF HIS OWN EXISTENCE; HE HAS SCOURED ALL HIS OBSESSIONS EXCEPT FOR THE TERRAIN WHERE THEY FLOURISH; HE HAS LOST ALL HIS FIXED POINTS EXCEPT FOR THE FIXITY FROM WHICH THEY PROCEED. LIFE HAS DOGMAS MORE IMMUTABLE THAN THEOLOGY EACH EXISTENCE BEING ANCHORED IN INFALLIBILITIES WHICH EXCEED ALL THE LUCUBRATIONS OF MADNESS OR OF FAITH. EVEN THE SKEPTIC IN LOVE WITH HIS DOUBTS TURNS OUT TO BE A FANATIC OF SKEPTICISM. MAN IS THE DOGMATIC BEING PAR EXCELLENCE; AND HIS DOGMAS ARE ALL THE DEEPER WHEN HE DOES NOT FORMULATE THEM WHEN HE IS UNAWARE OF THEM AND WHEN HE FOLLOWS THEM.

WE ALL BELIEVE IN MANY MORE THINGS THAN WE THINK WE HARBOR INTOLERANCES WE CHERISH BLOODY PREJUDICES AND DEFENDING OUR IDEAS WITH EXTREME MEANS WE TRAVEL THE WORLD LIKE AMBULATORY AND IRREFRAGABLE FORTRESSES. EACH OF US IS A SUPREME DOGMA TO HIMSELF; NO THEOLOGY PROTECTS ITS GOD AS WE PROTECT OUR SELF; AND IF WE ASSAIL THIS SELF WITH DOUBTS AND CALL IT INTO QUESTION WE DO SO ONLY BY A PSEUDO-ELEGANCE OF OUR PRIDE: THE CASE IS ALREADY WON.

HOW ESCAPE THE ABSOLUTE OF ONESELF? ONE WOULD HAVE TO IMAGINE A BEING WITHOUT INSTINCTS WITHOUT A NAME AND TO WHOM HIS OWN IMAGE WOULD BE UNKNOWN. BUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD GIVES US BACK OUR OWN FEATURES; NIGHT ITSELF IS NEVER DARK ENOUGH TO KEEP US FROM BEING REFLECTED IN IT. TOO PRESENT TO OURSELVES OUR NON-EXISTENCE BEFORE BIRTH AND AFTER DEATH INFLUENCES US ONLY AS A NOTION AND ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS; WE EXPERIENCE THE FEVER OF OUR DURATION AS AN ETERNITY WHICH FALTERS BUT WHICH NONETHELESS REMAINS UNEXHAUSTIBLE IN ITS PRINCIPLE.

THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ADORE HIMSELF IS YET TO BE BORN. EVERYTHING THAT LIVES LOVES ITSELF; IF NOT WHAT WOULD BE THE SOURCE OF THE DREAD WHICH BREAKS OUT IN THE DEPTHS AND ON THE SURFACES OF LIFE? EACH OF US IS FOR HIMSELF THE ONE FIXED POINT IN THE UNIVERSE. AND IF SOMEONE DIES FOR AN IDEA IT IS BECAUSE IT IS HIS IDEA AND HIS IDEA IS HIS LIFE.

NO CRITIQUE OF ANY KIND OF REASON WILL WAKEN MAN FROM HIS “DOGMATIC SLEEP.” IT MAY SHAKE THE UNCONSCIOUS CERTITUDES WHICH ABOUND IN HIS PHILOSOPHY AND SUBSTITUTE MORE FLEXIBLE PROPOSITIONS FOR HIS RIGID AFFIRMATIONS BUT HOW BY A RATIONAL PROCEDURE WILL IT MANAGE TO SHAKE THE CREATURE HUDDLED OVER ITS OWN DOGMAS WITHOUT BRINGING ABOUT ITS VERY DEATH?

DUALITY
THERE IS A VULGARITY WHICH MAKES US ADMIT ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD BUT WHICH IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE US ADMIT THIS WORLD ITSELF HENCE WE CAN ENDURE LIFE’S MISERIES EVEN AS WE REPUDIATE LIFE LET OURSELVES BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE FRENZIES OF DESIRE EVEN AS WE REJECT DESIRE. IN THE ASSENT TO EXISTENCE THERE IS A KIND OF BASENESS WHICH WE ESCAPE BY MEANS OF OUR PRIDES AND OUR REGRETS BUT PARTICULARLY BY MEANS OF THE MELANCHOLY WHICH KEEPS US FROM SLIDING INTO A FINAL AFFIRMATION WRESTED FROM OUR COWARDICE. IS ANYTHING VILER THAN TO SAY YES TO THE WORLD? AND YET WE KEEP MULTIPLYING THAT CONSENT THAT TRIVIAL REPETITION THAT LOYALTY OATH TO LIFE DENIED ONLY BY EVERYTHING IN US THAT REJECTS VULGARITY.

WE CAN LIVE THE WAY THE OTHERS DO AND YET CONCEAL A ' W GREATER THAN THE WORLD: THAT IS MELANCHOLY’S INFINITY. . . .

(WE CAN LOVE ONLY THE BEINGS WHO DO NOT EXCEED THE MINIMUM OF VULGARITY INDISPENSABLE FOR LIFE ITSELF. YET IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DELIMIT THE QUANTITY OF SUCH VULGARITY ESPECIALLY SINCE NO ACTION CAN DO WITHOUT IT. ALL OF LIFE’S REJECTS PROVE THAT THEY WERE INSUFFICIENTLY SORDID. . . . THE MAN WHO PREVAILS IN THE CONFLICT WITH HIS NEIGHBORS STANDS ON TOP OF A DUNGHEAP; AND THE MAN WHO IS VANQUISHED THERE PAYS FOR A PURITY HE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO SULLY. IN EVERY MAN NOTHING IS MORE ALIVE AND TRUE THAN HIS OWN VULGARITY SOURCE OF ALL THAT IS VITAL IN ELEMENTAL TERMS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE MORE DEEPLY ROOTED YOU ARE IN LIFE THE MORE CONTEMPTIBLE YOU ARE. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT SPREAD A VAGUE FUNEREAL RADIATION AROUND HIMSELF AND WHO IN PASSING FAILS TO LEAVE A WHIFF OF MELANCHOLY FROM REMOTE WORLDS—THAT MAN BELONGS TO SUB-ZOOLOGY MORE SPECIFICALLY TO HUMAN HISTORY.

THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN VULGARITY AND MELANCHOLY IS SO IRREDUCIBLE THAT NEXT TO IT ALL OTHER OPPOSITIONS SEEM TO BE INVENTIONS OF THE MIND ARBITRARY AND ENTERTAINING; EVEN THE MOST DECISIVE ANTIMONIES BLUR BESIDE THIS OPPOSITION IN WHICH ARE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE—ACCORDING TO A PREDESTINED DOSAGE—OUR LOWER DEPTHS AND OUR DREAMING GALL.)

THE RENEGADE
HE REMEMBERS BEING BORN SOMEWHERE HAVING BELIEVED IN NATIVE ERRORS HAVING PROPOSED PRINCIPLES AND PREACHED INFLAMMATORY STUPIDITIES. HE BLUSHES FOR IT . . . AND STRIVES TO ABJURE HIS PAST HIS REAL OR IMAGINARY FATHERLANDS THE TRUTHS GENERATED IN HIS VERY MARROW. HE WILL FIND PEACE ONLY AFTER HAVING ANNIHILATED IN HIMSELF THE LAST REFLEX OF THE CITIZEN THE LAST INHERITED ENTHUSIASM. HOW COULD THE HEART’S HABITS STILL CHAIN HIM WHEN HE SEEKS LIBERATION FROM GENEALOGIES AND WHEN EVEN THE IDEAL OF THE ANCIENT SAGE SCORNER OF ALL CITIES SEEMS TO HIM A COMPROMISE? THE MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER TAKE SIDES BECAUSE ALL MEN ARE NECESSARILY RIGHT AND WRONG BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS AT ONCE JUSTIFIED AND IRRATIONAL-—THAT MAN MUST RENOUNCE HIS OWN NAME TREAD HIS IDENTITY UNDERFOOT AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE IN IMPASSIBILITY OR DESPAIR. OR OTHERWISE INVENT ANOTHER GENRE OF SOLITUDE EXPATRIATE HIMSELF IN THE VOID AND PURSUE—BY MEANS OF ONE EXILE OR ANOTHER—THE STAGES OF UPROOTEDNESS. RELEASED FROM ALL PREJUDICES HE BECOMES THE UNUSABLE MAN PAR EXCELLENCE TO WHOM NO ONE TURNS AND WHOM NO ONE FEARS BECAUSE HE ADMITS AND REPUDIATES EVERYTHING WITH THE SAME DETACHMENT. LESS DANGEROUS THAN A HEEDLESS INSECT HE IS NONETHELESS A SCOURGE FOR LIFE FOR IT HAS VANISHED FROM HIS VOCABULARY WITH THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE CREATION. AND LIFE WOULD FORGIVE HIM IF AT LEAST HE RELISHED CHAOS WHICH IS WHERE LIFE BEGAN. BUT HE DENIES THE FEVERISH ORIGINS BEGINNING WITH HIS OWN AND PRESERVES WITH REGARD TO THE WORLD ONLY A COLD MEMORY A POLITE REGRET.

(FROM DENIAL TO DENIAL HIS EXISTENCE IS DIMINISHED: VAGUER AND MORE UNREAL THAN A SYLLOGISM OF SIGHS HOW COULD HE STILL BE A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD? ANEMIC HE RIVALS THE IDEA ITSELF; HE HAS ABSTRACTED HIMSELF FROM HIS ANCESTORS FROM HIS FRIENDS FROM EVERY SOUL AND HIMSELF; IN HIS VEINS ONCE TURBULENT RESTS A LIGHT FROM ANOTHER WORLD. LIBERATED FROM WHAT HE HAS LIVED UNCONCERNED BY WHAT HE WILL LIVE HE DEMOLISHES THE SIGNPOSTS ON ALL HIS ROADS AND WRESTS HIMSELF FROM THE DIALS OF ALL TIME. “I SHALL NEVER MEET MYSELF AGAIN” HE DECIDES HAPPY TO TURN HIS LAST HATRED AGAINST HIMSELF HAPPIER STILL TO ANNIHILATE—IN HIS FORGIVENESS— ALL BEINGS ALL THINGS.)

SHADES OF THE FUTURE
WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN IMAGINING A TIME WHEN WE SHALL HAVE TRANSCENDED EVERYTHING EVEN MUSIC EVEN POETRY A TIME WHEN DETRACTORS OF OUR TRADITIONS AND OUR TRANSPORTS WE SHALL ACHIEVE SUCH A DISAVOWAL OF OURSELVES THAT WEARY OF A KNOWN GRAVE WE SHALL MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THE DAYS IN A THREADBARE SHROUD. WHEN A SONNET WHOSE RIGOR RAISES THE VERBAL WORLD ABOVE A SPLENDIDLY IMAGINED COSMOS—WHEN A SONNET CEASES TO BE A TEMPTATION FOR OUR TEARS AND WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONATA OUR YAWNS WIN OUT OVER OUR EMOTION THEN THE GRAVEYARDS WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH US FOR THEY RECEIVE ONLY FRESH CORPSES STILL IMBUED WITH A SUSPICION OF WARMTH AND A MEMORY OF LIFE.

BEFORE OUR OLD AGE A TIME WILL COME WHEN RETRACING OUR ARDORS AND BENT BENEATH THE RECANTATIONS OF THE FLESH WE SHALL WALK HALF-CARRION HALF-SPECTER. . . . WE SHALL HAVE REPRESSED—OUT OF FEAR OF COMPLICITY WITH ILLUSION—ANY PALPITATION WITHIN US. UNABLE TO HAVE DISEMBODIED OUR LIFE IN A SONNET WE SHALL DRAG OUR CORRUPTION IN SHREDS AND TATTERS AND FOR HAVING OUTSTRIPPED MUSIC AND DEATH ALIKE WE SHALL STUMBLE BLIND TOWARD A FUNEREAL IMMORTALITY. . . .

THE FLOWER OF FIXED IDEAS
SO LONG AS MAN IS PROTECTED BY MADNESS HE FUNCTIONS AND FLOURISHES; BUT WHEN HE FREES HIMSELF FROM THE FRUITFUL TYRANNY OF FIXED IDEAS HE IS LOST RUINED. HE BEGINS TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING TO WRAP NOT ONLY MINOR ABUSES IN HIS TOLERANCE BUT CRIMES AND MONSTROSITIES VICES AND ABERRATIONS: EVERYTHING IS WORTH THE SAME TO HIM. HIS INDULGENCE SELF-DESTROYING AS IT IS EXTENDS TO ALL THE GUILTY TO THE VICTIMS AND THE EXECUTIONERS; HE TAKES ALL SIDES BECAUSE HE ESPOUSES ALL OPINIONS; GELATINOUS CONTAMINATED BY INFINITY HE HAS LOST HIS “CHARACTER” LACKING ANY POINT OF REFERENCE ANY OBSESSION. THE UNIVERSAL VIEW MELTS THINGS INTO A BLUR AND THE MAN WHO STILL MAKES THEM OUT BEING NEITHER THEIR FRIEND NOR THEIR ENEMY BEARS IN HIMSELF A WAX HEART WHICH INDISCRIMINATELY TAKES THE FORM OF OBJECTS AND BEINGS. HIS PITY IS ADDRESSED TO . . . EXISTENCE AND HIS CHARITY IS THAT OF DOUBT AND NOT THAT OF LOVE; A SKEPTICAL CHARITY CONSEQUENCE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH EXCUSES ALL ANOMALIES. BUT THE MAN WHO TAKES SIDES WHO LIVES IN THE FOLLY OF DECISION AND CHOICE IS NEVER CHARITABLE; INCAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING ALL POINTS OF VIEW CONFINED IN THE HORIZON OF HIS DESIRES AND HIS PRINCIPLES HE PLUNGES INTO A HYPNOSIS OF THE FINITE. THIS IS BECAUSE CREATURES FLOURISH ONLY BY TURNING THEIR BACKS ON THE UNIVERSAL . . . TO BE SOMETHING—UNCONDITIONAL—-IS ALWAYS A FORM OF MADNESS FROM WHICH LIFE—FLOWER OF FIXED IDEA—FREES ITSELF ONLY TO FADE.

THE “CELESTIAL DOG”
UNKNOWABLE WHAT A MAN MUST LOSE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT THE CONVENTIONS—UNKNOWABLE WHAT DIOGENES LOST TO BECOME THE MAN WHO PERMITTED HIMSELF EVERYTHING WHO TRANSLATED HIS INNERMOST THOUGHTS INTO ACTIONS WITH A SUPERNATURAL INSOLENCE LIKE SOME LIBIDINOUS YET PURE GOD OF KNOWLEDGE. NO ONE WAS SO FRANK; A LIMIT CASE OF SINCERITY AND LUCIDITY AS WELL AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD BE IF EDUCATION AND HYPOCRISY DID NOT REIN IN OUR DESIRES AND OUR GESTURES.

“ONE DAY A MAN INVITED HIM INTO A RICHLY FURNISHED HOUSE SAYING 'BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPIT ON THE FLOOR.' DIOGENES WHO NEEDED TO SPIT SPAT IN HIS FACE EXCLAIMING THAT IT WAS THE ONLY DIRTY PLACE HE COULD FIND WHERE SPITTING WAS PERMITTED."—DIOGENES LAÈRTIUS.

WHO AFTER BEING RECEIVED BY A RICH MAN HAS NOT LONGED OCEANS OF SALIVA TO EXPECTORATE ON ALL THE OWNERS OF THE EARTH? AND WHO HAS NOT SWALLOWED HIS OWN SPITTLE FOR FEAR OF CASTING IT IN THE FACE OF SOME STOUT AND RESPECTED THIEF?

WE ARE ALL ABSURDLY PRUDENT AND TIMID: CYNICISM IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL. NOR IS PRIDE.

“MENIPPUS IN HIS WORK ENTITLED THE VIRTUE OF DIOGENES TELLS HOW HE WAS CAPTURED AND SOLD AS A SLAVE AND THAT HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE KNEW HOW TO DO. DIOGENES ANSWERED: 'COMMAND!' AND SHOUTED TO THE HERALD: 'ASK WHO WANTS TO BUY A MASTER.'”

THE MAN WHO AFFRONTED ALEXANDER AND PLATO WHO MASTURBATED IN THE MARKETPLACE ("IF ONLY HEAVEN LET US RUB OUR BELLIES TOO AND THAT BE ENOUGH TO STAVE OFF HUNGER!") THE MAN OF THE FAMOUS CASK AND THE FAMOUS LANTERN AND WHO IN HIS YOUTH WAS A COUNTERFEITER (WHAT HIGHER DIGNITY FOR A CYNIC?) WHAT MUST HIS EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN OF HIS NEIGHBORS? CERTAINLY OUR OWN YET WITH THIS DIFFERENCE: THAT MAN WAS THE SOLE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REFLECTION AND HIS CONTEMPT. WITHOUT SUFFERING THE FALSIFICATIONS OF ANY ETHIC AND ANY METAPHYSIC HE STROVE TO STRIP MAN IN ORDER TO SHOW HIM TO US NAKEDER AND MORE ABOMINABLE THAN ANY COMEDY ANY APOCALYPSE HAS DONE.

“SOCRATES GONE MAD” PLATO CALLED HIM—SOCRATES TURNED SINCERE IS WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE SAID SOCRATES RENOUNCING THE GOOD ABJURING FORMULAS AND THE CITY SOCRATES TURNING FINALLY INTO A PSYCHOLOGIST AND NOTHING MORE. BUT SOCRATES—EVEN SUBLIME—REMAINS CONVENTIONAL; HE REMAINS A MASTER AN EDIFYING MODEL ONLY DIOGENES PROPOSES NOTHING; THE BASIS OF HIS ATTITUDE—AND OF CYNICISM IN ITS ESSENCE—IS DETERMINED BY A TESTICULAR HORROR OF THE ABSURDITY OF BEING MAN.

THE THINKER WHO REFLECTS WITHOUT ILLUSION UPON HUMAN REALITY IF HE WANTS TO REMAIN WITHIN THE WORLD AND IF HE ELIMINATES MYSTICISM AS AN ESCAPE-HATCH ENDS UP WITH A VISION IN WHICH ARE MINGLED WISDOM BITTERNESS AND FARCE; AND IF HE CHOOSES THE MARKETPLACE AS THE SITE OF HIS SOLITUDE HE MUSTERS HIS VERVE IN MOCKING HIS “KIND” OR IN EXHIBITING HIS DISGUST A DISGUST WHICH TODAY WITH CHRISTIANITY AND THE POLICE WE CAN NO LONGER PERMIT OURSELVES. TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF OATHS AND CODES HAVE SWEETENED OUR BILE; MOREOVER IN A HURRIED WORLD WHO WOULD STOP TO ANSWER OUR INSOLENCES TO DELIGHT IN OUR HOWLS?

THAT THE GREATEST CONNOISSEUR OF HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICKNAMD “DOG” PROVES THAT MAN HAS NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO ACCEPT HIS AUTHENTIC IMAGE AND THAT HE HAS ALWAYS REJECTED TRUTHS WITHOUT ACCOMMODATIONS. DIOGENES SUPPRESSED POSE IN HIMSELF. WHAT A MONSTER IN OTHER MEN’S EYES! TO HAVE AN HONORABLE PLACE IN PHILOSOPHY YOU MUST BE AN ACTOR YOU MUST RESPECT THE PLAY OF IDEAS AND EXERCISE YOURSELF OVER FALSE PROBLEMS. IN NO CASE MUST MAN AS SUCH BE YOUR BUSINESS. AGAIN ACCORDING TO DIOGENES LAËRTIUS: “AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES WHEN THE HERALD PROCLAIMED: ‘DIOXIPPUS HAS VANQUISHED MEN!’ DIOGENES ANSWERED: 'HE HAS VANQUISHED ONLY SLAVES—MEN ARE MY BUSINESS/ “ AND INDEED HE VANQUISHED MEN AS NO ONE ELSE HAS EVER DONE WITH WEAPONS MORE DREADFUL THAN THOSE OF CONQUERORS THOUGH HE OWNED ONLY A BROOM THE LEAST PROPRIETARY OF ALL BEGGARS TRUE SAINT OF MOCKERY.

BY A LUCKY ACCIDENT HE WAS BORN BEFORE THE CROSS MADE ITS APPEARANCE. WHO KNOWS IF GRAFTED ON HIS DETACHMENT SOME UNHEALTHY TEMPTATION OF EXTRA-HUMAN RISK MIGHT NOT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO BECOME AN ORDINARY ASCETIC LATER CANONIZED LOST IN THE MASS OF THE BLESSED AND THE MAZE OF THE CALENDAR? THEN HE WOULD HAVE GONE MAD HE TOO THE MOST PROFOUNDLY NORMAL OF MEN SINCE HE WAS REMOTE FROM ALL TEACHING AND ALL DOCTRINE. THE HIDEOUS COUNTENANCE OF MAN—DIOGENES WAS THE ONLY ONE TO REVEAL THAT TO US. THE MERITS OF CYNICISM HAVE BEEN DIMMED AND DOWNTRODDEN BY A RELIGION OPPOSED TO THE EVIDENT. BUT THE MOMENT HAS COME TO CONFRONT THE TRUTHS OF THE SON OF GOD WITH THOSE OF THIS “CELESTIAL DOG” AS A POET OF HIS TIME CALLED HIM.

AMBIGUITY OF GENIUS
ALL INSPIRATION PROCEEDS FROM A FACULTY OF EXAGGERATION: LYRICISM—AND THE WHOLE WORLD OF METAPHOR—WOULD BE A PITIABLE EXCITATION WITHOUT THAT RAPTURE WHICH DILATES WORDS UNTIL THEY BURST. WHEN THE ELEMENTS OR THE DIMENSIONS OF THE COSMOS SEEM TOO DIMINISHED TO SERVE AS TERMS OF COMPARISON FOR OUR CONDITIONS POETRY NEEDS—IN ORDER TO TRANSCEND ITS STAGE OF VIRTUALITY AND IMMINENCE—ONLY A LITTLE CLARITY IN THE FLASHES WHICH PREFIGURE AND BEGET IT. NO TRUE INSPIRATION FAILS TO RISE OUT OF THE ANOMALY OF A SOUL VASTER THAN THE WORLD. . . . IN THE VERBAL CONFLAGRATION OF A SHAKESPEARE AND A SHELLEY WE SMELL THE ASH OF WORDS BACKWASH AND EFFLUVIUM OF AN IMPOSSIBLE COSMOGONY. THE TERMS ENCROACH UPON EACH OTHER AS THOUGH NONE COULD ATTAIN THE EQUIVALENT OF THE INNER DILATION; THIS IS THE HERNIA OF THE IMAGE THE TRANSCENDENT RUPTURE OF POOR WORDS BORN OF EVERYDAY USE AND MIRACULOUSLY RAISED TO THE HEART’S ALTITUDES. THE TRUTHS OF BEAUTY ARE FED ON EXAGGERATIONS WHICH UPON THE MEREST ANALYSIS TURN OUT TO BE MONSTROUS AND MEANINGLESS. POETRY: DEMIURGICAL DIVAGATION OF THE VOCABULARY. . . . HAS CHARLATANISM EVER BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY COMBINED WITH ECSTASY? LYING THE WELLSPRING OF ALL TEARS! SUCH IS THE IMPOSTURE OF GENIUS AND THE SECRET OF ART. TRIFLES SWOLLEN TO THE HEAVENS; THE IMPROBABLE GENERATOR OF A UNIVERSE! IN EVERY GENIUS COEXISTS A BRAGGART AND A GOD.

IDOLATRY OF DISASTER
ALL THAT WE BUILD BEYOND RAW EXISTENCE ALL THE MANY POWERS WHICH GIVE THE WORLD A PHYSIOGNOMY WE OWE TO MISFORTUNE—ARCHITECT OF DIVERSITY INTELLIGIBLE INSTRUMENT OF OUR ACTIONS. WHAT ITS SPHERE FAILS TO ENGROSS TRANSCENDS US: WHAT MEANING COULD AN EVENT HAVE WHICH FAILS TO BE OVERWHELMING? THE FUTURE AWAITS US IN ORDER TO IMMOLATE US: THE MIND RECORDS NOTHING BUT THE FRACTURE OF EXISTENCE NOW AND THE SENSES STILL VIBRATE ONLY IN THE EXPECTATION OF DISASTER. . . . HOW AVOID CONSIDERING THE FATE OF CHATEAUBRIAND’S SISTER LUCILE OR OF KAROLINE VON GÜNDERODE AND MURMURING WITH THE FORMER: “I SHALL FALL INTO THE SLEEP OF DEATH UPON MY DESTINY” OR GULPING THE LATTER’S DESPAIR WHICH PLUNGED A DAGGER INTO HER HEART? APART FROM A FEW EXAMPLES OF EXHAUSTIVE MELANCHOLY AND A FEW UNEQUALED SUICIDES MEN ARE MERELY PUPPETS STUFFED WITH RED GLOBULES IN ORDER TO BEGET HISTORY AND ITS GRIMACES.

WHEN IDOLATERS OF DISASTER WE MAKE IT THE AGENT AND THE SUBSTANCE OF BECOMING WE BATHE IN THE LIMPIDITY OF THE PRESCRIBED FATE IN A DAWN OF CATASTROPHES IN A FRUITFUL GEHENNA. . . . BUT WHEN IMAGINING WE HAVE EXHAUSTED IT WE FEAR WE SHALL OUTLIVE IT EXISTENCE DARKENS AND NO LONGER BECOMES. AND WE DREAD READAPTING OURSELVES TO HOPE . . . BETRAYING OUR DISASTER BETRAYING OURSELVES. . . .

THE DEMON
HE IS THERE IN THE BLOOD’S INFERNO IN THE BITTERNESS OF EACH CELL IN THE SHUDDER OF OUR NERVES IN THOSE CONTRARY PRAYERS EXHALED BY HATE EVERYWHERE WHERE HE MAKES OUT OF HORROR HIS COMFORT. SHOULD I LET HIM UNDERMINE MY HOURS WHEN AS A METICULOUS ACCOMPLICE OF MY DESTRUCTION I COULD VOMIT UP MY HOPES AND DESIST FROM MYSELF? HE SHARES—MURDEROUS TENANT—MY BED MY OBLIVIONS AND MY INSOMNIAS; TO LOSE HIM MY OWN LOSS IS NECESSARY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY A BODY AND A SOUL THE ONE TOO HEAVY AND THE OTHER TOO DIM HOW BEAR AS WELL AN ADDITIONAL WEIGHT A FURTHER DARKNESS? HOW DRAG YOUR WAY THROUGH A DARK TIME? I DREAM OF A GOLDEN MOMENT OUTSIDE OF BECOMING A SUNLIT MOMENT TRANSCENDING THE TORMENT OF THE ORGANS AND THE MELODY OF THEIR DECOMPOSITION.

TO HEAR THE SOBS—AGONIZED JOYOUS—OF THAT EVIL ONE WHO WRIGGLES THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS AND NOT TO STRANGLE THE INTRUDER? BUT IF YOU ATTACK HIM IT WILL ONLY BE OUT OF SOME FUTILE SELF-INDULGENCE. HE IS ALREADY YOUR PSEUDONYM; YOU CANNOT DO HIM VIOLENCE WITHOUT IMPUNITY. WHY EVADE THE APPROACH OF THE LAST ACT? WHY NOT ATTACK YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN NAME?

(IT WOULD BE QUITE FALSE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DEMONIAC “REVELATION” IS A PRESENCE INSEPARABLE FROM OUR DURATION; YET WHEN WE ARE GRIPPED BY IT WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE QUANTITY OF NEUTRAL MOMENTS WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH BEFORE. TO INVOKE THE DEVIL IS TO TINGE WITH A VESTIGE OF THEOLOGY AN AMBIGUOUS EXCITATION WHICH OUR PRIDE REFUSES TO ACCEPT AS SUCH. BUT WHO DOES NOT KNOW THESE FEARS IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES FACE TO FACE WITH THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS? OUR PRIDE NEEDS A NAME A GREAT NAME IN ORDER TO BAPTIZE AN ANGUISH WHICH WOULD BE PITIABLE IF IT EMANATED ONLY FROM PHYSIOLOGY. THE TRADITIONAL EXPLANATION SEEMS MORE FLATTERING TO US; A RESIDUE OF METAPHYSICS SUITS THE MIND. . . .

IT IS IN THIS WAY THAT—IN ORDER TO VEIL OUR TOO IMMEDIATE ILLS—WE RESORT TO ELEGANT ALTHOUGH OBSOLETE ENTITIES. HOW ADMIT THAT OUR MOST MYSTERIOUS DELIRIUMS PROCEED FROM NO MORE THAN NERVOUS DISEASES WHEREAS IT IS ENOUGH FOR US TO THINK OF THE DEMON IN US OR OUTSIDE US IN ORDER TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AGAIN AT ONCE? WE INHERIT FROM OUR ANCESTORS THAT PROPENSITY TO OBJECTIVIZE OUR INMOST EVILS; MYTHOLOGY HAS IMPREGNATED OUR BLOOD AND LITERATURE HAS SUSTAINED IN US A RELISH FOR EFFECTS. . . .)

THE MOCKERY OF A “NEW LIFE”
NAILED TO OURSELVES WE LACK THE CAPACITY OF LEAVING THE PATH INSCRIBED IN THE INNATENESS OF OUR DESPAIR. EXEMPT OURSELVES FROM LIFE BECAUSE IT IS NOT OUR ELEMENT? NO ONE HANDS OUT DIPLOMAS OF NON-EXISTENCE. WE MUST PERSEVERE IN BREATHING FEEL THE AIR BURN OUR LIPS ACCUMULATE REGRETS AT THE HEART OF A REALITY WHICH WE HAVE NOT HOPED FOR AND RENOUNCE GIVING AN EXPLANATION FOR THE DISEASE WHICH BRINGS ABOUT OUR DOWNFALL. WHEN EACH MOMENT OF TIME RUSHES UPON US LIKE A DAGGER WHEN OUR FLESH INSTIGATED BY OUR DESIRES REFUSES TO BE PETRIFIED—HOW CONFRONT A SINGLE MOMENT ADDED TO OUR FATE? WITH THE HELP OF WHAT ARTIFICES MIGHT WE FIND THE STRENGTH OF ILLUSION TO GO IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER LIFE—A NEW LIFE?

IT IS BECAUSE ALL MEN WHO CAST A GLANCE OVER THEIR PAST RUINS IMAGINE—IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RUINS TO COME—THAT IT IS IN THEIR POWER TO RECOMMENCE SOMETHING RADICALLY NEW. THEY MAKE THEMSELVES A SOLEMN PROMISE WAITING FOR A MIRACLE WHICH WOULD EXTRICATE THEM FROM THIS AVERAGE ABYSS INTO WHICH FATE HAS PLUNGED THEM. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THEY ALL CONTINUE TO BE THE SAME MODIFIED ONLY BY THE ACCENTUATION OF THIS TENDENCY TO DECLINE WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC. WE SEE AROUND US ONLY DILAPIDATED INSPIRATIONS AND ARDORS: EVERY MAN PROMISES EVERYTHING BUT EVERY MAN LIVES TO KNOW THE FRAGILITY OF HIS SPARK AND LIFE’S LACK OF GENIUS IN HIS LIFE. THE AUTHENTICITY OF AN EXISTENCE CONSISTS IN ITS OWN RAIN. THE CROWN OF OUR BECOMING: A PATH THAT LOOKS GLORIOUS AND WHICH LEADS TO A ROUT; THE GARLAND OF OUR GIFTS: CAMOUFLAGE OF OUR GANGRENE. . . . UNDER THE SUN TRIUMPHS A CARRION SPRING; BEAUTY ITSELF IS MERELY DEATH PREENING AMONG THE BUDS. . . .

I HAVE KNOWN NO “NEW” LIFE WHICH WAS NOT ILLUSORY AND COMPROMISED AT ITS ROOTS. I HAVE SEEN EACH MAN ADVANCE INTO TIME TO BE ISOLATED IN AN ANGUISHED RUMINATION AND TO FALL BACK INTO HIMSELF WITH AS THE SIGN OF RENEWAL THE UNFORESEEN GRIMACE OF HIS OWN HOPES.

TRIPLE IMPASSE
THE MIND DISCOVERS IDENTITY; THE SOUL ENNUI; THE BODY SLOTH. IT IS ONE AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF INVARIABILITY DIFFERENTLY EXPRESSED UNDER THE THREE FORMS OF THE UNIVERSAL YAWN.

THE MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE JUSTIFIES THE RATIONALISTS' THESIS; IT SHOWS US A LEGAL UNIVERSE IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS ANTICIPATED AND ADJUSTED; THE BARBARISM OF NO SURPRISE COMES TO TROUBLE ITS HARMONY. IF THE SAME MIND DISCOVERS CONTRADICTION THE SAME SOUL DELIRIUM THE SAME BODY FRENZY IT IS IN ORDER TO BEGET NEW UNREALITIES TO ESCAPE A UNIVERSE TOO DEMONSTRABLY THE SAME; AND IT IS THE ANTI-RATIONALISTS’ THESIS WHICH PREVAILS. THE FLOWERING OF ABSURDITIES REVEALS AN EXISTENCE BEFORE WHICH ALL CLARITY OF VISION SEEMS MOCKINGLY POOR. THIS IS THE PERPETUAL AGGRESSION OF THE UNFORESEEABLE.

BETWEEN THESE TWO TENDENCIES MAN WIELDS HIS AMBIGUITY: FINDING HIS PLACE IN NEITHER LIFE NOR IDEA HE SUPPOSES HIMSELF PREDESTINED TO THE ARBITRARY; YET HIS INTOXICATION OF FREEDOM IS ONLY A SHUDDER WITHIN A FATALITY THE FORM OF HIS FATE BEING NO LESS REGULATED THAN THAT OF A SONNET OR A STAR.

COSMOGONY OF DESIRE
HAVING LIVED OUT—HAVING VERIFIED ALL THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST LIFE—I HAVE STRIPPED IT OF ITS SAVORS AND WALLOWING IN ITS LEES I HAVE EXPERIENCED ITS NAKEDNESS. I HAVE KNOWN POST-SEXUAL METAPHYSICS THE VOID OF THE FUTILELY PROCREATED UNIVERSE AND THAT DISSIPATION OF SWEAT WHICH PLUNGES YOU INTO AN AGE-OLD CHILL ANTERIOR TO THE RAGES OF MATTER. AND I HAVE TRIED TO BE FAITHFUL TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO FORCE MY INSTINCTS TO YIELD AND REALIZED THAT IT IS NO USE WIELDING THE WEAPONS OF NOTHINGNESS IF YOU CANNOT TURN THEM AGAINST YOURSELF. FOR THE OUTBURST OF DESIRES AMID OUR KNOWLEDGE WHICH CONTRADICTS THEM CREATES A DREADFUL CONFLICT BETWEEN OUR MIND OPPOSING THE CREATION AND THE IRRATIONAL SUBSTRATUM WHICH BINDS US TO IT STILL.

EACH DESIRE HUMILIATES THE SUM OF OUR TRUTHS AND FORCES US TO RECONSIDER OUR NEGATIONS. WE ENDURE A PRACTICAL DEFEAT; YET OUR PRINCIPLES REMAIN UNSHAKABLE. .  . WE HOPED TO BE NO LONGER CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD AND HERE WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPETITES LIKE EQUIVOCAL ASCETICS MASTERS OF TIME AND GRAFTED TO OUR GLANDS. BUT THIS INTERPLAY IS LIMITLESS: EACH OF OUR DESIRES RECREATES THE WORLD AND EACH OF OUR THOUGHTS ANNIHILATES IT. . . . IN EVERYDAY LIFE COSMOGONY ALTERNATES WITH APOCALYPSE: QUOTIDIAN CREATORS AND WRECKERS WE ENACT ON AN INFINITESIMAL SCALE THE ETERNAL MYTHS AND EACH OF OUR MOMENTS REPRODUCES AND PREFIGURES THE FATE OF SEED AND CINDER PERTAINING TO INFINITY.

INTERPRETATION OF ACTIONS
NO ONE WOULD PERFORM THE MEREST ACTION WITHOUT THE FEELING THAT THIS ACTION IS THE ONE AND ONLY REALITY. SUCH BLINDNESS IS THE ABSOLUTE BASIS THE INDISPUTABLE PRINCIPLE OF ALL THAT EXISTS. THE MAN WHO ARGUES MERELY PROVES THAT HE IS LESS THAT DOUBT HAS SAPPED HIS VITALITY. . . . BUT AMID HIS VERY DOUBTS HE MUST FEEL THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS PROGRESS TOWARD NEGATION. TO KNOW THAT NOTHING IS WORTH THE TROUBLE BECOMES IMPLICITLY A BELIEF HENCE A POSSIBILITY OF ACTION; THIS IS BECAUSE EVEN A TRIFLE OF EXISTENCE PRESUPPOSES AN UNAVOWED FAITH; A SIMPLE STEP—EVEN TOWARD A MOCK-UP OF REALITY—IS AN APOSTASY WITH REGARD TO NOTHINGNESS; BREATHING ITSELF PROCEEDS FROM AN IMPLICIT FANATICISM LIKE ANY PARTICIPATION IN MOVEMENT. . . .

LIFE WITHOUT OBJECTIVE
NEUTRAL IDEAS LIKE DRY EYES; DULL LOOKS WHICH STRIP THINGS OF ALL DIMENSION; SELF-AUSCULTATIONS WHICH REDUCE THE FEELINGS TO PHENOMENA OF ATTENTION; A VAPOROUS LIFE WITHOUT TEARS AND WITHOUT LAUGHTER—HOW TO INCULCATE A SAP A VERNAL VULGARITY? AND HOW TO ENDURE THIS RESIGNING HEART THIS TIME TOO BLUNTED TO TRANSMIT EVEN TO ITS OWN SEASONS THE FERMENT OF GROWTH AND DISSOLUTION?

WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN A CORRUPTION IN EVERY CONVICTION AND IN EVERY ATTACHMENT A PROFANATION YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT ON EARTH OR ELSEWHERE A FATE MODIFIED BY HOPE. YOU MUST CHOOSE SOME IDEAL ABSURDLY SOLITARY PROMONTORY OR A FARCICAL STAR REFRACTORY TO ALL CONSTELLATIONS. IRRESPONSIBLE OUT OF MELANCHOLY YOUR LIFE HAS FLOUTED ITS MOMENTS; NOW LIFE IS THE PIETY OF DURATION THE FEELING OF A DANCING ETERNITY TIME TRANSCENDING ITSELF AND VIES WITH THE SUN. . . .

ACEDIA
THIS STAGNATION OF THE ORGANS THIS STUPOR OF THE FACULTIES THIS PETRIFIED SMILE—DO THEY NOT OFTEN REMIND YOU OF THE ENNUI OF THE CLOISTERS HEARTS ABANDONED BY GOD THE DRYNESS AND IDIOCY OF THE MONKS LOATHING THEMSELVES IN THE ECSTATIC TRANSPORTS OF MASTURBATION? YOU ARE MERELY A MONK WITHOUT DIVINE HYPOTHESES AND WITHOUT THE PRIDE OF SOLITARY VICE.

EARTH HEAVEN ARE THE WALLS OF YOUR CELL AND IN THE AIR NO BREATH DISTURBS ONLY THE ABSENCE OF ORISONS PREVAILS. DOOMED TO THE EMPTY HOURS OF ETERNITY TO THE PERIPHERY OF SHUDDERS AND THE MILDEWED DESIRES THAT ROT AT THE APPROACH OF SALVATION YOU BESTIR YOURSELF TOWARD A LAST JUDGMENT WITHOUT SPLENDOR AND TRUMPETS WHILE YOUR THOUGHTS FOR SOLEMNITY HAVE IMAGINED NO MORE THAN THE UNREAL PROCESSION OF HOPES.

BY GRACE OF SUFFERING SOULS ONCE FLUNG THEMSELVES TOWARD THE VAULTING ARCHES; YOU STUMBLE AGAINST THEM NOW AND YOU FALL BACK INTO THE WORLD AS INTO A FAITHLESS CONVENT LAGGING ON THE BOULEVARD ORDER OF LOST CREATURES—AND OF YOUR PERDITION.

CRIMES OF COURAGE AND FEAR
TO BE AFRAID IS TO THINK OF YOURSELF CONTINUALLY TO BE UNABLE TO IMAGINE AN OBJECTIVE COURSE OF EVENTS. THE SENSATION OF THE TERRIBLE THE SENSATION THAT IT IS ALL HAPPENING AGAINST YOU SUPPOSES A WORLD CONCEIVED WITHOUT INDIFFERENT DANGERS. THE FRIGHTENED MAN—VICTIM OF AN EXAGGERATED SUBJECTIVITY—BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE MUCH MORE THAN THE REST OF HIS KIND THE TARGET OF HOSTILE EVENTS. HE ENCOUNTERS THE BRAVE MAN IN THIS ERROR FOR THE BRAVE MAN AT THE ANTIPODES SEES ONLY INVULNERABILITY EVERYWHERE. BOTH HAVE ATTAINED THE EXTREMITY OF A SELF-INFATUATED CONSCIOUSNESS: EVERYTHING CONSPIRES AGAINST THE ONE; TO THE OTHER EVERYTHING IS FAVORABLE. (THE BRAVE MAN IS ONLY A BRAGGART WHO EMBRACES THE DANGER WHO FLEES TOWARD THE DANGER.) ONE ESTABLISHES HIMSELF NEGATIVELY AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD THE OTHER POSITIVELY; BUT THEIR ILLUSION IS THE SAME THEIR KNOWLEDGE HAVING AN IDENTICAL POINT OF DEPARTURE: DANGER AS THE ONLY REALITY. ONE FEARS IT THE OTHER SEEKS IT OUT: THEY CANNOT CONCEIVE A LUCID SCORN OF THINGS THEY BOTH RELATE EVERYTHING TO THEMSELVES THEY ARE OVER-AGITATED (AND ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM THE EXCESS OF AGITATION FROM THE DYNAMIC FICTIONS OF BRAVERY AND COWARDICE). THUS THESE ANTINOMIC AND EQUAL EXAMPLES ARE THE AGENTS OF ALL OUR TROUBLES THE DISTURBERS OF THE MARCH OF TIME; THEY GIVE AN AFFECTIVE TINGE TO THE LEAST EVENT AND PROJECT THEIR FEVERED INTENTIONS UPON A UNIVERSE WHICH-—WITHOUT AN ABANDONMENT TO CALM DISGUSTS—IS DEGRADING AND INTOLERABLE. COURAGE AND FEAR TWO POLES OF THE SAME DISEASE WHICH CONSISTS IN GRANTING AN ABUSIVE SENSE AND SERIOUSNESS TO LIFE . . . IT IS THE LACK OF NONCHALANT BITTERNESS WHICH MAKES MEN INTO SECTARIAN BEASTS; THE SUBTLEST AND THE CRUDEST CRIMES ARE PERPETRATED BY THOSE WHO TAKE THINGS SERIOUSLY. ONLY THE DILETTANTE HAS NO TASTE FOR BLOOD HE ALONE IS NO SCOUNDREL . . . .

DISINTOXICATION
THE NON-MYSTERIOUS CONCERNS OF HUMAN BEINGS MAY BE DRAWN AS CLEARLY AS THE OUTLINES OF THIS PAGE. . . . WHAT IS TO BE INSCRIBED HERE BUT THE DISGUST OF GENERATIONS LINKED LIKE PROPOSITIONS IN THE STERILE FATALITY OF A SYLLOGISM?

THE HUMAN ADVENTURE WILL CERTAINLY COME TO AN END WHICH WE MAY CONCEIVE WITHOUT BEING ITS CONTEMPORARY. WHEN WE HAVE CONSUMMATED IN OURSELVES THE DIVORCE WITH HISTORY IT IS QUITE SUPERFLUOUS TO ATTEND THE FORMALITIES. WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT MAN IN THE FACE TO DETACH OURSELVES FROM HIM AND TO NO LONGER REGRET HIS HOAXES. THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF SUFFERINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE SOFTENED THE HEARTS OF STONES MERELY PETRIFIED THIS STEELY MAYFLY MONSTROUS EXAMPLE OF EVANESCENCE AND HARDENING DRIVEN BY ONE INSIPID MADNESS A WILL TO EXIST AT ONCE IMPERCEPTIBLE AND SHAMELESS. WHEN WE REALIZE THAT NO HUMAN MOTIVE IS COMPATIBLE WITH INFINITY AND THAT NO GESTURE IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF MAKING IT OUR HEART BY ITS VERY BEATING CAN NO LONGER CONCEAL ITS VACUITY. MEN MINGLE IN A UNIFORM FATE AS FUTILE FOR THE INDIFFERENT EYE AS THE STARS—OR THE CROSSES OF A MILITARY CEMETERY. OF ALL THE GOALS PROPOSED FOR EXISTENCE WHICH ONE SUBJECTED TO ANALYSIS ESCAPES THE MUSIC-HALL OR THE MORGUE? WHICH FAILS TO REVEAL US AS FUTILE OR SINISTER? AND IS THERE A SINGLE STROKE OF MAGIC IS THERE ONE CHARM WHICH CAN STILL DECEIVE US?

(WHEN WE ARE FORBIDDEN VISIBLE PRESCRIPTIONS WE BECOME LIKE THE DEVIL METAPHYSICALLY ILLEGAL; WE HAVE LEFT THE ORDER OF THE WORLD: NO LONGER FINDING A PLACE THERE WE LOOK AT IT WITHOUT RECOGNITION; STUPEFACTION TURNS INTO A REFLEX WHILE OUR PLAINTIVE ASTONISHMENT LACKING AN OBJECT IS FOREVER FASTENED TO THE VOID WE UNDERGO SENSATIONS WHICH NO LONGER CORRESPOND TO THINGS BECAUSE NOTHING IRRITATES THEM ANY LONGER; THUS WE TRANSCEND EVEN THE DREAM OF THE ANGEL OF MELANCHOLIA AND WE REGRET THAT DÜRER DID NOT LANGUISH FOR EYES EVEN MORE REMOTE. . . .

WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS TOO CONCRETE TOO-EXISTENT INCLUDING OUR NOBLEST VISION AND WE SIGH FOR AN INDEFINITE WHICH WOULD PROCEED FROM NEITHER LIFE NOR DEATH WHEN EVERY CONTACT WITH BEING IS A VIOLATION OF THE SOUL THE SOUL HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION AND NO LONGER HAVING ANY ACCOUNTING TO MAKE OR LAWS TO INFRINGE VIES—BY MELANCHOLY—WITH THE DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE.)

ITINERARY OF HATE
I HATE NO ONE; BUT HATRED BLACKENS MY BLOOD AND SCORCHES THIS SKIN WHICH THE YEARS WERE POWERLESS TO TAN. HOW PREVAIL UNDER TENDER OR RIGOROUS JUDGMENTS OVER A HIDEOUS GLOOM AND THE SCREAM OF A MAN FLAYED ALIVE?

    I WANTED TO LOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH THEIR EXPLOITS AND THEIR FEVERS—AND I HAVE FOUND NOTHING WHICH FAILED TO REMIND ME OF DEATH": FLOWERS STARS FACES—SYMBOLS OF WITHERING POTENTIAL SLABS OF ALL POSSIBLE TOMBS! WHAT IS CREATED IN LIFE AND ENNOBLES IT TENDS TOWARD A MACABRE OR MEDIOCRE END THE EFFERVESCENCE OF HEARTS HAS PROVOKED DISASTERS WHICH NO DEMON WOULD HAVE DARED CONCEIVE. LOOK UPON A MIND ENFLAMED AND BE SURE THAT YOU WILL END BY BEING ITS VICTIM. THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEIR TRUTH—THE ONLY ONES WHOSE IMPRINT IS RETAINED BY THE MEMORY OF MEN—LEAVE THE EARTH BEHIND THEM STREWN WITH CORPSES. RELIGIONS NUMBER IN THEIR LEDGERS MORE MURDERS THAN THE BLOODIEST TYRANNIES ACCOUNT FOR AND THOSE WHOM HUMANITY HAS CALLED DIVINE FAR SURPASS THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MURDERERS IN THEIR THIRST FOR SLAUGHTER.

THE MAN WHO PROPOSES A NEW FAITH IS PERSECUTED UNTIL IT IS HIS TURN TO BECOME A PERSECUTOR: TRUTHS BEGIN BY A CONFLICT WITH THE POLICE AND END BY CALLING THEM IN; FOR EACH ABSURDITY WE HAVE SUFFERED FOR DEGENERATES INTO A LEGALITY AS EVERY MARTYRDOM ENDS IN THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE LAW IN THE INSIPIDITIES OF THE CALENDAR OR THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE STREETS. IN THIS WORLD HEAVEN ITSELF BECOMES AUTHORITY; AND WE KNOW AGES WHICH LIVED ONLY BY IT—MIDDLE AGES MORE PRODIGAL IN WARS THAN THE MOST DISSOLUTE EPOCHS BESTIAL CRUSADES TRICKED OUT AS SUBLIMITIES BEFORE WHICH THE INVASIONS OF THE HUNS SEEM THE REFRAINS OF DECADENT HORDES.

IMMACULATE EXPLOITS DECLINE INTO PUBLIC ENTERPRISE; CONSECRATION DIMS THE MOST AERIAL HALO. AN ANGEL PROTECTED BY A POLICEMAN—THAT IS HOW TRUTHS DIE THAT IS HOW ENTHUSIASMS EXPIRE. IT IS ENOUGH THAT A REBELLION BE RIGHT AND CREATE ADHERENTS A REVELATION BE PROPAGATED AND AN INSTITUTION CONFISCATE IT FOR THE ONCE-SOLITARY TRANSPORTS—DIVIDED AMONG A FEW NEOPHYTE DREAMERS—TO BE CORRUPTED IN A PROSTITUTED EXISTENCE. SHOW ME ONE THING HERE ON EARTH WHICH HAS BEGUN WELL AND WHICH HAS NOT ENDED BADLY. THE PROUDEST PALPITATIONS ARE ENGULFED IN A SEWER WHERE THEY CEASE THROBBING AS THOUGH HAVING REACHED THEIR NATURAL TERM: THIS DOWNFALL CONSTITUTES THE HEART’S DRAMA AND THE NEGATIVE MEANING OF HISTORY. EACH “IDEAL” FED AT ITS BEGINNING ON THE BLOOD OF ITS VOTARIES ERODES AND COLLAPSES WHEN IT IS ADOPTED BY THE MOB. THE FONT TRANSFORMED INTO A SPITTOON: THAT IS THE INELUCTABLE RHYTHM OF “PROGRESS". . .

UNDER THESE CONDITIONS UPON WHOM ARE WE TO POUR OUT OUR HATRED? NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING AND STILL LESS FOR BEING WHAT HE IS. AFFLICTED WITH EXISTENCE EACH MAN ENDURES LIKE AN ANIMAL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH PROCEED FROM IT. THUS IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS DETESTABLE HATRED BECOMES HUGER THAN THE WORLD AND HAVING TRANSCENDED ITS OBJECT CANCELS ITSELF OUT.

(IT IS NOT OUR SUSPECT EXHAUSTIONS OR THE SPECIFIC DISTURBANCES OF OUR ORGANS WHICH REVEAL THE LOW. POINT OF OUR VITALITY; NOR IS IT OUR PERPLEXITIES OR THE VARIATIONS OF THE THERMOMETER; BUT WE NEED MERELY ENDURE THOSE FITS OF HATRED AND PITY WITHOUT MOTIVE THOSE NON-MEASURABLE FEVERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR EQUILIBRIUM IS THREATENED. TO HATE EVERYTHING AND TO HATE YOURSELF IN A FRENZY OF CANNIBAL RAGE; TO PITY EVERYONE AND TO PITY YOURSELF—APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES BUT AT THEIR SOURCE IDENTICAL; FOR WE CAN PITY ONLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH WHAT DOES NOT DESERVE TO EXIST. AND IN THESE CONVULSIONS THE MAN WHO ENDURES THEM AND THE UNIVERSE TO WHICH THEY ARE ADDRESSED ARE DOOMED TO THE SAME DESTRUCTIVE AND PITYING FURY. WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU ARE OVERCOME WITH COMPASSION WITHOUT KNOWING FOR WHOM IT IS BECAUSE A LASSITUDE OF THE ORGANS PRESAGES A DANGEROUS DECLINE; AND WHEN THIS VAGUE AND UNIVERSAL COMPASSION TURNS TOWARD YOURSELF YOU ARE IN THE CONDITION OF THE LAST AND LEAST OF MEN. IT IS FROM AN ENORMOUS PHYSICAL WEAKNESS THAT THIS NEGATIVE SOLIDARITY EMANATES A SOLIDARITY WHICH IN HATE OR PITY BINDS US TO THINGS. THESE TWO FRENZIES SIMULTANEOUS OR CONSECUTIVE ARE NOT SO MUCH UNCERTAIN SYMPTOMS AS CLEAR SIGNS OF A FALLING VITALITY IRRITATED BY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING—FROM UNDELINEATED EXISTENCE TO THE PRECISION OF OUR OWN PERSON.

YET WE MUST NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES: THESE OUTBREAKS ARE THE CLEAREST AND THE MOST IMMODERATE BUT SCARCELY THE ONLY ONES; AT DIFFERENT DEGREES EVERYTHING IS PATHOLOGY EXCEPT FOR INDIFFERENCE.)

“LA PERDUTA GENTE”
WHAT A PREPOSTEROUS NOTION TO DRAW CIRCLES IN HELL TO MAKE THE INTENSITY OF THE FLAMES VARY IN ITS COMPARTMENTS TO HIERARCHIZE ITS TORMENTS! THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE THERE; THE REST—MERE FIORITURAS OR . . . BURNS. IN THE HEAVENLY CITY—GENTLER PREFIGURATION OF THE ONE BELOW BOTH BEING UNDER THE SAME MANAGEMENT—THE ESSENTIAL THING TOO IS NOT TO BE SOMETHING—KING BOURGEOIS DAY-LABORER—BUT TO ADHERE TO IT OR TO ESCAPE IT. YOU CAN CHAMPION SOME IDEA OR OTHER HAVE A PLACE OR CRAWL—FROM THE MOMENT YOUR ACTIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS SERVE A FORM OF REAL OR IMAGINED CITY YOU ARE ITS IDOLATORS AND ITS CAPTIVES. THE TIMIDEST EMPLOYEE AND THE WILDEST ANARCHIST IF THEY TAKE A DIFFERENT INTEREST HERE LIVE AS ITS FUNCTION: THEY ARE BOTH CITIZENS INTERNALLY THOUGH THE ONE PREFERS HIS SLIPPERS AND THE OTHER HIS BOMB. THE “CIRCLES” OF THE EARTHLY CITY LIKE THOSE OF THE ONE UNDERGROUND IMPRISON BEINGS IN A DAMNED COMMUNITY AND DRAG THEM IN THE SAME PROCESSION OF SUFFERINGS IN WHICH TO LOOK FOR NUANCES WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. THE MAN WHO ACQUIESCES IN HUMAN AFFAIRS—IN ANY FORM REVOLUTIONARY OR CONSERVATIVE—CONSUMES HIMSELF IN A PITIABLE DELECTATION: HE COMMINGLES HIS NOBILITIES AND HIS VULGARITIES IN THE CONFUSION OF BECOMING. . . .

TO THE DISSENTER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE CITY RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE IN THE COURSE OF GREAT EVENTS OR SMALL ALL MODALITIES OF LIFE IN COMMON SEEM EQUALLY CONTEMPTIBLE. HISTORY CAN OFFER HIM ONLY THE PALE INTEREST OF RENEWED DISAPPOINTMENTS AND ANTICIPATED ARTIFICES. THE MAN WHO HAS LIVED AMONG MEN AND STILL LIES IN WAIT FOR A SINGLE UNEXPECTED EVENT—SUCH A MAN HAS UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND NEVER WILL. HE IS RIPE FOR THE CITY: EVERYTHING MUST BE GIVEN HIM EVERY OFFICE AND EVERY HONOR. SO IT IS WITH ALL MEN—WHICH EXPLAINS THE LONGEVITY OF THIS SUBLUNARY HELL.

HISTORY AND LANGUAGE
WHO CAN RESIST THE AUTUMNAL WISDOM OF THE FLACCID AND FAISANDÉ CIVILIZATIONS? THE GREEK’S HORROR LIKE THE BELATED ROMAN’S OF FRESHNESS AND THE HYPERBOREAN REFLEXES EMANATED FROM A REPULSION FOR DAWNS FOR BARBARISM OVERFLOWING WITH FUTURES AND FOR THE STUPIDITIES OF HEALTH. THE RESPLENDENT CORRUPTION OF EVERY HISTORIC LATE-SEASON IS DARKENED BY THE PROXIMITY OF THE SCYTHIAN. NO CIVILIZATION CAN DRAW OUT AN INDEFINITE AGONY; TRIBES PROWL ABOUT SCENTING THE AROMAS OF PERFUMED CORPSES. . . . THUS THE ENTHUSIAST OF SUNSETS CONTEMPLATES THE FAILURE OF ALL REFINEMENT AND THE INSOLENT ADVANCE OF VITALITY. NOTHING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO BUT COLLECT FROM THE SUM OF THE FUTURE A FEW ANECDOTES. .. . A SYSTEM OF EVENTS NO LONGER PROVES ANYTHING: THE GREAT DEEDS HAVE JOINED THE FAIRY TALES AND THE HANDBOOKS. THE GLORIOUS EXPLOITS OF THE PAST LIKE THE MEN WHO PERFORMED THEM ARE STILL OF INTEREST ONLY FOR THE FINE WORDS WHICH HAVE CONSECRATED THEM. WOE TO THE CONQUEROR WITHOUT A WORD TO SAY! JESUS HIMSELF THOUGH AN INDIRECT DICTATOR FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS MARKED THE MEMORY OF HIS FAITHFUL AND OF HIS DETRACTORS ONLY BY THE TATTERS OF PARADOXES WHICH STREW A BIOGRAPHY SO ADROITLY SCENIC. HOW INQUIRE ABOUT A MARTYR TODAY IF HE HAS NOT UTTERED REMARKS ADEQUATE TO HIS SUFFERINGS? WE KEEP THE MEMORY OF PAST OR RECENT VICTIMS ONLY IF THEIR LANGUAGE HAS IMMORTALIZED THE BLOOD WHICH HAS SPATTERED THEM. THE EXECUTIONERS THEMSELVES SURVIVE ONLY INSOFAR AS THEY WERE PERFORMERS: NERO WOULD BE LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN WITHOUT HIS OUTBURSTS OF BLOODY CLOWNING.

WHEN AT THE DYING MAN’S BEDSIDE HIS NEAREST AND DEAREST BEND OVER HIS STAMMERINGS IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO DECIPHER IN THEM SOME LAST WISH BUT RATHER TO GATHER UP A GOOD PHRASE WHICH THEY CAN QUOTE LATER ON IN ORDER TO HONOR HIS MEMORY. IF THE ROMAN HISTORIANS NEVER FAIL TO DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THEIR EMPERORS IT IS IN ORDER TO PLACE WITHIN THEM A SENTENCE OR AN EXCLAMATION WHICH THE LATTER UTTERED OR WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE UTTERED. THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL DEATHBEDS EVEN THE MOST ORDINARY. THAT LIFE SIGNIFIES NOTHING EVERYONE KNOWS OR SUSPECTS; LET IT AT LEAST BE SAVED BY A TURN OF PHRASE! A SENTENCE AT THE CORNERS OF THEIR LIFE—THAT IS ABOUT ALL WE ASK OF THE GREAT—AND OF THE SMALL. IF THEY FAIL THIS REQUIREMENT THIS OBLIGATION THEY ARE LOST FOREVER; FOR WE FORGIVE EVERYTHING DOWN TO CRIMES ON CONDITION THEY ARE EXQUISITELY GLOSSED—AND GLOSSED OVER. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTION MAN GRANTS HISTORY AS A WHOLE WHEN NO OTHER CRITERION IS SEEN TO BE OPERATIVE AND VALID AND WHEN HE HIMSELF RECAPITULATING THE GENERAL INANITY FINDS NO OTHER DIGNITY THAN THAT OF A LITTERATEUR OF FAILURE AND AN AESTHETE OF BLOODSHED.

IN THIS WORLD WHERE SUFFERINGS ARE MERGED AND BLURRED ONLY THE FORMULA PREVAILS.

PHILOSOPHY AND PROSTITUTION
THE PHILOSOPHER DISAPPOINTED WITH SYSTEMS AND SUPERSTITIONS BUT STILL PERSEVERING IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD SHOULD IMITATE THE SIDEWALK PYRRHONISM EXHIBITED BY THE LEAST DOGMATIC OF CREATURES: THE PROSTITUTE. DETACHED FROM EVERYTHING AND OPEN TO EVERYTHING; ESPOUSING HER CLIENT’S MOOD AND IDEAS; CHANGING TONE AND FACE ON EACH OCCASION; READY TO BE SAD OR GAY BEING INDIFFERENT; LAVISHING SIGHS OUT OF COMMERCIAL CONCERN; CASTING UPON THE FROLIC OF HER SUPERIMPOSED AND SINCERE NEIGHBOR AN ENLIGHTENED AND ARTIFICIAL GAZE—SHE PROPOSES TO THE MIND A MODEL OF BEHAVIOR WHICH VIES WITH THAT OF THE SAGES. TO BE WITHOUT CONVICTIONS IN REGARD TO MEN AND ONESELF SUCH IS THE HIGH LESSON OF PROSTITUTION PERIPATETIC ACADEMY OF LUCIDITY MARGINAL TO SOCIETY—AS IS PHILOSOPHY. “EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED IN THE SCHOOL OF WHORES!” SHOULD BE DIE EXCLAMATION OF THE THINKER WHO ACCEPTS EVERYTHING AND REJECTS EVERYTHING WHEN FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE HE HAS SPECIALIZED IN THE WEARY SMILE WHEN MEN ARE TO HIM MERELY CLIENTS AND DIE WORLD’S SIDEWALKS THE MARKETPLACE WHERE HE SELLS HIS BITTERNESS AS HIS COMPANIONS SELL THEIR BODIES.

OBSESSION OF THE ESSENTIAL
WHEN EVERY QUESTION SEEMS ACCIDENTAL AND PERIPHERAL WHEN THE MIND SEEKS EVER GREATER PROBLEMS IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ITS PROCEDURE IT NO LONGER COMES UP AGAINST ANY OBJECT BUT THE DIFFUSE OBSTACLE OF THE VOID. THEREUPON THE PHILOSOPHIC ENERGY EXCLUSIVELY ORIENTED TOWARD THE INACCESSIBLE IS EXPOSED TO RUIN. SCRUTINIZING THINGS AND THEIR TEMPORAL PRETEXTS IT IMPOSES SALUTARY EMBARRASSMENTS UPON ITSELF; BUT IF IT SEEKS AN INCREASINGLY GENERAL PRINCIPLE IT IS LOST AND ANNIHILATED IN THE VAGUENESS OF THE ESSENTIAL.

ONLY THOSE WHO STOP APROPOS IN PHILOSOPHY FLOURISH THOSE WHO ACCEPT THE LIMITATION AND THE COMFORT OF A REASONABLE STAGE OF ANXIETY. EVERY PROBLEM IF WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT LEADS TO BANKRUPTCY AND LEAVES THE INTELLECT EXPOSED: NO MORE QUESTIONS AND NO MORE ANSWERS IN A SPACE WITHOUT HORIZON. THE INTERROGATIONS TURN AGAINST THE MIND WHICH HAS CONCEIVED THEM: IT BECOMES THEIR VICTIM. EVERYTHING IS HOSTILE TO IT: ITS OWN SOLITUDE ITS OWN AUDACITY THE OPAQUE ABSOLUTE THE UNVERIFIABLE GODS AND THE MANIFEST NOTHINGNESS. WOE TO THE MAN WHO HAVING ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN MOMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL HAS NOT DRAWN UP SHORT! HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE THINKERS WHO MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER OF QUESTIONS WHO SET THEIR FOOT ON THE LAST RUNG THAT OF THE ABSURD HAVE BEQUEATHED TO POSTERITY ONLY AN EXAMPLE OF STERILITY WHEREAS THEIR CONFRERES STOPPING HALFWAY UP HAVE FERTILIZED THE MIND’S GROWTH; THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR KIND THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED SOME WELL-TURNED IDOL SOME POLISHED SUPERSTITIONS SOME ERRORS DISGUISED AS PRINCIPLES AND A SYSTEM OF HOPES. HAD THEY EMBRACED THE DANGERS OF AN EXCESSIVE PROGRESSION THIS SCORN OF CHARITABLE MISTAKES WOULD HAVE RENDERED THEM DISASTROUS TO OTHERS AND TO THEMSELVES; THEY WOULD HAVE INSCRIBED THEIR NAMES ON THE CONFINES OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THOUGHT—UNHEALTHY SEEKERS AND ARID REPROBATES AMATEURS OF FRUITLESS DIZZINESS HUNTERS OF DREAMS IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO DREAM. . . .

IDEAS REFRACTORY TO THE ESSENTIAL ARE THE ONLY ONES TO HAVE A PURCHASE ON MEN. WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH A REGION OF THOUGHT WHERE EVEN THE MAN WHO ASPIRES TO SETTLE BY NATURAL INCLINATION OR MORBID THIRST IS JEOPARDIZED? NO BREATHING IN A REALM ALIEN TO THE USUAL DOUBTS. AND IF CERTAIN MINDS LOCATE THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE AGREED UPON INQUIRIES IT IS BECAUSE AN INSTINCT ROOTED IN THE DEPTHS OF MATTER OR A VICE RISING OUT OF A COSMIC DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM AND HAS LED THEM TO AN ORDER OF REFLECTIONS SO EXIGENT AND SO ENORMOUS THAT DEATH ITSELF SEEMS OF NO IMPORTANCE THE ELEMENTS OF DESTINY MERE NONSENSE AND THE APPARATUS OF METAPHYSICS NO MORE THAN UTILITARIAN AND SUSPECT. THIS OBSESSION WITH A LAST FRONTIER THIS PROGRESS IN THE VOID INVOLVE THE MOST DANGEROUS FORM OF STERILITY BESIDE WHICH NOTHINGNESS ITSELF SEEMS A PROMISE OF FECUNDITY. THE MAN WHO IS DIFFICULT IN WHAT HE DOES—IN HIS TASK OR HIS ADVENTURE HAS MERELY TO TRANSPLANT HIS DEMAND FOR FINISH TO THE UNIVERSAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO BE NO LONGER ABLE TO COMPLETE EITHER HIS WORK OR HIS LIFE.

METAPHYSICAL ANGUISH DERIVES FROM THE CONDITION OF A SUPREMELY SCRUPULOUS ARTISAN WHOSE OBJECT WOULD BE NOTHING LESS THAN BEING. BY DINT OF ANALYSIS HE ACHIEVES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPOSING OF PERFECTING A MINIATURE OF THE UNIVERSE. THE ARTIST ABANDONING HIS POEM EXASPERATED BY THE INDIGENCE OF WORDS PREFIGURES THE CONFUSION OF THE MIND DISCONTENTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXISTENT. INCAPACITY TO ORGANIZE THE ELEMENTS—AS STRIPPED OF MEANING AND SAVOR AS THE WORDS WHICH EXPRESS THEM—LEADS TO THE REVELATION OF THE VOID. THUS THE RHYMER WITHDRAWS INTO SILENCE OR INTO IMPENETRABLE ARTIFICES. IN THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSE THE OVER-EXIGENT MIND SUFFERS A DEFEAT LIKE MALLARMÉ’S IN THE FACE OF ART. IT IS PANIC BEFORE AN OBJECT WHICH IS NO LONGER AN OBJECT WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE MANIPULATED FOR—IDEALLY—ITS LIMITS HAVE BEEN TRANSCENDED. THOSE WHO DO NOT REMAIN INSIDE THE REALTY THEY CULTIVATE THOSE WHO TRANSCEND THE TASK OF EXISTING MUST EITHER COMPROMISE WITH THE INESSENTIAL REVERSE GEARS AND TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE ETERNAL FARCE OR ACCEPT ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF A SEVERED CONDITION WHICH IS EITHER SUPERFETATION OR TRAGEDY DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT IS CONTEMPLATED OR ENDURED.

FELICITY OF EPIGONES
IS THERE A PLEASURE MORE SUBTLY AMBIGUOUS THAN TO WATCH THE RUIN OF A MYTH? WHAT DILAPIDATION OF HEARTS IN ORDER TO BEGET IT WHAT EXCESSES OF INTOLERANCE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT RESPECTED WHAT TERROR FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT ASSENT TO IT AND WHAT EXPENSE OF HOPES FOR THOSE WHO WATCH IT . . . EXPIRE! INTELLIGENCE FLOURISHES ONLY IN THE AGES WHEN BELIEFS WITHER WHEN THEIR ARTICLES AND THEIR PRECEPTS SLACKEN WHEN THEIR RULES COLLAPSE. EVERY PERIOD’S ENDING IS THE MIND’S PARADISE FOR THE MIND REGAINS ITS PLAY AND ITS WHIMS ONLY WITHIN AN ORGANISM IN UTTER DISSOLUTION. THE MAN WHO HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO BELONG TO A PERIOD OF CREATION AND FECUNDITY SUFFERS ITS LIMITATIONS AND ITS RUTS; SLAVE OF A UNILATERAL VISION HE IS ENCLOSED WITHIN A LIMITED HORIZON. THE MOST FERTILE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WERE AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST AIRLESS; THEY PREVAILED EKE A FATALITY A BLESSING FOR THE NAIVE MIND MORTAL TO AN AMATEUR OF INTELLECTUAL SPACE. FREEDOM HAS SCOPE ONLY AMONG THE DISABUSED AND STERILE EPIGONES AMONG THE INTELLECTS OF BELATED EPOCHS EPOCHS WHOSE STYLE IS COMING APART AND IS NO LONGER INSPIRED EXCEPT BY A CERTAIN IRONIC INDULGENCE.

TO BELONG TO A CHURCH UNCERTAIN OF ITS GOD—AFTER ONCE IMPOSING THAT GOD BY FIRE AND SWORD—SHOULD BE THE IDEAL OF EVERY DETACHED MIND. WHEN A MYTH LANGUISHES AND TURNS DIAPHANOUS AND THE INSTITUTION WHICH SUSTAINS IT TURNS CLEMENT AND TOLERANT PROBLEMS ACQUIRE A PLEASANT ELASTICITY. THE WEAK POINT OF A FAITH THE DIMINISHED DEGREE OF ITS VIGOR SET UP A TENDER VOID IN MEN’S SOULS AND RENDER THEM RECEPTIVE THOUGH WITHOUT PERMITTING THEM TO BE BLIND YET TO THE SUPERSTITIONS WHICH LIE IN WAIT FOR THE FUTURE THEY DARKEN ALREADY. THE MIND IS SOOTHED ONLY BY THOSE AGONIES OF HISTORY WHICH PRECEDE THE INSANITY OF EVERY DAWN. . . .

ULTIMATE AUDACITY
IF IT IS TRUE THAT NERO EXCLAIMED “LUCKY PRIAM WHO SAW THE RUIN OF YOUR COUNTRY!” LET US GRANT HIM THE MERIT OF HAVING ACCEDED TO A SUBLIME DEFIANCE TO THE LAST HYPOSTASIS OF THE BEAU GESTE AND LUGUBRIOUS GRANDILOQUENCE. AFTER SUCH A PHRASE SO MARVELOUSLY APPROPRIATE IN AN EMPEROR’S MOUTH ONE IS ENTITLED TO BANALITY; ONE IS EVEN COMPELLED TO IT. WHO COULD PRETEND TO FURTHER EXTRAVAGANCE? THE PETTY ACCIDENTS OF OUR TRIVIALITY FORCE US TO ADMIRE THIS CRUEL AND HISTRIONIC CAESAR (ALL THE MORE IN THAT HIS MADNESS HAS KNOWN A GLORY GREATER THAN THE SIGHS OF HIS VICTIMS WRITTEN HISTORY BEING AT LEAST AS INHUMAN AS THE EVENTS WHICH PROVOKE IT). BESIDE HIS ALL ATTITUDES SEEM ANTICS. AND IF IT IS TRUE THAT HE SET ROME ON FIRE IN IMITATION OF THE ILIAD WAS THERE EVER A MORE TANGIBLE HOMAGE TO A WORK OF ART? IN ANY CASE IT IS THE ONE EXAMPLE OF LITERARY CRITICISM AT WORK OF AN ACTIVE AESTHETIC JUDGMENT.

THE EFFECT A BOOK HAS UPON US IS REAL ONLY IF WE CRAVE TO IMITATE ITS PLOT TO KILL IF ITS HERO KILLS TO BE JEALOUS IF HE IS JEALOUS TO TAKE SICK AND DIE IF HE SUFFERS AND EXPIRES. BUT ALL THIS FOR US REMAINS IN THE POTENTIAL STATE OR DECLINES TO DEAD LETTERS; ONLY NERO GRANTS HIMSELF LITERATURE AS A SPECTACLE; HIS ACCOUNTING IS MADE WITH THE ASHES OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND OF HIS CAPITAL . . .

SUCH WORDS AND SUCH ACTIONS HAD TO BE UTTERED AND PERFORMED AT LEAST ONCE. A CRIMINAL TOOK THEM UPON HIMSELF. THIS CAN CONSOLE US INDEED IT MUST OR ELSE HOW SHOULD WE RESUME OUR CUSTOMARY BEHAVIOR AND OUR CONVENIENT AND PRUDENT TRUTHS?

EFFIGY OF THE FAILURE
HAVING A HORROR OF ANY ACTION HE KEEPS TELLING HIMSELF: “MOVEMENT WHAT FOLLY!” IT IS NOT SO MUCH EVENTS WHICH VEX HIM AS THE NOTION OF PARTICIPATING IN THEM; AND HE BESTIRS HIMSELF ONLY IN ORDER TO TURN AWAY FROM THEM. HIS SNEERS HAVE DEVASTATED LIFE BEFORE HE HAS EXHAUSTED ITS JUICE. HE IS A CROSSROADS ECCLESIAST WHO FINDS IN THE UNIVERSAL MEANINGLESSNESS AN EXCUSE FOR HIS DEFEATS. EAGER TO FIND EVERYTHING UNIMPORTANT HE SUCCEEDS EASILY THE EVIDENCE PREPONDERANT ON HIS SIDE. IN THE BATTLE OF ARGUMENTS HE IS ALWAYS THE WIENER AS HE IS ALWAYS THE LOSER IN ACTION: HE IS “RIGHT” HE REJECTS EVERYTHING—AND EVERYTHING REJECTS HIM. HE HAS PREMATURELY COMPROMISED WHAT MUST NOT BE COMPROMISED IN ORDER TO LIVE—AND SINCE HIS TALENT WAS OVER-ENLIGHTENED AS TO HIS OWN FUNCTIONS HE HAS SQUANDERED IT LEST IT DRIBBLE AWAY INTO THE INANITY OF A WORK. BEARING THE IMAGE OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS A STIGMA AND A HALO HE BLUSHES AND FLATTERS HIMSELF ON THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS STERILITY FOREVER ALIEN TO NAIVE SEDUCTIONS THE ONE FREE MAN AMONG THE HELOTS OF TIME. HE EXTRACTS HIS LIBERTY FROM THE ENORMITY OF HIS LACK OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS; HE IS AN INFINITE AND PITIABLE GOD WHOM NO CREATION LIMITS NO CREATURE WORSHIPS AND WHOM NO ONE SPARES. THE SCORN HE HAS POURED OUT ON OTHERS IS RETURNED BY THEM. HE EXPIATES ONLY THE ACTIONS HE HAS NOT PERFORMED THOUGH THEIR NUMBER EXCEEDS THE CALCULATIONS OF HIS WOUNDED PRIDE. BUT AT THE END AS A KIND OF CONSOLATION AND AT THE CLOSE OF A LIFE WITHOUT HONORS HE WEARS HIS USELESSNESS LIKE A CROWN.

("WHAT’S THE USE?"—THE FAILURE’S ADAGE THE MAXIM OF DEATH’S TIMESERVER. . . . WHAT A STIMULANT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SUFFER ITS OBSESSION! FOR DEATH BEFORE WEIGHING TOO HEAVILY UPON US ENRICHES US OUR POWERS GROW AT ITS CONTACT; THEN IT PERFORMS ITS WORK OF DESTRUCTION UPON US. THE EVIDENCE OF THE USELESSNESS OF ALL EFFORT AND THAT SENSATION OF A FUTURE CORPSE ALREADY RISING INTO THE PRESENT AND FILLING TIME’S HORIZON END BY BENUMBING OUR IDEAS OUR HOPES AND OUR MUSCLES SO THAT THE EXCESS OF ENERGY PROVOKED BY THE QUITE RECENT OBSESSION IS CONVERTED—WHEN THAT OBSESSION IS IRREVOCABLY IMPLANTED IN THE MIND—INTO A STAGNATION OF OUR VITALITY. THUS THIS OBSESSION INCITES US TO BECOME EVERYTHING AND NOTHING. NORMALLY IT SHOULD CONFRONT US WITH THE ONE CHOICE POSSIBLE: THE CONVENT OR THE CABARET. BUT WHEN WE CAN EVADE IT BY NEITHER ETERNITY NOR PLEASURES WHEN ATTACKED IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE AS FAR FROM HEAVEN AS FROM VULGARITY IT TRANSFORMS US INTO THAT KIND OF DECOMPOSED HERO WHO PROMISES EVERYTHING AND ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING: IDLE MEN WASTING THEIR BREATH IN THE VOID; VERTICAL CARRION WHOSE SOLE ACTIVITY IS REDUCED TO THINKING THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO BE. . . .)

CONDITIONS OF TRAGEDY
IF JESUS HAD ENDED HIS CAREER UPON THE CROSS IF HE HAD NOT BEEN COMMITTED TO RESUSCITATION—-WHAT A SPLENDID TRAGIC HERO! HIS DIVINE ASPECT HAS COST LITERATURE AN ADMIRABLE SUBJECT. THEREBY HE SHARES THE FATE AESTHETICALLY MEDIOCRE OF ALL JUST MEN. LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH PERPETUATES ITSELF IN MEN’S HEARTS LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH IS EXPOSED TO WORSHIP AND DOES NOT IRREMEDIABLY DIE HE DOES NOT LEND HIMSELF TO THAT VISION OF A TOTAL END WHICH MARKS OUT A TRAGIC DESTINY. FOR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY THAT JESUS HAVE NO FOLLOWERS AND THAT THE TRANSFIGURATION DID NOT COME TO RAISE HIM TO AN ILLICIT HALO. NOTHING MORE ALIEN TO TRAGEDY THAN THE NOTION OF REDEMPTION OF SALVATION AND IMMORTALITY! THE HERO SUCCUMBS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN ACTIONS WITHOUT ITS BEING GRANTED HIM TO EVADE HIS DEATH BY SOME SUPERNATURAL GRACE; HE CONTINUES—AS AN EXISTENCE—IN NO WAY WHATEVER HE REMAINS DISTINCT IN MEN’S MEMORY AS A SPECTACLE OF SUFFERING; HAVING NO DISCIPLES HIS STERILE DESTINY PROVES FRUITFUL TO NOTHING BUT OTHER PEOPLE’S IMAGINATION. MACBETH COLLAPSES WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A REDEMPTION: THERE IS NO EXTREME UNCTION IN TRAGEDY. . . .

THE NATURE OF A FAITH EVEN IF IT MUST FAIL IS TO ELUDE THE IRREPARABLE. (WHAT COULD SHAKESPEARE HAVE DONE WITH A MARTYR?) THE TRUE HERO FIGHTS AND DIES IN THE NAME OF HIS DESTINY AND NOT IN THE NAME OF A BELIEF. HIS EXISTENCE ELIMINATES ANY NOTION OF AN ESCAPE; THE PATHS WHICH DO NOT LEAD HIM TO DEATH ARE DEAD ENDS TO HIM; HE WORKS AT HIS “BIOGRAPHY"; HE TENDS TO HIS DENOUEMENT AND INSTINCTIVELY MANAGES EVERYTHING TO BRING ABOUT EVENTS FATAL TO HIMSELF FATALITY BEING HIS VITAL JUICE EVERY WAY OUT CAN BE NO MORE THAN A DISLOYALTY TO HIS DESTRUCTION. THUS THE MAN OF DESTINY IS NEVER CONVERTED TO ANY BELIEF WHATEVER: HE WOULD THEREBY SPOIL HIS END. AND IF HE WERE IMMOBILIZED ON THE CROSS IT IS NOT HE WHO WOULD RAISE HIS EYES TO HEAVEN: HIS OWN HISTORY IS HIS SOLE ABSOLUTE AS HIS WILL TO TRAGEDY IS HIS SOLE DESIRE. . . .

THE IMMANENT LIE
TO LIVE SIGNIFIES TO BELIEVE AND TO HOPE—TO LIE AND TO LIE TO ONESELF. THIS IS WHY THE MOST TRUTHFUL IMAGE EVER CREATED OF MAN REMAINS THAT OF THE KNIGHT OF THE DOLEFUL COUNTENANCE THAT DON WHOM WE FIND IN EVEN THE MOST FULFILLED OF THE SAGES. THE PAINFUL EPISODE AROUND THE CROSS AND THE OTHER MORE MAJESTIC ONE CROWNED BY NIRVANA PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME UNREALITY THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED A SYMBOLIC QUALITY DENIED BY THE SEQUEL OF THE POOR HIDALGO’S ADVENTURES. NOT ALL MEN CAN SUCCEED: THE FECUNDITY OF THEIR LIES VARIES. . . . ONE DECEPTION TRIUMPHS: THERE RESULTS A RELIGION A DOCTRINE OR A MYTH—AND A HOST OF ADEPTS; ANOTHER FAILS: THEN IT IS ONLY A DIVAGATION A THEORY OR A FICTION. ONLY INERT THINGS ADD NOTHING TO WHAT THEY ARE: A STONE DOES NOT LIE; IT INTERESTS NO ONE—WHEREAS LIFE INDEFATIGABLY INVENTS: LIFE IS THE NOVEL OF MATTER.

A DUST INFATUATED WITH GHOSTS—SUCH IS MAN: HIS ABSOLUTE IMAGE IDEALLY LIFELIKE WOULD BE INCARNATED IN A DON QUIXOTE SEEN BY AESCHYLUS. . .

(IF LIFE OCCUPIES THE FIRST PLACE IN THE HIERARCHY OF LIES LOVE COMES IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD LIE WITHIN THE LIE. EXPRESSION OF OUR HYBRID POSITION LOVE IS SURROUNDED BY AN APPARATUS OF BEATITUDES AND TORMENTS THANKS TO WHICH WE FIND IN SOMEONE A SUBSTITUTE FOR OURSELVES. BY WHAT HOAX DO TWO EYES TURN US AWAY FROM OUR SOLITUDE? IS THERE ANY FAILURE MORE HUMILIATING FOR THE MIND? LOVE LULLS KNOWLEDGE; WAKENED KNOWLEDGE KILLS LOVE. UNREALITY CANNOT TRIUMPH INDEFINITELY EVEN DISGUISED IN THE APPEARANCES OF THE MOST EXALTING LIE. AND MOREOVER WHO WOULD HAVE AN ILLUSION SOLID ENOUGH TO FIND IN THE OTHER WHAT HE HAS VAINLY SOUGHT IN HIMSELF? WOULD A FURNACE OF GUTS AFFORD WHAT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE COULD NOT GIVE US? AND YET THIS IS THE ACTUAL BASIS OF THIS COMMON AND SUPERNATURAL ANOMALY: TO SOLVE À DEUX RATHER TO SUSPEND—ALL ENIGMAS; BY MEANS OF AN IMPOSTURE TO FORGET THAT FICTION IN WHICH LIFE IS STEEPED; BY A DOUBLE MURMUR TO FILL THE GENERAL VACUITY; AND—PARODY OF ECSTASY—TO DROWN ONESELF AT LAST IN THE SWEAT OF SOME ACCOMPLICE OR OTHER. . . .)

THE COMING OF CONSCIOUSNESS
HOW MUCH OUR INSTINCTS MUST HAVE HAD TO BE BLUNTED AND THEIR FUNCTIONING SLACKENED BEFORE CONSCIOUSNESS EXTENDED ITS CONTROL OVER THE SUM OF OUR ACTIONS AND OUR THOUGHTS! THE FIRST NATURAL REACTION SUPPRESSED INVOLVED ALL THE POSTPONEMENTS OF VITAL ACTIVITY ALL OUR FAILURES IN THE IMMEDIATE. MAN—AN ANIMAL WITH RETARDED DESIRES—IS A LUCID NOTHINGNESS ENCIRCLING EVERYTHING AND ENCIRCLED BY NOTHING WHO SURVEYS ALL OBJECTS AND POSSESSES NONE.

COMPARED TO THE COMING OF CONSCIOUSNESS OTHER EVENTS ARE OF A MINOR IMPORTANCE OR NONE AT ALL. BUT THIS ADVENT IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE DATA OF LIFE CONSTITUTES A DANGEROUS EXPLOSION AT THE HEART OF THE ANIMATE WORLD A SCANDAL IN BIOLOGY. NOTHING SUGGESTED ITS IMMINENCE: NATURAL AUTOMATISM SUGGESTED NO LIKELIHOOD OF AN ANIMAL FLINGING ITSELF BEYOND MATTER. THE GORILLA LOSING ITS FOR AND REPLACING IT BY IDEALS THE GORILLA IN GLOVES FORGING GODS AGGRAVATING HIS GRIMACES AND ADORING THE HEAVENS—HOW MUCH NATURE WAS TO SUFFER AND WILL SUFFER STILL BEFORE SUCH A FALL! THIS IS BECAUSE CONSCIOUSNESS LEADS FAR AND PERMITS EVERYTHING. FOR THE ANIMAL LIFE IS AN ABSOLUTE; FOR MAN IT IS AN ABSOLUTE AND A PRETEXT. IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE THERE IS NO PHENOMENON MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS POSSIBILITY RESERVED FOR US OF CONVERTING EVERY OBJECT INTO A PRETEXT TO PLAY WITH OUR EVERYDAY UNDERTAKINGS AND OUR LAST ENDS TO PUT ON THE SAME LEVEL BY THE DIVINITY OF WHIM A GOD AND A BROOMSTICK.

AND MAN WILL BE RID OF HIS ANCESTORS—AND OF NATURE—ONLY WHEN HE HAS LIQUIDATED IN HIMSELF EVERY VESTIGE OF THE UNCONDITIONED WHEN HIS LIFE AND THAT OF OTHERS WILL SEEM NO MORE TO HIM THAN A SET OF STRINGS HE WILL PULL FOR LAUGHS IN AN AMUSEMENT FOR THE END OF TIME. THEN HE WILL BE THE PURE BEING. CONSCIOUSNESS WILL HAVE PLAYED ITS ROLE. . . .

THE ARROGANCE OF PRAYER
WHEN WE REACH THE LIMITS OF MONOLOGUE THE CONFINES OF SOLITUDE WE INVENT—FOR LACK OF ANOTHER INTERLOCUTOR—GOD SUPREME PRETEXT OF DIALOGUE. SO LONG AS YOU NAME HIM YOUR MADNESS IS WELL DISGUISED AND .. . ALL IS PERMITTED. THE TRUE BELIEVER IS SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MADMAN; BUT HIS MADNESS IS LEGAL ACKNOWLEDGED; HE WOULD END UP IN AN ASYLUM IF HIS ABERRATIONS WERE PURE OF ALL FAITH. BUT GOD COVERS THEM LEGITIMIZES THEM. THE PRIDE OF A CONQUEROR PALES BESIDE THE OSTENTATION OF A BELIEVER WHO ADDRESSES HIMSELF TO THE CREATOR. HOW CAN ONE DARE SO MUCH? AND HOW COULD MODESTY BE A VIRTUE OF TEMPLES WHEN A DECREPIT OLD WOMAN WHO IMAGINES INFINITY WITHIN REACH RAISES HERSELF BY PRAYER TO A LEVEL OF AUDACITY TO WHICH NO TYRANT HAS EVER LAID CLAIM?

I SHOULD SACRIFICE THE WORLD’S EMPIRE FOR ONE SINGLE MOMENT WHEN MY CLASPED HANDS WOULD IMPLORE THE GREAT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR RIDDLES AND OUR BANALITIES. YET THIS MOMENT CONSTITUTES THE COMMON QUALITY—AND IN A SENSE THE OFFICIAL TIME—OF ANY BELIEVER. BUT THE MAN WHO IS TRULY MODEST KEEPS REPEATING TO HIMSELF: “TOO HUMBLE TO PRAY TOO INERT TO STEP ACROSS THE CHURCH THRESHOLD I RESIGN MYSELF TO MY SHADOW AND SEEK NO CAPITULATION FROM GOD BEFORE MY PRAYERS.” AND TO THOSE WHO OFFER HIM IMMORTALITY HE REPLIES: “MY PRIDE IS NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE: ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. YOU IMAGINE IN THE NAME OF FAITH THAT YOU ARE CONQUERING YOUR SELF; IN FACT YOU SEEK TO PERPETUATE IT IN ETERNITY THIS EARTHLY DURATION BEING INSUFFICIENT FOR YOU. YOUR VAINGLORY EXCEEDS IN REFINEMENT ALL THE AMBITIONS OF THE AGE. WHAT DREAM OF FAME COMPARED TO YOURS FAILS TO TURN OUT DECEPTION AND SMOKE? YOUR FAITH IS MERELY A FOLIE DE GRANDEURS TOLERATED BY THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT HAS TAKEN DISGUISED PATHS; BUT YOUR DUST IS YOUR ONE OBSESSION: GREEDY FOR THE TIMELESS YOU PERSECUTE THE TIME WHICH DISPERSES IT. THE BEYOND ALONE IS SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOUR CRAVINGS; THE EARTH AND ITS MOMENTS SEEM TOO FRAGILE FOR YOU. THE MEGALOMANIA OF MONASTERIES EXCEEDS ALL THAT THE SUMPTUOUS FEVERS OF PALACES EVER IMAGINED. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ASSENT TO HIS NOTHINGNESS IS MENTALLY DISEASED. AND THE BELIEVER OF ALL MEN IS THE LEAST DISPOSED TO ASSENT TO IT. THE WILL TO ENDURE PUSHED TO SUCH LENGTHS TERRIFIES ME. I REJECT THE MORBID SEDUCTION OF AN INDEFINITE ME .. . I WANT TO WALLOW IN MY MORTALITY. I WANT TO REMAIN NORMAL.”

(LORD GIVE ME THE CAPACITY OF NEVER PRAYING SPARE ME THE INSANITY OF ALL WORSHIP LET THIS TEMPTATION OF LOVE PASS FROM ME WHICH WOULD DELIVER ME FOREVER UNTO YOU. LET THE VOID SPREAD BETWEEN MY HEART AND HEAVEN! I HAVE NO DESIRE TO PEOPLE MY DESERTS BY YOUR PRESENCE TO TYRANNIZE MY NIGHTS BY YOUR LIGHT TO DISSOLVE MY SIBERIAS BENEATH YOUR SUN. LONELIER THAN YOU I WANT MY HANDS PURE THE CONTRARY OF YOURS WHICH WERE FOREVER CORRUPTED BY KNEADING THE EARTH AND BUSYING THEMSELVES WITH THE WORLD’S AFFAIRS. I ASK YOUR STUPID OMNIPOTENCE FOR NOTHING BUT THE RESPECT OF MY SOLITUDE AND MY TORMENTS. WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOUR WORDS? AND I FEAR THE MADNESS WHICH WOULD MAKE ME HEAR THEM. GRANT ME THE MIRACLE GATHERED BEFORE THE FIRST MOMENT THE PEACE WHICH YOU COULD NOT TOLERATE AND WHICH INCITED YOU TO BREACH THE NOTHINGNESS IN ORDER TO MAKE WAY FOR THIS CARNIVAL OF TIME AND THEREBY TO CONDEMN ME TO THE UNIVERSE—TO HUMILIATION AND THE SHAME OF BEING.)

LYPEMANIA
WHY DO YOU LACK THE STRENGTH TO ESCAPE THE OBLIGATION TO BREATHE? WHY STILL ENDURE THAT SOLIDIFIED AIR WHICH CLOGS YOUR LUNGS AND CRUSHES YOUR FLESH? HOW VANQUISH THESE OPAQUE HOPES AND THESE PETRIFIED IDEAS WHEN TURN AND TURN ABOUT YOU IMITATE THE SOLIDIFIED OF A CRAG OR THE ISOLATION OF A WAD OF SPITTLE FROZEN ON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD? YOU ARE FARTHER FROM YOURSELF THAN AN UNDISCOVERED PLANET AND YOUR ORGANS TURNED TOWARD THE GRAVEYARDS ENVY THEIR DYNAMISM. . . .

OPEN YOUR VEINS IN ORDER TO FLOOD THIS PAGE WHICH INFURIATES YOU THE WAY THE SEASONS DO? ABSURD EFFORT! YOUR BLOOD FADED BY WHITE NIGHTS HAS SUSPENDED ITS FLOW. . . . NOTHING WILL WAKEN IN YOU THE NEED FOR LIVING AND DYING EXTINGUISHED BY THE YEARS FOREVER SLAKED BY THOSE SPRINGS WITHOUT MURMUR OR PRESTIGE AT WHICH MEN QUENCH THEIR THIRST. MONSTER WITH MUTE DRY LIPS YOU WILL REMAIN BEYOND THE SOUNDS OF LIFE AND DEATH BEYOND EVEN THE SOUND OF TEARS. . . .

(THE TRUE GREATNESS OF THE SAINTS CONSISTS IN THAT INCOMPARABLE POWER OF DEFEATING THE FEAR OF RIDICULE. WE CANNOT WEEP WITHOUT SHAME; THEY INVOKED THE “GIFT OF TEARS.” A PREOCCUPATION WITH HONOR IN OUR “DRYNESS” IMMOBILIZES US INTO THE SPECTATORS OF OUR BITTER AND REPRESSED INFINITY OUR STREAMS THAT DO NOT FLOW. YET THE EYES' FUNCTION IS NOT TO SEE BUT TO WEEP; AND REALLY TO SEE WE MUST CLOSE THEM: THAT IS THE CONDITION OF ECSTASY OF THE ONE REVEALING VISION WHEREAS PERCEPTION IS EXHAUSTED IN THE HORROR OF THE DÉJÁ VU OF AN IRREPARABLE RECOGNITION SCENE WHICH OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING. . . .

FOR THE MAN WHO HAS FORESEEN THE WORLD’S FUTILE DISASTERS AND TO WHOM KNOWLEDGE HAS AFFORDED ONLY THE CONFIRMATION OF AN INNATE DISENCHANTMENT THE SCRUPLES WHICH KEEP HIM FROM WEEPING ACCENTUATE HIS PREDESTINATION TO MELANCHOLY. AND IF HE ACTUALLY ENVIES THE SAINTS” EXPLOITS IT IS NOT SO MUCH FOR THEIR DISGUST WITH APPEARANCES OR THEIR TRANSCENDENT APPETITE BUT RATHER FOR THEIR VICTORY OVER THAT FEAR OF RIDICULE WHICH HE CANNOT AVOID AND WHICH KEEPS HIM ON THIS SIDE OF THE SUPERNATURAL INDECORUM OF TEARS.)

EVERYDAY CURSE
TO REPEAT TO YOURSELF A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY: “NOTHING ON EARTH HAS ANY WORTH” TO KEEP FINDING YOURSELF AT THE SAME POINT TO CIRCLE STUPIDLY AS A TOP ETERNALLY. . . . FOR THERE IS NO PROGRESSION IN THE NOTION OF UNIVERSAL VANITY NOR CONCLUSION; AND AS FAR AS WE VENTURE IN SUCH RUMINATIONS OUR KNOWLEDGE MAKES NO GAIN: IT IS IN ITS PRESENT STATE AS RICH AND AS VOID AS AT ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE IT IS A SURCEASE WITHIN THE INCURABLE A LEPROSY OF THE MIND A REVELATION BY STUPOR. A SIMPLE-MINDED PERSON AN IDIOT WHO HAS EXPERIENCED AN ILLUMINATION AND GROWN USED TO IT WITH NO MEANS OF LEAVING IT BEHIND OF RECOVERING HIS VAGUE AND COMFORTABLE CONDITION-—SUCH IS THE STATE OF THE MAN WHO FINDS HIMSELF COMMITTED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TO THE PERCEPTION OF UNIVERSAL FUTILITY. ABANDONED BY HIS NIGHTS VIRTUALLY A VICTIM OF A LUCIDITY WHICH SMOTHERS HIM WHAT IS HE TO DO WITH THIS DAY WHICH NEVER MANAGES TO END? WHEN WILL THE LIGHT STOP SHEDDING ITS BEAMS DEADLY TO THE MEMORY OF A NIGHT WORLD ANTERIOR TO ALL THAT WAS? HOW FAR AWAY CHAOS IS RESTFUL AND CALM THE CHAOS DATING FROM BEFORE THE TERRIBLE CREATION OR SWEETER STILL THE CHAOS OF MENTAL NOTHINGNESS!

DEFENSE OF CORRUPTION
IF WE PUT IN ONE PAN THE EVIL THE “PURE” HAVE POURED OUT UPON THE WORLD AND IN THE OTHER THE EVIL THAT HAS COME FROM MEN WITHOUT PRINCIPLES AND WITHOUT SCRUPLES THE SCALE WOULD TIP TOWARD THE FIRST.

IN THE MIND THAT PROPOSES IT EVERY RECIPE FOR SALVATION ERECTS A GUILLOTINE. . . . THE DISASTERS OF CORRUPT PERIODS HAVE LESS GRAVITY THAN THE SCOURGES CAUSED BY THE ARDENT ONES; MUD IS MORE AGREEABLE THAN BLOOD; AND THERE IS MORE MILDNESS IN VICE THAN IN VIRTUE MORE HUMANITY IN DEPRAVITY THAN IN AUSTERITY. THE MAN WHO RULES AND BELIEVES IN NOTHING—BEHOLD THE MODEL OF A PARADISE OF FORFEITURE A SOVEREIGN SOLUTION TO HISTORY. OPPORTUNISTS HAVE SAVED NATIONS; HEROES HAVE RUINED THEM. TO FEEL THAT ONE IS A CONTEMPORARY NOT OF THE REVOLUTION AND OF BONAPARTE BUT OF FOUCHÉ AND OF TALLEYRAND: THE ONLY THING LACKING IN THE LATTERS’ VERSATILITY WAS A DROP OF MELANCHOLY FOR THEM TO SUGGEST BY THEIR ACTIONS A WHOLE ART OF LIVING.

IT IS THE DISSOLUTE AGES WHICH CAN CLAIM THE MERIT OF LAYING BARE THE ESSENCE OF LIFE OF SHOWING US THAT EVERYTHING IS ONLY-FARCE OR GALL—AND THAT NO EVENT IS WORTH BEING TOUCHED UP: IT IS NECESSARILY EXECRABLE. THE EMBELLISHED LIE OF THE GREAT PERIODS OF THIS CENTURY THAT KING THAT POPE. . . . THE “TRUTH” APPEARS ONLY AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN MEN’S MINDS FORGETTING THE CONSTRUCTIVE DELIRIUM LET THEMSELVES SLIP BACK INTO THE DISSOLUTION OF MORALS OF IDEALS AND OF BELIEFS. TO KNOW IS TO SEE; IT IS NEITHER TO HOPE NOR TO TRY.

THE STUPIDITY WHICH CHARACTERIZES HISTORY’S PEAKS HAS NO EQUIVALENT BUT THE INEPTITUDE OF THOSE WHO ARE ITS AGENTS. IT IS OUT OF A LACK OF FINESSE THAT WE CARRY OUR ACTIONS AND OUR THOUGHTS TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS. A DETACHED MIND SHRINKS FROM TRAGEDY AND APOTHEOSIS: DISGRACES AND PALMS EXASPERATE SUCH A SPIRIT AS MUCH AS BANALITY. TO GO TOO FAR IS TO GIVE AN INFALLIBLE PROOF OF BAD TASTE. THE AESTHETE HAS A HORROR OF BLOOD SUBLIMITY AND HEROES. . . . HE STILL VALUES ONLY THE DISSIPATED. . . .

THE OBSOLETE UNIVERSE
THE AGING PROCESS IN THE VERBAL UNIVERSE FOLLOWS A MUCH MORE ACCELERATED RHYTHM THAN IN THE MATERIAL ONE. WORDS TOO OFTEN REPEATED WEAKEN AND DIE WHEREAS MONOTONY CONSTITUTES THE VERY LAW OF MATTER. THE MIND SHOULD HAVE AN INFINITE DICTIONARY BUT ITS MEANS ARE LIMITED TO A FEW EXPRESSIONS TRIVIALIZED BY USAGE. HENCE THE NEW REQUIRING STRANGE COMBINATIONS FORCES WORDS INTO UNEXPECTED FUNCTIONS: ORIGINALITY IS REDUCED TO THE TORMENT OF THE ADJECTIVE AND TO THE SUGGESTIVE IMPROPRIETY OF METAPHOR. PUT WORDS IN THEIR PLACE: THAT IS THE EVERYDAY GRAVEYARD OF SPEECH. WHAT IS CONSECRATED IN A LANGUAGE CONSTITUTES ITS DEATH: AN ANTICIPATED WORD IS A DEFUNCT ONE; ONLY ITS ARTIFICIAL USE IMBUES IT WITH A NEW VIGOR UNTIL IT IS COMMONLY ADOPTED WORN CORRUPTED. . . . THE MIND IS PRECIOUS—OR IT IS NOT THE MIND WHEREAS NATURE LOLLS IN THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS ALWAYS IDENTICAL MEANS.

WHAT WE CALL OUR LIFE IN RELATION TO “LIFE” IS AN INCESSANT CREATION OF VOGUES WITH THE HELP OF AN ARTIFICIALLY MANIPULATED SPEECH; IT IS A PROLIFERATION OF FUTILITIES WITHOUT WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE TO EXPIRE IN A YAWN THAT WOULD ENGULF HISTORY AND MATTER ALIKE. IF MAN INVENTS A NEW PHYSICS IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO ARRIVE AT A VALID EXPLANATION OF NATURE AS TO ESCAPE THE BOREDOM OF THE UNDERSTOOD HABITUAL VULGARLY IRREDUCIBLE UNIVERSE TO WHICH HE ARBITRARILY ATTRIBUTES AS MANY DIMENSIONS AS WE PROJECT ADJECTIVES UPON AN INERT THING WE ARE TIRED OF SEEING AND SUFFERING AS IT WAS SEEN AND SUFFERED BY DIE STUPIDITY OF OUR ANCESTORS OR OF OUR IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS. WOE TO THE MAN WHO HAVING UNDERSTOOD THIS MASQUERADE WITHDRAWS FROM IT! HE WILL HAVE ENCROACHED UPON THE SECRET OF HIS VITALITY—AND HE WILL JOIN THE MOTIONLESS UNAFFECTED TRUTH OF THOSE IN WHOM THE WELLSPRINGS OF THE PRECIOUS HAVE DRIED UP AND WHOSE MIND IS ETIOLATED FOR WANT OF THE ARTIFICIAL.

(IT IS ONLY TOO LEGITIMATE TO IMAGINE THE MOMENT WHEN LIFE WILL NO LONGER BE THE FASHION WHEN IT WILL FALL INTO DESUETUDE LIKE THE MOON OR TUBERCULOSIS AFTER THE ABUSES OF ROMANTICISM: LIFE WILL THEN CROWN THE ANACHRONISM OF THE DENUDED SYMBOLS AND THE UNMASKED DISEASES; IT WILL ONCE AGAIN BECOME ITSELF: AN ILL WITHOUT PRESTIGE A FATALITY WITHOUT LUSTER. AND THAT MOMENT IS ONLY TOO FORESEEABLE WHEN NO HOPE WILL REAPPEAR IN MEN’S HEARTS WHEN THE EARTH WILL BE AS GLACIAL AS ITS CREATURES WHEN NO DREAM WILL COME BACK TO EMBELLISH THE STERILE IMMENSITY OF IT ALL. HUMANITY WILL BLUSH TO BEGET WHEN IT SEES THINGS AS THEY ARE. LIFE WITHOUT THE SAP OF MISTAKES AND DECEPTIONS LIFE CEASING TO BE A VOGUE WILL FIND NO CLEMENCY AT THE MIND’S TRIBUNAL. BUT FINALLY THAT MIND ITSELF WILL GIVE WAY: IT IS ONLY AN EXCUSE IN THE VOID AS LIFE IS ONLY A PREJUDICE.

HISTORY SUSTAINS ITSELF AS LONG AS ABOVE OUR TRANSITORY FASHIONS OF WHICH EVENTS ARE THE SHADOW A MORE GENERAL FASHION FLOATS LIKE A CONSTANT; BUT WHEN THIS CONSTANT IS GENERALLY EXPOSED AS A SIMPLE WHIM WHEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISTAKE OF LIVING BECOMES COMMON PROPERTY AND UNANIMOUS TRUTH WHERE SHALL WE SEEK RESOURCES IN ORDER TO ENGENDER OR EVEN TO SKETCH OUT AN ACTION THE SIMULACRUM OF A GESTURE? BY WHAT ART SURVIVE OUR LUCID INSTINCTS AND OUR PERSPICACIOUS HEARTS? BY WHAT MIRACLE REANIMATE A FUTURE TEMPTATION IN AN OBSOLETE UNIVERSE?)

DECREPIT MAN
I NO LONGER WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LIGHT OR USE THE JARGON OF LIFE. AND I SHALL NO LONGER SAY “I AM” WITHOUT BLUSHING. THE IMMODESTY OF THE BREATH THE SCANDAL OF THE LUNGS ARE LINKED TO THE ABUSE OF AN AUXILIARY VERB. . . .

THE TIME IS PAST WHEN MAN THOUGHT OF HIMSELF IN TERMS OF A DAWN; BEHOLD HIM RESTING ON AN ANEMIC MATTER OPEN TO HIS TRUE DUTY THE DUTY OF STUDYING HIS LOSS AND OF RUSHING INTO IT . . . BEHOLD HIM ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW EPOCH: THE EPOCH OF SELF-PITY. AND THIS PITY IS HIS SECOND FALL MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HUMILIATING THAN THE FIRST: IT IS A FALL WITHOUT REDEMPTION. VAINLY HE INSPECTS THE HORIZONS: A THOUSAND SAVIORS ARE SILHOUETTED THERE HUMBUG SAVIORS THEMSELVES UNCONSOLED. HE TURNS AWAY IN ORDER TO PREPARE HIMSELF IN HIS OVERRIPE SOUL FOR THE SWEETNESS OF CORRUPTION. . . . HAVING REACHED THE INTIMACY OF HIS AUTUMN HE WAVERS BETWEEN APPEARANCE AND NOTHINGNESS BETWEEN THE DECEPTIVE FORM OF BEING AND ITS ABSENCE: VIBRATION BETWEEN TWO UNREALITIES. . . .

CONSCIOUSNESS OCCUPIES THE VOID WHICH FOLLOWS THE MIND’S EROSION OF EXISTENCE. IT TAKES THE OBNUBILATION OF AN IDIOT OR A BELIEVER TO PARTICIPATE IN “REALITY” WHICH COLLAPSES AT THE APPROACH OF THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT A SUSPICION OF IMPROBABILITY OR A SHUDDER OF ANGUISH—SO MANY RUDIMENTS WHICH PREFIGURE CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHICH ONCE DEVELOPED BEGET IT DEFINE AND EXASPERATE IT. UNDER THE EFFECT OF THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS INCURABLE PRESENCE MAN GAINS ACCESS TO HIS HIGHEST PRIVILEGE: THAT OF DESTROYING HIMSELF. NATURE’S PRIVILEGED PATIENT MAN CORRUPTS HER SAP; ABSTRACT VICE OF THE INSTINCTS HE DESTROYS THEIR VIGOR. THE UNIVERSE WITHERS AT HIS TOUCH AND TIME DECAMPS. . . . HE COULD FULFILL HIMSELF—AND DESCEND THE FURTHER SLOPE—ONLY ON THE WRECK OF THE ELEMENTS. HIS WORK COMPLETED HE IS RIPE FOR DISAPPEARANCE; THROUGH HOW MANY CENTURIES MORE WILL HIS DEATH RATTLE SOUND?


THE SECOND-HAND THINKER
THE SECOND-HAND THINKER—ADVANTAGES OF DEBILITY—THE PARASITE OF POETS—TRIBULATIONS OF AN ALIEN—ENNUI OF CONQUERORS—MUSIC AND SKEPTICISM—THE AUTOMATON—ON MELANCHOLY—THE THIRST FOR POWER—POSITION OF THE POOR.

IDEAS ARE SUBSTITUTES FOR GRIEFS.

—MARCEL PROUST

THE SECOND-HAND THINKER
I LIVE IN EXPECTATION OF THE IDEA; I FORESEE IT CLOSE IN UPON IT GET A GRIP—AND CANNOT FORMULATE IT IT ESCAPES ME DOES NOT YET BELONG TO ME: MIGHT I HAVE CONCEIVED IT IN MY ABSENCE? AND HOW ONCE IMMINENT AND VAGUE TO MAKE IT PRESENT AND LUMINOUS IN THE INTELLIGIBLE AGONY OF EXPRESSION? WHAT CONDITIONS SHOULD I HOPE FOR IF IT IS TO BLOOM—AND DECAY?

ANTI-PHILOSOPHER I ABHOR EVERY INDIFFERENT IDEA: I AM NOT ALWAYS DESPONDENT HENCE I DO NOT ALWAYS THINK. WHEN I CONSIDER IDEAS THEY SEEM EVEN MORE USELESS THAN THINGS; HENCE I HAVE LOVED ONLY THE ELUCUBRATIONS OF THE GREAT INVALIDS THE RUMINATIONS OF INSOMNIA THE FLASHES OF AN INCURABLE FEAR AND THE DOUBTS INTERSECTED BY SIGHS. THE AMOUNT OF CHIAROSCURO AN IDEA HARBORS IS THE ONLY INDEX OF ITS PROFUNDITY AS THE DESPAIRING ACCENT OF ITS PLAYFULNESS IS THE INDEX OF ITS FASCINATION. HOW MANY WHITE NIGHTS DOES YOUR NOCTURNAL PAST CONCEAL? THAT IS HOW WE OUGHT TO CONFRONT EVERY THINKER. THE MAN WHO THINKS WHEN HE WANTS TO HAS NOTHING TO TELL US: ABOVE—OR RATHER ALONGSIDE—HIS THOUGHTS HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM NOT COMMITTED TO THEM NEITHER WINS NOR LOSES BY RISKING HIMSELF IN A STRUGGLE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF IS NOT HIS OWN ENEMY. IT COSTS HIM NOTHING TO BELIEVE IN TRUTH. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR A MIND WHERE TRUE AND FALSE HAVE CEASED TO BE SUPERSTITIONS; DESTROYER OF ALL CRITERIA SUCH A MIND VERIFIES ITSELF LIKE INVALIDS AND POETS; IT THINKS BY ACCIDENT: THE GLORY OF A DISCOMFORT OR OF A DELIRIUM SUFFICES. IS NOT AN INDIGESTION RICHER IN IDEAS THAN A PARADE OF CONCEPTS? MALFUNCTIONS OF OUR ORGANS DETERMINE THE FRUITFULNESS OF OUR MINDS: THE MAN WHO DOES NOT FEEL HIS BODY WILL NEVER BE IN A POSITION TO CONCEIVE A LIVING THOUGHT; HE WILL WAIT TO NO PURPOSE FOR THE ADVANTAGEOUS SURPRISE OF SOME DISADVANTAGE. . . .

IN AFFECTIVE INDIFFERENCE IDEAS ASSUME A PROFILE; YET NONE CAN TAKE SHAPE: IT IS UP TO MELANCHOLY TO AFFORD A CLIMATE TO THEIR BLOSSOMING. THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN TONALITY A CERTAIN COLOR IN ORDER TO VIBRATE TO SHINE. TO BE STERILE A LONG TIME IS TO LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM TO YEARN FOR THEM WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPROMISE THEM IN A FORMULA. THE MIND’S “SEASONS” ARE CONDITIONED BY AN ORGANIC RHYTHM; IT IS NOT UP TO “ME” TO BE NAIVE OR CYNICAL: MY TRUTHS ARE THE SOPHISMS OF MY ENTHUSIASM OR OF MY DEJECTION. I EXIST I FEEL AND I THINK ACCORDING TO THE MOMENT—AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF. TIME CONSTITUTES ME; IN VAIN I OPPOSE MYSELF—AND / AM. MY UNDESIRED PRESENT UNFOLDS UNFOLDS ME; UNABLE TO COMMAND IT I COMMENT UPON IT; SLAVE OF MY THOUGHTS I PLAY WITH THEM FATALITY’S BUFFOON. . . .

ADVANTAGES OF DEBILITY
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO FAILS TO TRANSCEND HIS QUALITY AS A SPLENDID EXAMPLE A FINISHED MODEL AND WHOSE EXISTENCE IS IDENTIFIED WITH HIS VITAL DESTINY LOCATES HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE MIND. IDEAL MASCULINITY—OBSTACLE TO THE PERCEPTION OF NUANCE—INVOLVES AN INSENSITIVITY TO THE ASPECT OF THE EVERYDAY SUPERNATURAL FROM WHICH ART DRAWS ITS SUBSTANCE. THE MORE ONE IS A NATURE THE LESS ONE IS AN ARTIST. HOMOGENEOUS UNDIFFERENTIATED OPAQUE VIGOR WAS IDOLIZED BY THE WORLD OF LEGENDS BY THE FANTASIES OF MYTHOLOGY. WHEN THE GREEKS TURNED TO SPECULATION THE CULT OF THE ANEMIC EPHEBE REPLACED THAT OF THE GIANTS; AND THE HEROES THEMSELVES SUBLIME DOLTS IN HOMER’S TIME BECAME THANKS TO TRAGEDY BEARERS OF TORMENTS AND DOUBTS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR ROUGH NATURE.

INTERNAL WEALTH RESULTS FROM CONFLICTS SUSTAINED WITHIN ONESELF; NOW THE VITALITY WHICH IS ENTIRELY SELF-POSSESSED KNOWS ONLY EXTERNAL STRUGGLE THE ATTACK UPON THE OBJECT. IN THE MALE WEAKENED BY A DOSE OF FEMININITY TWO TENDENCIES ARE AT GRIPS: BY WHAT IS PASSIVE IN HIMSELF HE APPREHENDS A WHOLE WORLD OF RELINQUISHMENT; BY WHAT IS IMPERIOUS HE CONVERTS HIS WILL INTO LAW. AS LONG AS HIS INSTINCTS REMAIN UNSLAKED HE CONCERNS ONLY THE SPECIES; ONCE A SECRET DISSATISFACTION CREEPS IN HE BECOMES A CONQUEROR. THE MIND JUSTIFIES EXPLAINS AND EXCUSES HIM AND CLASSIFYING HIM AMONG THE SUPERIOR SIMPLETONS ABANDONS HIM TO HISTORY’S CURIOSITY—THE INVESTIGATION OF STUPIDITY IN ACTION. . . .

THE MAN WHOSE EXISTENCE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DISEASE BOTH VIGOROUS AND VAGUE CAN NEVER ESTABLISH HIMSELF AMONG PROBLEMS NOR KNOW THEIR DANGERS. THE CONDITION FAVORABLE TO THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH OR FOR EXPRESSION IS TO BE FOUND HALFWAY BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN: THE GAPS IN “VIRILITY” ARE THE SEAT OF THE MIND. . . . IF THE PURE FEMALE WHOM WE CAN ACCUSE OF NO SEXUAL OR PSYCHIC ANOMALY IS INTERNALLY EMPTIER THAN AN ANIMAL THE INTACT MALE FITS THE DEFINITION OF “CRETIN.” CONSIDER ANY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION OR ROUSED YOUR FERVOR: SOMETHING IN HIS MECHANISM HAS BEEN UNHINGED TO HIS ADVANTAGE. WE RIGHTLY SCORN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT MADE USE OF THEIR DEFECTS WHO HAVE NOT EXPLOITED THEIR DEFICIENCIES AND HAVE NOT BEEN ENRICHED BY THEIR LOSSES AS WE DESPISE ANY MAN WHO DOES NOT SUFFER AT BEING A MAN OR SIMPLY AT BEING. HENCE NO GRAVER INSULT CAN BE INFLICTED THAN TO CALL SOMEONE “HAPPY” NO GREATER FLATTERY THAN TO GRANT HIM A “VEIN OF MELANCHOLY". . . . THIS IS BECAUSE GAIETY IS LINKED TO NO IMPORTANT ACTION AND BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR THE MAD NO ONE LAUGHS WHEN HE IS ALONE.

“INNER LIFE” IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE DELICATE THOSE TREMULOUS WRETCHES SUBJECT TO AN EPILEPSY WITH NEITHER FROTH NOR FALLING: THE BIOLOGICALLY SOUND BEING SCORNS “DEPTH” IS INCAPABLE OF IT SEES IN IT A SUSPECT DIMENSION WHICH JEOPARDIZES THE SPONTANEITY OF HIS ACTIONS. NOR IS HE MISTAKEN: WITH THE RETREAT INTO THE SELF BEGINS THE INDIVIDUAL’S DRAMA—HIS GLORY AND HIS DECLINE; ISOLATED FROM THE ANONYMOUS FLUX FROM THE UTILITARIAN TRICKLE OF LIFE HE FREES HIMSELF FROM OBJECTIVE GOALS. A CIVILIZATION IS “AFFECTED” WHEN ITS DELICATE MEMBERS SET THE TONE FOR IT; BUT THANKS TO THEM IT HAS DEFINITIVELY TRIUMPHED OVER NATURE—AND COLLAPSES. AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF REFINEMENT UNITES IN HIMSELF THE EXALTÉ AND THE SOPHIST: HE NO LONGER ADHERES TO HIS IMPULSES CULTIVATES WITHOUT CREDITING THEM; THIS IS THE OMNISCIENT DEBILITY OF TWILIGHT AGES PREFIGURATION OF MAN’S ECLIPSE. THE DELICATE ALLOW US TO GLIMPSE THE MOMENT WHEN JANITORS WILL BE TORMENTED BY AESTHETES' SCRUPLES; WHEN FARMERS BENT DOUBLE BY DOUBTS WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE VIGOR TO GUIDE THE PLOW; WHEN EVERY HUMAN BEING GNAWED BY LUCIDITY AND DRAINED OF INSTINCTS WILL BE WIPED OUT WITHOUT THE STRENGTH TO REGRET THE FLOURISHING DARKNESS OF THEIR ILLUSIONS. . . .

THE PARASITE OF POETS
I. THERE CAN BE NO ISSUE IN A POET’S LIFE. IT IS FROM EVERYTHING HE HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN FROM ALL THE MOMENTS FED ON THE INACCESSIBLE THAT HIS POWER COMES TO HIM. IF HE FINDS EXISTENCE A DISADVANTAGE HIS EXPRESSIVE FACULTIES ARE THEREBY REINFORCED HIS INSPIRATION DILATED.

A BIOGRAPHY IS LEGITIMATE ONLY IF IT FOCUSES THE ELASTICITY OF A FATE THE SUM OF VARIABLES IT CONTAINS. BUT THE POET FOLLOWS A LINE OF FATALITY WHOSE RIGOR NOTHING INFLECTS. LIFE BELONGS TO DOLTS; AND IT IS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THE LIFE THEY HAVE NOT HAD THAT WE HAVE INVENTED THE LIVES OF THE POETS. . . .

POETRY EXPRESSES THE ESSENCE OF WHAT CANNOT BE POSSESSED; ITS ULTIMATE MEANING: THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ALL “ACTUALITY.” JOY IS NOT A POETIC SENTIMENT (THOUGH IT PROCEEDS FROM A SECTOR OF THE LYRIC UNIVERSE IN WHICH CHANCE UNITES IN ONE AND THE SAME BUNDLE FLAMES AND FATUITIES). WHO HAS EVER READ A SONG OF HOPE WHICH FAILED TO INSPIRE A SENSATION OF DISCOMFORT EVEN OF DISGUST? AND HOW SING A PRESENCE WHEN THE POSSIBLE ITSELF IS SHADOWED WITH VULGARITY? BETWEEN POETRY AND HOPE COMPLETE INCOMPATIBILITY: HENCE THE POET IS A PREY TO AN ARDENT DECOMPOSITION. WHO WOULD DARE TO WONDER HOW HE HAS EXPERIENCED LIFE WHEN IT IS BY DEATH THAT HE HAS BEEN ALIVE AT ALL? WHEN HE SUCCUMBS TO THE TEMPTATION OF HAPPINESS—HE BELONGS TO COMEDY. . . . BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND FLAMES SPRING UP FROM HIS WOUNDS AND HE SINGS FELICITY—THAT VOLUPTUOUS INCANDESCENCE OF WOE—HE RESCUES HIMSELF FROM THE NUANCE OF VULGARITY INHERENT IN ANY POSITIVE ACCENT. THUS A HÖLDERLIN WITHDRAWING TO A DREAM GREECE AND TRANSFIGURING LOVE BY PURER INTOXICATIONS BY THOSE OF UNREALITY. . . .

THE POET WOULD BE AN ODIOUS DESERTER OF REALITY IF IN HIS FLIGHT HE FAILED TO TAKE HIS SUFFERING ALONE. UNLIKE THE MYSTIC OR THE SAGE HE CANNOT ESCAPE HIMSELF NOR LEAVE THE STAGE OF HIS OWN OBSESSION: EVEN HIS ECSTASIES ARE INCURABLE AND HARBINGERS OF DISASTERS. UNABLE TO RUN AWAY FOR HIM EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE EXCEPT LIFE. . . .

II. THIS IS HOW I RECOGNIZE AN AUTHENTIC POET: BY FREQUENTING HIM LIVING A LONG TIME IN THE INTIMACY OF HIS WORK SOMETHING CHANGES IN MYSELF: NOT SO MUCH MY INCLINATIONS OR MY TASTES AS MY VERY BLOOD AS IF A SUBTLE DISEASE HAD BEEN INJECTED TO ALTER ITS COURSE ITS DENSITY AND NATURE. VALÉRY AND STEFAN GEORGE LEAVE US WHERE WE PICKED THEM UP OR ELSE MAKE US MORE DEMANDING ON THE FORMAL LEVEL OF THE MIND: THEY ARE GENIUSES WE HAVE NO NEED OF THEY ARE MERELY ARTISTS. BUT A SHELLEY BUT A BAUDELAIRE BUT A RILKE INTERVENE IN THE DEEPEST PART OF OUR ORGANISM WHICH ANNEXES THEM AS IT WOULD A VICE. IN THEIR VICINITY A BODY IS FORTIFIED THEN WEAKENS AND DISINTEGRATES. FOR THE POET IS AN AGENT OF DESTRUCTION A VIRUS A DISGUISED DISEASE AND THE GRAVEST DANGER THOUGH A WONDERFULLY VAGUE ONE FOR OUR RED CORPUSCLES. TO LIVE AROUND HIM IS TO FEEL YOUR BLOOD RUN THIN TO DREAM A PARADISE OF ANEMIA AND TO HEAR IN YOUR VEINS THE RUSTLE OF TEARS. . . .

III. WHEREAS VERSE PERMITS EVERYTHING—YOU CAN POUR INTO IT TEARS SHAMES ECSTASIES COMPLAINTS ABOVE ALL—PROSE FORBIDS YOU TO GIVE VENT TO LAMENT: ITS CONVENTIONAL ABSTRACTION IS OPPOSED TO OVERFLOWING. PROSE REQUIRES OTHER TRUTHS: VERIFIABLE DEDUCED MEASURED. BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE TO STEAL THOSE OF POETRY IF YOU PILLAGED ITS SUBSTANCE AND DARED AS MUCH AS THE POETS? WHY NOT INSINUATE INTO DISCOURSE THEIR INDECENCIES THEIR HUMILIATIONS THEIR GRIMACES AND THEIR SIGHS? WHY NOT BE DECOMPOSED ROTTEN CORPSE ANGEL OR SATAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE VULGAR AND PATHETICALLY BETRAY SO MANY AERIAL AND SINISTER MOODS? MUCH MORE THAN IN THE SCHOOL OF THE PHILOSOPHERS IT IS IN THE ACADEMY OF POETS THAT WE LEARN THE COURAGE OF INTELLIGENCE AND THE AUDACITY TO BE OURSELVES. THEIR “AFFIRMATIONS” OUTDO THE MOST STRANGELY IMPERTINENT SAYINGS OF THE ANCIENT SOPHISTS. NO ONE ADOPTS THEM: HAS THERE EVER BEEN A SINGLE THINKER WHO WENT AS FAR AS BAUDELAIRE OR WHO STEELED HIMSELF TO SYSTEMATIZE A LEAR’S HOWL HAMLET’S SOLILOQUY? NIETZSCHE PERHAPS BEFORE HIS END BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE KEPT HARPING ON HIS PROPHET’S STRING. . . . AND IF WE LOOKED AMONG THE SAINTS? CERTAIN FRENZIES OF TERESA OF AVILA OR ANGELA OF FOLIGNO. . . . BUT HERE WE MEET GOD TOO FREQUENTLY—GOD THAT CONSOLING BLANK WHO REINFORCING THEIR COURAGE DIMINISHES ITS QUALITY. TO ADVANCE WITHOUT CONVICTIONS AND ALONE AMONG THE TRUTHS IS NOT GIVEN TO A MAN NOR EVEN TO A SAINT; SOMETIMES THOUGH TO A POET. . . .

I CAN IMAGINE A THINKER EXCLAIMING IN AN IMPULSE OF PRIDE: “I’D LIKE A POET TO MAKE HIS FATE OUT OF MY THOUGHTS!” BUT FOR SUCH AN ASPIRATION TO BE LEGITIMATE HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FREQUENTED THE POETS A LONG TIME HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BORROWED FROM THEM THE JOYS OF MALEDICTION AND GIVEN BACK ABSTRACT AND COMPLETED THE IMAGE OF THEIR OWN DEFECTIONS OR THEIR OWN DELIRIUMS; ABOVE ALL HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SUCCUMBED ON THE THRESHOLD OF SONG AND A LIVING ANTHEM THIS SIDE OF INSPIRATION TO HAVE KNOWN THE REGRET OF NOT BEING A POET OF NOT BEING INITIATED INTO THE “SCIENCE OF TEARS” THE SCOURGES OF THE HEART THE FORMAL ORGIES THE IMMORTALITIES OF THE MOMENT. . . .

MANY TIMES I HAVE DREAMED OF A MELANCHOLY AND ERUDITE MONSTER VERSED IN ALL IDIOMS FAMILIAR WITH NUMBERS AND SOULS ALIKE WHO WOULD WANDER THE WORLD FEEDING ON POISONS FERVORS ECSTASIES CROSSING PERSIAS CHINAS DEFUNCT INDIES AND DYING EUROPES—MANY TIMES I HAVE DREAMED OF A FRIEND OF THE POETS WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM ALL OUT OF HIS DESPAIR AT NOT BEING ONE OF THEM.

TRIBULATIONS OF AN ALIEN
OFFSPRING OF SOME WRETCHED TRIBE HE PROWLS THE BOULEVARDS OF THE WEST. CHERISHING ONE COUNTRY AFTER THE NEXT HE NO LONGER HOPES FOR ANY; STUCK IN A TIMELESS TWILIGHT CITIZEN OF THE WORLD—AND OF NO WORLD—HE IS INEFFECTUAL NAMELESS POWERLESS. . . . PEOPLES WITHOUT A DESTINY CANNOT GIVE ONE TO THEIR SONS WHO THIRSTING FOR OTHER HORIZONS ATTACH THEMSELVES TO A FATE AND ULTIMATELY EXHAUST IT TO FINISH THEIR DAYS AS GHOSTS OF THEIR ADMIRATIONS AND THEIR EXHAUSTIONS. HAVING NOTHING TO LOVE AT HOME THEY LOCATE THEIR LOVE ELSEWHERE IN OTHER LANDS WHERE THEIR FERVOR ASTONISHES THE NATIVES. OVERWORKED THE FEELINGS ERODE AND DISINTEGRATE ADMIRATION FIRST OF ALL. . . . AND THE ALIEN WHO DISPERSED HIMSELF ON SO MANY HIGHWAYS OF THE WORLD EXCLAIMS: “I HAVE SET UP COUNTLESS IDOLS FOR MYSELF HAVE RAISED TOO MANY ALTARS EVERYWHERE AND I HAVE KNELT BEFORE A HOST OF GODS. NOW WEARY OF WORSHIP I HAVE SQUANDERED MY SHARE OF DELIRIUM. ONE HAS RESOURCES ONLY FOR THE ABSOLUTES OF ONE’S BREED; A SOUL—LIKE A COUNTRY—FLOURISHES ONLY WITHIN ITS FRONTIERS. I AM PAYING FOR HAVING CROSSED THEM FOR HAVING MADE THE INDEFINITE INTO A FATHERLAND AND FOREIGN DIVINITIES INTO A CULT FOR HAVING PROSTRATED MYSELF BEFORE AGES WHICH EXCLUDED MY ANCESTORS. WHERE I COME FROM I CAN NO LONGER SAY: IN THE TEMPLES I AM WITHOUT BELIEF; IN THE CITIES WITHOUT ARDOR; AMONG MY KIND WITHOUT CURIOSITY; ON THE EARTH WITHOUT CERTITUDES. GIVE ME A SPECIFIC DESIRE AND I COULD SHAKE THE WORLD TO ITS FOUNDATIONS. RELEASE ME FROM THIS SHAME OF ACTIONS WHICH MAKES ME PERFORM EVERY MORNING THE FARCE OF RESURRECTION AND EVERY NIGHT THAT OF ENTOMBMENT; IN THE INTERVAL NOTHING BUT THIS TORMENT IN THE SHROUD OF ENNUI. .. . I DREAM OF WANTING—AND ALL I WANT SEEMS TO ME WORTHLESS. LIKE A VANDAL CORRODED BY MELANCHOLY I PROCEED WITHOUT A GOAL SELF WITHOUT A SELF TOWARD SOME UNKNOWN CORNER . . . IN ORDER TO DISCOVER AN ABANDONED GOD A GOD WHO IS HIS OWN ATHEIST AND TO FALL ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW OF HIS LAST DOUBTS AND HIS LAST MIRACLES.”

ENNUI OF CONQUERORS
PARIS WEIGHED ON NAPOLEON BY HIS OWN ADMISSION LIKE A “LEADEN GARMENT": FOR WHICH TEN MILLION MEN WERE TO DIE. THIS IS THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE MAL DU SIÈDE WHEN A RENÉ ON HORSEBACK BECOMES ITS AGENT. BORN OF THE IDLENESS OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SALONS THIS DISEASE IN THE INDOLENCE OF AN OVER-LUCID ARISTOCRACY EXTENDED ITS RAVAGES DEEP INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE: PEASANTS WERE TO PAY WITH THEIR BLOOD FOR A MODE OF SENSIBILITY ALIEN TO THEIR NATURE AND WITH THEM A WHOLE CONTINENT. THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURES IN WHICH ENNUI INSINUATED ITSELF HORRIFIED BY ANY ONE PLACE AND OBSESSED BY A PERPETUAL ELSEWHERE EXPLOITED THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE NATIONS ONLY TO MULTIPLY THEIR GRAVEYARDS. THIS CONDOTTIÈRE WHO WEPT OVER WERTHER AND OSSIAN THIS OBERMANN WHO PROJECTED HIS VOID INTO SPACE AND WHO ACCORDING TO JOSEPHINE WAS CAPABLE OF NO MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS OF ABANDON HAD AS HIS UNAVOWED MISSION TO DEPOPULATE THE EARTH. THE DREAMING CONQUEROR IS THE GREATEST CALAMITY FOR MEN; THEY ARE NO LESS EAGER TO IDOLIZE HIM FASCINATED AS THEY ARE BY DISTORTED PROJECTS RUINOUS IDEALS UNHEALTHY AMBITIONS. NO REASONABLE BEING WAS EVER THE OBJECT OF WORSHIP LEFT A NAME OR MARKED A SINGLE EVENT WITH HIS INDIVIDUAL STAMP. IMPERTURBABLE BEFORE A PRECISE CONCEPTION OR A TRANSPARENT IDOL THE MOB IS ROUSED BY THE UNVERIFIABLE BY FALSE MYSTERIES. WHO EVER DIED IN THE NAME OF RIGOR? EACH GENERATION RAISES MONUMENTS TO THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE ONE WHICH PRECEDED IT. IT IS NONETHELESS TRUE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE WILLING ENOUGH TO BE IMMOLATED ONCE THEY BELIEVED IN GLORY IN THAT VICTORY OF ONE MAN ALONE THAT DEFEAT OF ALL. . . .

HUMANITY ADORES ONLY THOSE WHO CAUSE IT TO PERISH. REIGNS IN WHICH CITIZENS DIED IN THEIR SLEEP DO NOT FIGURE IN HISTORY NOR THE WISE PRINCE INVETERATELY SCORNED BY HIS SUBJECTS; THE CROWD LOVES THE FICTIVE EVEN AT ITS EXPENSE THE SCANDAL OF BEHAVIOR CONSTITUTING THE WEB OF HUMAN CURIOSITY AND THE UNDERGROUND CURRENT OF EVERY EVENT. THE UNFAITHFUL WOMAN AND THE CUCKOLD PROVIDE COMEDY AND TRAGEDY EVEN THE EPIC THE QUASI-TOTALITY OF THEIR MOTIFS. SINCE VIRTUE HAS NEITHER BIOGRAPHY NOR CHARM FROM THE ILIAD TO VAUDEVILLE ONLY THE LUSTER OF DISHONOR HAS ENTERTAINED AND INTRIGUED. HENCE IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT HUMANITY SHOULD HAVE OFFERED ITSELF UP TO THE CONQUERORS THAT IT SHOULD SEEK TO BE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT THAT A NATION WITHOUT TYRANTS SHOULD NEVER BE TALKED ABOUT THAT THE SUM OF INIQUITIES A PEOPLE COMMITS SHOULD BE THE SOLE INDEX OF ITS PRESENCE AND OF ITS VITALITY. A NATION WHICH NO LONGER RAPES IS IN ITS DECADENCE; THE NUMBER OF RAPES REVEALS ITS INSTINCTS AND ITS FUTURE. FIND OUT IN WHICH WAR IT HAS STOPPED PRACTICING ON A LARGE SCALE THIS VARIETY OF CRIME: YOU WILL HAVE FOUND THE FIRST SYMBOL OF ITS DECLINE; FIND OUT AT WHAT MOMENT LOVE HAS BECOME FOR A NATION A CEREMONIAL AND THE BED A CONDITION OF ORGASM AND YOU WILL IDENTIFY THE BEGINNING OF ITS DEFICIENCIES AND THE END OF ITS BARBARIC INHERITANCE.

UNIVERSAL HISTORY: HISTORY OF EVIL. TAKE AWAY THE DISASTERS FROM HUMAN EVOLUTION AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONCEIVE OF NATURE WITHOUT SEASONS. IF YOU HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED TO A CATASTROPHE YOU WILL VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE. WE INTEREST OTHERS BY THE MISFORTUNE WE SPREAD AROUND US. “I NEVER MADE ANYONE SUFFER!"—AN EXCLAMATION FOREVER ALIEN TO A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD. WHEN WE FEEL ENTHUSIASM FOR A CHARACTER OF THE PAST OR THE PRESENT WE UNCONSCIOUSLY ASK OURSELVES: “FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE WAS HE THE CAUSE OF DISASTER?” WHO KNOWS IF EACH OF US DOESN’T ASPIRE TO THE PRIVILEGE OF KILLING ALL HIS KIND? BUT THIS PRIVILEGE IS ASSIGNED TO VERY FEW AND NEVER INTEGRALLY: THIS RESTRICTION ALONE EXPLAINS WHY THE EARTH IS STILL INHABITED. INDIRECT MURDERERS WE CONSTITUTE AN INERT MASS A MULTITUDE OF OBJECTS CONFRONTING TIME’S TRUE SUBJECTS THE GREAT CRIMINALS WHO CAME TO SOMETHING.

BUT WE CAN TAKE COMFORT: OUR DESCENDANTS REMOTE OR IMMEDIATE WILL AVENGE US. FOR IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE MOMENT WHEN MEN WILL CUT EACH OTHER’S THROATS OUT OF DISGUST WITH THEMSELVES WHEN ENNUI WILL GET THE BEST OF THEIR PREJUDICES AND THEIR DIFFIDENCES WHEN THEY WILL RUN OUT INTO THE STREET TO SLAKE THEIR THIRST FOR BLOOD AND WHEN THE DESTRUCTIVE DREAM PROLONGED FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS WILL BECOME THE UNIVERSAL REALITY. . . .

MUSIC AND SKEPTICISM
I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DOUBT IN ALL THE ARTS HAVE FOUND IT THERE ONLY DISGUISED FURTIVE BREAKING OUT DURING THE ENTR'ACTES OF INSPIRATION RISING FROM SLACKENED IMPULSE; BUT I HAVE GIVEN UP SEARCHING FOR IT—EVEN IN THIS FORM—IN MUSIC; IT CANNOT BLOOM THERE: IGNORANT OF IRONY MUSIC PROCEEDS NOT FROM THE PRANKS OF THE INTELLECT BUT FROM THE TENDER OR VEHEMENT NUANCES OF NAÏVETE STUPIDITY OF THE SUBLIME HEEDLESSNESS OF THE INFINITE. . . . WIT HAVING NO EQUIVALENT IN SOUND WE DENIGRATE A MUSICIAN BY CALLING HIM INTELLIGENT. THIS ATTRIBUTE DIMINISHES HIM AND IS NOT SUITABLE IN THAT LANGUOROUS COSMOGONY WHERE LIKE A BLIND GOD HE IMPROVISES ONE UNIVERSE AFTER ANOTHER. IF HE WERE CONSCIOUS OF HIS GIFT OF HIS GENIUS HE WOULD SUCCUMB TO PRIDE; BUT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT; BORN IN THE ORACLE HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HIMSELF. LET THE STERILE INTERPRET HIM: HE IS NOT A CRITIC AS GOD IS NOT A THEOLOGIAN.

LIMIT-CASE OF UNREALITY AND THE ABSOLUTE INFINITELY REAL FICTION A LIE MORE AUTHENTIC THAN THE WORLD MUSIC LOSES ITS PRESTIGE AS SOON AS DRY OR MOROSE WE DISSOCIATE OURSELVES FROM THE CREATION AND BACH HIMSELF SEEMS NO MORE THAN INSIPID RUMORS; THIS IS THE EXTREME POINT OF OUR NON-PARTICIPATION IN THINGS OF OUR COLDNESS AND OUR COLLAPSE. TO JEER AMID THE SUBLIME—SARDONIC VICTORY OF THE SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLE AND ONE WHICH MAKES US MEMBERS OF THE DEVIL’S BROOD! LOST IS THE MAN WHO HAS NO MORE TEARS FOR MUSIC WHO EVES NOW ONLY BY THE MEMORY OF THOSE HE HAS SHED: STERILE LUCIDITY WILL HAVE VANQUISHED ECSTASY—WHICH ONCE CREATED WORLDS. . . .

THE AUTOMATON
I BREATHE OUT OF PREJUDICE. AND I CONTEMPLATE THE SPASM OF IDEAS WHILE THE VOID SMILES AT ITSELF. . . . NO MORE SWEAT IN SPACE NO MORE LIFE; THE LEAST VULGARITY WILL MAKE IT REAPPEAR: A SECOND’S WAITING WILL SUFFICE.

WHEN WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES EXISTING WE HAVE THE SENSATION OF A STUPEFIED MADMAN WHO SURPRISES HIS OWN LUNACY AND VAINLY SEEKS TO GIVE IT A NAME. HABITUACIÓN BLUNTS OUR AMAZEMENT AT BEING: WE ARE—AND MOVE ON WE GO BACK TO OUR PLACE IN THE ASYLUM OF THE EXISTING.

A CONFORMIST I LIVE I TRY TO LIVE BY IMITATION BY RESPECT FOR THE RULES OF THE GAME BY HORROR OF ORIGINALITY. AN AUTOMATON’S RESIGNATION: TO AFFECT A PRETENSE OF FERVOR AND SECRETLY TO LAUGH AT IT; TO BOW TO CONVENTIONS ONLY TO REPUDIATE THEM ON THE SLY; TO BE NUMBERED IN EVERY LEDGER BUT TO HAVE NO RESIDENCE IN TIME; TO SAVE FACE WHEREAS IT WOULD BE ONLY DUTY TO LOSE IT. . . .

THE MAN WHO SCORNS EVERYTHING MUST ASSUME AN AIR OF PERFECT DIGNITY DECEIVE THE OTHERS AND EVEN HIMSELF: THEREBY HE WILL THE MORE EASILY ACCOMPLISH HIS TASK OF COUNTERFEIT LIVING. WHAT USE DISPLAYING YOUR FAILURE WHEN YOU CAN FEIGN PROSPERITY? HELL LACKS MANNERS: IT IS THE EXASPERATED IMAGE OF A FRANK AND UNCOUTH MAN IT IS THE EARTH CONCEIVED WITHOUT ONE SUPERSTITION OF ELEGANCE AND CIVILITY.

I ACCEPT LIFE OUT OF POLITENESS: PERPETUAL REBELLION IS IN BAD TASTE AS IS THE SUBLIMITY OF SUICIDE. AT TWENTY WE RAGE AGAINST THE HEAVENS AND THE FILTH THEY HIDE; THEN WE GROW TIRED OF IT. THE TRAGIC ATTITUDE SUITS ONLY AN EXTENDED AND RIDICULOUS PUBERTY; BUT IT TAKES A THOUSAND ORDEALS TO ACHIEVE THE HISTRIONICS OF DETACHMENT.

THE MAN WHO LIBERATED FROM ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF CUSTOM LACKS ANY GIFT AS AN ACTOR IS THE ARCHETYPE OF WRETCHEDNESS THE IDEALLY UNHAPPY BEING. NO USE CONSTRUCTING THIS MODEL OF INGENUOUSNESS: LIFE IS TOLERABLE ONLY BY THE DEGREE OF MYSTIFICATION WE ENDOW IT WITH. SUCH A MODEL WOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE RAIN OF SOCIETY THE “PLEASURE” OF COMMUNAL LIFE RESIDING IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GIVING FREE REIN TO THE INFINITY OF OUR ULTERIOR MOTIVES. IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IMPOSTORS THAT WE ENDURE EACH OTHER. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT CONSENT TO LIE WILL SEE THE EARTH SHRINK UNDER HIS FEET: WE ARE BIOLOGICALLY OBLIGED TO THE FALSE. NO MORAL HERO WHO IS NOT CHILDISH INEFFECTUAL OR INAUTHENTIC; FOR TRUE AUTHENTICITY IS THE FLAW IN FRAUD IN THE PROPRIETIES OF PUBLIC FLATTERY AND SECRET DEFAMATION. IF OUR FELLOW MEN COULD BE AWARE OF OUR OPINIONS ABOUT THEM LOVE FRIENDSHIP AND DEVOTION WOULD BE FOREVER ERASED FROM THE DICTIONARIES; AND IF WE HAD THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT THE DOUBTS WE TIMIDLY CONCEIVE ABOUT OURSELVES NONE OF US WOULD UTTER AN “I” WITHOUT SHAME. MASQUERADE RULES ALL THE LIVING FROM THE TROGLODYTE TO THE SKEPTIC. SINCE ONLY THE RESPECT FOR APPEARANCES SEPARATES US FROM CARRION IT IS DEATH TO CONSIDER THE BASIS OF THINGS OF BEINGS; LET US ABIDE BY A MORE AGREEABLE NOTHINGNESS: OUR CONSTITUTION TOLERATES ONLY A CERTAIN DOSAGE OF TRUTH. . . .

LET US KEEP DEEP DOWN INSIDE A CERTITUDE SUPERIOR TO ALL THE OTHERS: LIFE HAS NO MEANING IT CANNOT HAVE ANY SUCH THING. WE SHOULD KILL OURSELVES ON THE SPOT IF AN UNLOOKED FOR REVELATION PERSUADED US OF THE CONTRARY. THE AIR GONE WE SHOULD STILL BREATHE; BUT WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SMOTHER IF THE JOY OF INANITY WERE TAKEN FROM US. . . .

ON MELANCHOLY
WHEN WE CANNOT BE DELIVERED FROM OURSELVES WE DELIGHT IN DEVOURING OURSELVES. IN VAIN WE CALL UPON THE LORD OF SHADES THE BESTOWER OF A PRECISE CURSE: WE ARE INVALIDS WITHOUT DISEASE AND REPROBATES WITHOUT VICES. MELANCHOLY IS THE DREAM STATE OF EGOISM: NO LONGER ANY OBJECT OUTSIDE ONESELF NO REASON FOR HATE OR LOVE BUT THAT SAME FALL INTO A LANGUID MUD THAT SAME CIRCLING OF THE DAMNED WITHOUT A HELL THOSE SAME REITERATIONS OF A ZEAL TO PERISH. . . . WHEREAS SADNESS IS CONTENT WITH A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CONTEXT MELANCHOLY REQUIRES A DEBAUCH OF SPACE AN INFINITE LANDSCAPE IN ORDER TO SPREAD OUT ITS SULLEN AND VAPOROUS GRACE ITS SHAPELESS EVIL WHICH FEARING TO RECOVER DREADS ANY LIMIT TO ITS DISSOLUTION AND ITS UNDULATION. IT EXPANDS—STRANGEST FLOWER OF SELF-LOVE—AMONG THE POISONS FROM WHICH IT EXTRACTS ITS VITAL JUICES AND THE VIGOR OF ALL ITS FAILURES. FEEDING ON WHAT CORRUPTS IT MELANCHOLY HIDES UNDER ITS MELODIOUS NAME SELF-COMMISERATION AND THE PRIDE OF DEFEAT. .

THE THIRST FOR POWER
A CAESAR IS CLOSER TO A VILLAGE MAYOR THAN TO A MIND SOVEREIGNLY LUCID BUT LACKING THE INSTINCT OF DOMINATION. THE IMPORTANT FACT IS TO COMMAND: ALMOST ALL MEN ASPIRE TO THIS. WHETHER YOU HAVE IN YOUR HANDS AN EMPIRE A TRIBE A FAMILY OR A SERVANT YOU DEPLOY YOUR TALENT AS A TYRANT GLORIOUS OR ABSURD: A WHOLE WORLD OR A SINGLE PERSON OBEYS YOUR ORDERS. THUS IS ESTABLISHED THE SERIES OF CALAMITIES WHICH RISE FROM THE NEED THE THIRST TO EXCEL . . . WE JOSTLE NONE BUT SATRAPS: EACH OF US—ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS—SEEKS OUT A HOST OF SLAVES OR IS CONTENT WITH JUST ONE. NO ONE IS SELF-SUFFICIENT: THE MOST MODEST OF MEN WILL ALWAYS FIND A FRIEND OR A COMPANION TO AUTHENTICATE HIS DREAM OF AUTHORITY. THE MAN WHO OBEYS WILL BE OBEYED IN HIS TURN: THE VICTIM WILL BECOME THE EXECUTIONER; THIS IS THE SUPREME DESIRE—UNIVERSALLY. ONLY BEGGARS AND SAGES DO NOT EXPERIENCE IT; UNLESS THEIRS IS AN EVEN SUBTLER GAME. . .

THE THIRST FOR POWER PERMITS HISTORY TO RENEW ITSELF AND YET TO REMAIN BASICALLY THE SAME; RELIGIONS TRY TO OPPOSE THIS APPETITE BUT MANAGE ONLY TO EXASPERATE IT. CHRISTIANITY WOULD HAVE FOUND AN ISSUE WHETHER THE EARTH WAS A DESERT OR A PARADISE. UNDER THE VARIABLE FORMS MAN CAN ASSUME IS CONCEALED ONE CONSTANT AN IDENTICAL BASIS WHICH EXPLAINS WHY AGAINST ALL THE APPEARANCES OF CHANGE WE MOVE IN A CIRCLE—AND WHY IF WE LOST FOLLOWING SOME SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION OUR QUALITY AS MONSTERS AND CLOWNS HISTORY WOULD IMMEDIATELY VANISH.

TRY TO BE FREE: YOU WILL DIE OF HUNGER. SOCIETY TOLERATES YOU ONLY IF YOU ARE SUCCESSIVELY SERVILE AND DESPOTIC; IT IS A PRISON WITHOUT GUARDS—BUT FROM WHICH YOU DO NOT ESCAPE WITHOUT DYING. WHERE TO GO WHEN YOU CAN LIVE ONLY IN THE CITY AND YOU LACK THE INSTINCTS FOR DOING SO AND WHEN YOU ARE NOT ENTERPRISING ENOUGH TO BEG YOUR BREAD NOR BALANCED ENOUGH TO GIVE YOURSELF UP TO WISDOM? IN THE END YOU STAY THERE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE PRETENDING TO BUSY YOURSELF; YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF OF THIS EXTREMITY BY THE RESOURCES OF ARTIFICE SINCE IT IS LESS ABSURD TO SIMULATE LIFE THAN TO LIVE IT.

AS LONG AS MEN HAVE THE PASSION OF THE CITY A DISGUISED CANNIBALISM WILL RULE THERE. THE POLITICAL INSTINCT IS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF SIN THE IMMEDIATE MATERIALIZATION OF THE FALL. EACH MAN SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO HIS SOLITUDE BUT EACH MAN KEEPS AN EYE ON THAT OF EVERYONE ELSE. ANGELS AND BANDITS HAVE THEIR LEADERS; HOW COULD THE INTERMEDIARY CREATURES—THE VERY TEXTURE OF HUMANITY—LACK THEIRS? TAKE AWAY THEIR DESIRE TO BE SLAVES OR TYRANTS AND YOU DEMOLISH THE CITY IN THE WINK OF AN EYE. THE MONKEY-PACT IS SEALED FOREVER; AND HISTORY FOLLOWS ITS COURSE THE HORDE GASPING BETWEEN CRIMES AND DREAMS. NOTHING CAN ARREST IT: EVEN THOSE WHO EXECRATE IT PARTICIPATE IN ITS PROGRESS. . . .

POSITION OF THE POOR
OWNERS AND BEGGARS: TWO CATEGORIES WHICH OPPOSE ANY CHANGE ANY RENEWING DISORDER. PLACED AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE SOCIAL LADDER THEY FEAR ANY MODIFICATION IN GOOD AND EVIL: THEY ARE EQUALLY SETTLED THE FORMER IN OPULENCE THE LATTER IN DESTITUTION. BETWEEN DIEM ARE LOCATED—ANONYMOUS SWEAT THE BASIS OF SOCIETY—THOSE WHO STRIVE LABOR PERSEVERE AND CULTIVATE THE ABSURDITY OF HOPE. THE STATE FEEDS ON THEIR ANEMIA; THE NOTION OF CITIZEN WOULD HAVE NEITHER CONTENT NOR REALITY WITHOUT THEM ANY MORE THAN LUXURY AND ALMS: THE RICH MAN AND THE BEGGAR ARE PARASITES OF THE POOR THE PAUPER’S DEPENDENTS.

IF MISERY HAS A THOUSAND REMEDIES POVERTY HAS NONE. HOW SUCCOR THOSE WHO PERSIST IN NOT DYING OF HUNGER? GOD HIMSELF COULD NOT CORRECT THEIR LOT. BETWEEN FORTUNE’S DARLINGS AND THE TATTERDEMALION CIRCULATE THESE HONORABLE STARVELINGS EXPLOITED BY SPLENDOR AND BY RAGS PILLAGED BY THOSE WHO LOATHING LABOR SETTLE ACCORDING TO THEIR LUCK OR THEIR VOCATION IN THE SALON OR THE GUTTER. AND SO HUMANITY ADVANCES: WITH A FEW RICH MEN WITH A FEW BEGGARS—AND WITH ALL ITS POOR. . . .

FACES OF DECADENCE
THE WEARINESS OF LONG-FORGOTTEN PEOPLES HANGS HEAVY ON MY EYELIDS.

—HUGO VON HOFMANNSTHAL

A CIVILIZATION BEGINS TO DECLINE THE MOMENT LIFE BECOMES ITS SOLE OBSESSION. EPOCHS OF APOGEE CULTIVATE VALUES FOR THEIR OWN SAKE: LIFE IS ONLY A MEANS OF REALIZING THEM; THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT AWARE OF LIVING HE LIVES—HAPPY SLAVE OF THE FORMS HE ENGENDERS TENDS AND IDOLIZES. AFFECTIVITY DOMINATES AND FILLS HIM. NO CREATION WITHOUT THE RESOURCES OF “FEELING” WHICH ARE LIMITED; YET FOR THE MAN WHO EXPERIENCES ONLY THEIR WEALTH THEY SEEM INEXHAUSTIBLE: THIS ILLUSION PRODUCES HISTORY. IN DECADENCE AFFECTIVE DRYING-UP PERMITS ONLY TWO MODALITIES OF FEELING AND UNDERSTANDING: SENSATION AND IDEA. NOW IT IS BY AFFECTIVITY THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD OF VALUES THAT WE PROJECT A VITALITY INTO CATEGORIES AND NORMS. THE ACTIVITY OF A PRODUCTIVE CIVILIZATION CONSISTS IN DRAWING IDEAS OUT OF THEIR ABSTRACT NOTHINGNESS IN TRANSFORMING CONCEPTS INTO MYTHS. THE TRANSITION FROM THE ANONYMOUS INDIVIDUAL TO THE CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE; YET IT IS INEVITABLE. MEASURE IT: IN GREECE FROM HOMER TO THE SOPHISTS; IN ROME FROM THE AUSTERE OLD REPUBLIC TO THE “WISDOMS” OF THE EMPIRE; IN THE MODERN WORLD FROM THE CATHEDRALS TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LACE.

A NATION CANNOT CREATE INDEFINITELY. IT IS OILED UPON TO GIVE EXPRESSION AND MEANING TO A SUM OF VALUES WHICH ARE EXHAUSTED WITH THE SOUL WHICH HAS BEGOTTEN THEM. THE CITIZEN WAKENS FROM A PRODUCTIVE HYPNOSIS; THE REIGN OF LUCIDITY BEGINS; THE MASSES WIELD NO MORE THAN EMPTY CATEGORIES. MYTHS TURN BACK INTO CONCEPTS: THAT IS DECADENCE. AND THE CONSEQUENCES MAKE THEMSELVES FELT: THE INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO LIVE HE CONVERTS LIFE INTO FINALITY HE ELEVATES HIMSELF TO THE RANK OF A MINOR EXCEPTION. THE LEDGER OF THESE EXCEPTIONS CONSTITUTING THE DEFICIT OF A CIVILIZATION PREFIGURES ITS EFFACEMENT.

EVERYONE ACHIEVES DELICACY—BUT IS IT NOT THE RADIANT STUPIDITY OF THE DOLTS WHICH ACCOMPLISHES THE WORK OF THE GREAT PERIODS?

ACCORDING TO MONTESQUIEU AT THE END OF THE EMPIRE THE ROMAN ARMY CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF CAVALRY. BUT HE NEGLECTS TO SUPPLY US WITH THE REASON FOR THIS. IMAGINE THE LEGIONARY SATURATED WITH GLORY WEALTH AND DEBAUCHERY AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED COUNTLESS LANDS AND HAVING LOST HIS FAITH AND HIS FORCE ON CONTACT WITH SO MANY TEMPLES AND VICES—IMAGINE SUCH A MAN ON FOOT! HE HAS CONQUERED THE WORLD AS AN INFANTRYMAN; HE WILL LOSE IT ON HORSEBACK. INDOLENCE INVARIABLY REVEALS A PHYSIOLOGICAL INCAPACITY TO ADHERE ANY LONGER TO THE MYTHS OF THE CITY. THE EMANCIPATED SOLDIER AND THE LUCID CITIZEN SUCCUMB TO THE BARBARIAN. THE DISCOVERY OF LIFE ANNIHILATES LIFE.

WHEN AN ENTIRE NATION AT VARIOUS LEVELS IS IN SEARCH OF RARE SENSATIONS WHEN BY THE SUBTLETIES OF TASTE IT COMPLICATES ITS REFLEXES IT HAS ACCEDED TO A FATAL PITCH OF SUPERIORITY. DECADENCE IS MERELY INSTINCT GONE IMPURE UNDER THE ACTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS. HENCE WE CANNOT OVERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GASTRONOMY IN THE EXISTENCE OF A COLLECTIVITY. THE CONSCIOUS ACT OF EATING IS AN ALEXANDRIAN PHENOMENON; BARBARISM FEEDS. INTELLECTUAL AND RELIGIOUS ECLECTICISM SENSUAL INGENUITY AESTHETICISM AND THE LEARNED OBSESSION OF GOOD LIVING ARE THE VARIOUS SIGNS OF ONE AND THE SAME FORM OF MIND. WHEN GABIUS APICIUS EXPLORED THE AFRICAN COAST FOR LOBSTERS WITHOUT SETTLING ANYWHERE BECAUSE HE FOUND NONE TO HIS TASTE HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE UNEASY SOULS WHO WORSHIPPED THE HOST OF ALIEN GODS WITHOUT FINDING SATISFACTION OR REST AMONG THEM. RARE SENSATIONS —DIVERSE DEITIES PARALLEL FRUITS OF THE SAME DRYNESS OF THE SAME CURIOSITY WITHOUT INNER RESOURCES. CHRISTIANITY APPEARED: A SINGLE GOD—AND FASTING. AND AN AGE OF TRIVIALITY AND THE SUBLIME BEGAN. . . .

A NATION DIES WHEN IT NO LONGER HAS THE STRENGTH TO INVENT NEW GODS NEW MYTHS NEW ABSURDITIES; ITS IDOLS BLUR AND VANISH; IT SEEKS THEM ELSEWHERE AND FEELS ALONE BEFORE UNKNOWN MONSTERS. THIS TOO IS DECADENCE. BUT IF ONE OF THESE MONSTERS PREVAILS ANOTHER WORLD SETS ITSELF IN MOTION CRUDE DIM INTOLERANT UNTIL IT EXHAUSTS ITS GOD AND EMANCIPATES ITSELF FROM HIM; FOR MAN IS FREE—AND STERILE—ONLY IN THE INTERVAL WHEN THE GODS DIE; SLAVE—AND CREATIVE—ONLY IN THE INTERVAL WHEN AS TYRANTS THEY FLOURISH.

TO MEDITATE UPON ONE’S SENSATIONS—TO KNOW ONE IS EATING—IS AN ACCESSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY WHICH AN ELEMENTARY ACTION TRANSCENDS ITS IMMEDIATE GOAL. ALONGSIDE INTELLECTUAL DISGUST DEVELOPS ANOTHER DEEPER AND MORE DANGEROUS: EMANATING FROM THE VISCERA IT ENDS AT THE SEVEREST FORM OF NIHILISM THE NIHILISM OF REPLETION. THE BITTEREST CONSIDERATIONS CANNOT COMPARE IN THEIR EFFECTS WITH THE VISION FOLLOWING AN OPULENT BANQUET. EVERY MEAL WHICH EXCEEDS IN TIME A FEW MINUTES AND IN DISHES THE NECESSITIES DISINTEGRATES OUR CERTITUDES. CULINARY ABUSE AND SATIETY DESTROYED THE EMPIRE MORE PITILESSLY THAN THE ORIENTAL SECTS AND THE ILL-ASSIMILATED GREEK DOCTRINES. WE EXPERIENCE AN AUTHENTIC SHUDDER OF SKEPTICISM ONLY AROUND A COPIOUS TABLE. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MUST HAVE REPRESENTED A TEMPTATION AFTER SUCH EXCESSES OR A DELICIOUSLY PERVERSE SURPRISE IN THE MONOTONY OF DIGESTION. HUNGER SEEKS A WAY TO SALVATION IN RELIGION; SATIETY A POISON. TO BE “SAVED” BY VIRUSES AND IN THE INDISCRIMINATION OF PRAYERS AND VICES TO FLEE THE WORLD AND WALLOW IN IT BY THE SAME ACTION . . . THAT IS INDEED THE APEX OF ACRIMONY AND OF ALEXANDRIANISM.

THERE IS A PLENITUDE OF DECLINE IN EVERY OVERRIPE CIVILIZATION. INSTINCTS SLACKEN; PLEASURES DILATE AND NO LONGER CORRESPOND TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION; THE VOLUPTUOUS BECOMES AN END IN ITSELF ITS PROLONGATION AN ART THE AVOIDANCE OF ORGASM A TECHNIQUE SEXUALITY A SCIENCE. METHODS AND LITERARY INSPIRATIONS TO MULTIPLY THE CHANNELS OF DESIRE THE IMAGINATION TORMENTED IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY THE PRELIMINARIES OF RELEASE THE MIND ITSELF INVOLVED IN A REALM ALIEN TO ITS NATURE AND OVER WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE NO PURCHASE—ALL SO MANY SYMPTOMS OF THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE BLOOD AND THE MORBID INTELLECTUALIZATION OF THE FLESH. LOVE CONCEIVED AS A RITUAL MAKES THE INTELLIGENCE SOVEREIGN IN THE EMPIRE OF STUPIDITY. OUR AUTOMATISMS SUFFER FOR IT; SHACKLED THEY LOSE THAT IMPATIENCE TO LET LOOSE AN INADMISSIBLE CONTORTION; THE NERVES BECOME THE THEATER OF LUCID DISCOMFORTS AND SHUDDERS SENSATION IN SHORT EXTENDS BEYOND ITS CRUDE DURATION THANKS TO THE SKILL OF TWO TORTURERS OF STUDIED VOLUPTUOUSNESS. THEY ARE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO DECEIVES THE SPECIES AND THE BLOOD TOO TEPID TO STUN THE MIND THE BLOOD CHILLED AND THINNED BY IDEAS THE RATIONAL BLOOD. . . .

INSTINCTS ERODED BY CONVERSATION. . . .

*

NOTHING MONUMENTAL HAS EVER EMERGED FROM DIALOGUE NOTHING EXPLOSIVE NOTHING “GREAT.” IF HUMANITY HAD NOT INDULGED IN DISCUSSING ITS OWN STRENGTH IT WOULD NEVER HAVE EXCEEDED HOMER’S VISION AND HIS MODELS. BUT DIALECTICS RAVAGING THE SPONTANEITY OF REFLEXES AND THE SPIRIT OF MYTHS HAS REDUCED THE HERO TO A TOTTERING EXAMPLE. TODAY’S ACHILLES HAS MORE THAN A HEEL TO WORRY ABOUT. . . . VULNERABILITY ONCE PARTIAL AND OF NO CONSEQUENCE HAS BECOME THE ACCURSED PRIVILEGE THE ESSENCE OF EACH BEING. CONSCIOUSNESS HAS MADE ITS WAY EVERYWHERE RESIDING IN THE VERY MARROW OF OUR BONES; HENCE MAN NO LONGER LIVES IN EXISTENCE BUT IN THE THEORY OF EXISTENCE. . . .

THE CLEAR-SIGHTED PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS HIMSELF EXPLAINS HIMSELF JUSTIFIES HIMSELF AND DOMINATES HIS ACTIONS WILL NEVER MAKE A MEMORABLE GESTURE. PSYCHOLOGY IS THE HERO’S GRAVE. THE MILLENNIA OF RELIGION AND REASONING HAVE WEAKENED MUSCLES DECISIONS AND THE IMPULSE OF RISK. HOW KEEP FROM SCORNING THE ENTERPRISES OF GLORY? EVERY ACT OVER WHICH THE MIND’S LUMINOUS MALEDICTION FAILS TO PRESIDE REPRESENTS A VESTIGE OF ANCESTRAL STUPIDITY. IDEOLOGIES WERE INVENTED ONLY TO GIVE A LUSTER TO THE LEFTOVER BARBARISM WHICH HAS SURVIVED DOWN THROUGH THE AGES TO COVER UP THE MURDEROUS TENDENCIES COMMON TO ALL MEN. TODAY WE KILL IN THE NAME OF SOMETHING; WE NO LONGER DARE DO SO SPONTANEOUSLY; SO THAT THE VERY EXECUTIONERS MUST INVOKE MOTIVES AND HEROISM BEING OBSOLETE THE MAN WHO IS TEMPTED BY IT SOLVES A PROBLEM MORE THAN HE PERFORMS A SACRIFICE. ABSTRACTION HAS INSINUATED ITSELF INTO LIFE—AND INTO DEATH; THE “COMPLEXES” SEIZE GREAT AND SMALL ALIKE. FROM THE ILIAD TO PSYCHOPATHOBGY—THERE YOU HAVE ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY.

IN CIVILIZATIONS ON THE WANE TWILIGHT IS THE SIGN OF A NOBLE PUNISHMENT. WHAT ECSTASY OF IRONY THEY MUST EXPERIENCE UPON SEEING THEMSELVES EXCLUDED FROM BECOMING AFTER HAVING ESTABLISHED FOR CENTURIES THE NORMS OF POWER AND THE CRITERIA OF TASTE! WITH EACH OF THEM A WHOLE WORLD GOES OUT. SENSATIONS OF THE LAST GREEK THE LAST ROMAN! WHO CAN KEEP FROM FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE GREAT SUNSETS? THE CHARM OF AGONY SURROUNDING A CIVILIZATION AFTER IT HAS CONFRONTED EVERY PROBLEM AND MARVELOUSLY WARPED THEM OFFERS MORE SEDUCTIONS THAN THE INVIOLATE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THAT CIVILIZATION BEGAN.

EACH CIVILIZATION REPRESENTS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS THE UNIVERSE PROPOSES; BUT THE MYSTERY REMAINS INTACT; NEW CIVILIZATIONS WITH NEW CURIOSITIES WILL COME TO TRY THEIR LUCK QUITE AS VAINLY EACH OF THEM BEING MERELY A SYSTEM OF MISTAKES. . . .

AT THE APOGEE WE BEGET VALUES; AT TWILIGHT WORN AND DEFEATED WE ABOLISH THEM. FASCINATION OF DECADENCE—OF THE AGES WHEN THE TRUTHS HAVE NO FURTHER LIFE . . . WHEN THEY PILE UP LIKE SKELETONS IN THE DESICCATED PENSIVE SOUL IN THE BONEYARD OF DREAMS. . . .

HOW DEAR TO ME THAT ALEXANDRIAN PHILOSOPHER NAMED OLIMPIUS WHO HEARING A VOICE SINGING THE HALLELUJAH IN THE SERAPION WENT INTO EXILE FOREVER! THIS WAS TOWARD THE END OF THE FOURTH CENTURY; ALREADY THE LUGUBRIOUS STUPIDITY OF THE CROSS WAS CASTING ITS SHADOWS ACROSS THE MIND.

AROUND THE SAME PERIOD PALLADAS THE GRAMMARIAN COULD WRITE: “WE GREEKS ARE NO MORE THAN ASHES TODAY. OUR HOPES ARE BURIED LIKE THOSE OF THE DEAD.” AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL INTELLECTS OF THAT TIME.

VAINLY A CELSUS A PORPHYRY A JULIAN THE APOSTATE STRIVES TO HALT THE INVASION OF THAT NEBULOUS SUBLIME WHICH OVERFLOWS THE CATACOMBS: THE APOSTLES HAVE LEFT THEIR STIGMATA IN MEN’S SOULS AND MULTIPLIED THEIR RAVAGES IN THE CITIES. THE AGE OF THE GREAT UGLINESS BEGINS; HYSTERIA WITHOUT QUALITY SPREADS OVER THE WORLD. SAINT PAUL—THE MOST CONSIDERABLE VOTE-CANVASSER OF ALL TIME—HAS MADE HIS TOURS INFESTING THE CLARITY OF THE ANCIENT TWILIGHT WITH HIS EPISTLES. AN EPILEPTIC TRIUMPHS OVER FIVE CENTURIES OF PHILOSOPHY! REASON IS CONFISCATED BY THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH!

AND IF I WERE TO LOOK FOR THE MOST MORTIFYING DATE FOR THE MIND’S PRIDE IF I WERE TO SCAN THE INVENTORY OF INTOLERANCES I WOULD FIND NOTHING COMPARABLE TO THE YEAR 529 WHEN FOLLOWING JUSTINIAN’S DECREE THE SCHOOL OF ATHENS WAS CLOSED. THE RIGHT TO DECADENCE BEING OFFICIALLY SUPPRESSED TO BELIEVE BECAME AN OBLIGATION. . . . THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF DOUBT.

WHEN A NATION NO LONGER HAS ANY PREJUDICE IN ITS BLOOD ITS SOLE RESOURCE REMAINS ITS WILL TO DISINTEGRATE. IMITATING MUSIC THAT DISCIPLINE OF DISSOLUTION IT MAKES ITS FAREWELLS TO THE PASSIONS TO LYRIC WASTE TO SENTIMENTALITY TO BLINDNESS. HENCEFORTH IT CAN NO LONGER WORSHIP WITHOUT IRONY: THE SENSE OF DISTANCES WILL BE ITS LOT FOREVER.

PREJUDICE IS AN ORGANIC TRUTH FALSE IN ITSELF BUT ACCUMULATED BY GENERATIONS AND TRANSMITTED: WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES OF IT WITH IMPUNITY. THE NATION THAT RENOUNCES IT HEEDLESSLY WILL THEN RENOUNCE ITSELF UNTIL IT HAS NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE UP. THE DURATION OF A COLLECTIVITY AND ITS CONSISTENCY COINCIDE WITH THE DURATION AND CONSISTENCY OF ITS PREJUDICES. THE ORIENTAL NATIONS OWE THEIR EVERLASTINGNESS TO THEIR LOYALTY TO THEMSELVES: HAVING FAILED TO “DEVELOP” THEY HAVE NOT BETRAYED THEMSELVES; AND THEY HAVE NOT LIVED IN THE SENSE IN WHICH LIFE IS CONCEIVED BY CIVILIZATIONS ON THE RUN THE ONLY ONES HISTORY IS CONCERNED WITH; FOR HISTORY DISCIPLINE OF DAWNS AND OF GASPING DEATHBEDS—HISTORY IS A NOVEL LAYING CLAIM TO RIGOR AND WHICH DRAWS ITS SUBSTANCE FROM THE ARCHIVES OF THE BLOOD. . . .

ALEXANDRIANISM IS A PERIOD OF SKILFUL NEGATIONS A STYLE OF IN-UTILITY AND REFUSAL A DISPLAY OF ERUDITION AND SARCASM ABOVE THE CONFUSION OF VALUES AND BELIEFS. ITS IDEAL SPACE WOULD BE AT THE INTERSECTION OF HELLAS AND BYGONE PARIS THE MEETING PLACE OF THE AGORA AND THE SALON. A CIVILIZATION EVOLVES FROM AGRICULTURE TO PARADOX. BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES UNFOLDS THE COMBAT OF BARBARISM AND NEUROSIS; FROM IT RESULTS THE UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM OF CREATIVE EPOCHS. THIS COMBAT IS APPROACHING ITS CLOSE: ALL HORIZONS ARE OPENING WITHOUT ANY BEING ABLE TO EXCITE AN EXHAUSTED AND DISABUSED CURIOSITY. IT IS THEN UP TO THE ENLIGHTENED INDIVIDUAL TO FLOURISH IN THE VOID—UP TO THE INTELLECTUAL VAMPIRE TO SLAKE HIS THIRST ON THE VITIATED BLOOD OF CIVILIZATIONS.

MUST WE TAKE HISTORY SERIOUSLY OR STAND ON THE SIDELINES AS A SPECTATOR? ARE WE TO SEE IT AS A STRUGGLE TOWARD A GOAL OR THE CELEBRATION OF A LIGHT WHICH INTENSIFIES AND FADES WITH NEITHER NECESSITY NOR REASON? THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON OUR DEGREE OF ILLUSION ABOUT MAN ON OUR CURIOSITY TO DIVINE THE WAY IN WHICH WILL BE RESOLVED THAT MIXTURE OF WALTZ AND SLAUGHTERHOUSE WHICH COMPOSES AND STIMULATES HIS BECOMING.

THERE IS A WELTSCHMERZ A MAL DU SIÈCK WHICH IS MERELY THE ILLNESS OF A GENERATION; THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH FOLLOWS UPON ALL HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND WHICH BECOMES THE UNAVOIDABLE CONCLUSION FOR THE TIME TO COME. THIS IS WHAT THE FRENCH CALL VAGUE À LÂME A MELANCHOLY YEARNING FOR THE END OF THE WORLD. EVERYTHING CHANGES ITS ASPECT EVEN THE SUN; EVERYTHING AGES EVEN DISASTER . . .

INCAPABLE OF RHETORIC WE ARE ROMANTICS OF LUCID DISAPPOINTMENT. TODAY WERTHER MANFRED RENÉ KNOW THEIR DISEASE AND DISPLAY IT WITHOUT CEREMONY. BIOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY—GROTESQUE NAMES WHICH SUPPRESSING THE NAÏVETÉ OF OUR DESPAIR AND INTRODUCING ANALYSIS INTO OUR SONGS BRING US TO SCORN ALL DECLAMATION. DISCIPLINED BY THE VARIOUS TREATISES OUR SCHOLARLY ACERBITIES EXPLAIN OUR SHAMES AND CLASSIFY OUR FRENZIES.

WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS SUCCEEDS IN SOUNDING ALL OUR SECRETS WHEN OUR MISERY HAS BEEN DRAINED OF ITS LAST VESTIGE OF MYSTERY WILL WE STILL HAVE ANY FEVER AND EXALTATION LEFT TO CONTEMPLATE THE WRECK OF EXISTENCE AND OF POETRY?

TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY THE BURDEN OF BECOMING AND THAT LOAD UNDER WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS SAGS WHEN IT CONSIDERS THE SUM AND THE INANITY OF PAST OR POSSIBLE EVENTS. .. . IN VAIN NOSTALGIA INVOKES AN IMPULSE IGNORANT OF THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ALL THAT HAS EVER BEEN; THERE IS A WEARINESS FOR WHICH THE FUTURE ITSELF IS A CEMETERY A POTENTIAL CEMETERY AS IS EVERYTHING WHICH AWAITS BEING. THE CENTURIES HAVE GROWN HEAVY AND WEIGH UPON THE MOMENT. WE ARE MORE CORRUPT THAN ALL THE AGES MORE DECOMPOSED THAN ALL THE EMPIRES. OUR EXHAUSTION INTERPRETS HISTORY OUR BREATHLESSNESS MAKES US HEAR THE DEATH RATTLE OF NATIONS. CHLOROTIC COMEDIANS WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE STAND-IN PARTS IN THE HACKNEYED STORIES THE WELL-WORN PERIODS: THE CURTAIN OF THE UNIVERSE IS MOTH-EATEN AND THROUGH ITS HOLES WE SEE NOTHING NOW BUT MASKS AND GHOSTS. . . .

THE MISTAKE OF THOSE WHO APPREHEND DECADENCE IS TO TRY TO OPPOSE IT WHEREAS IT MUST BE ENCOURAGED: BY DEVELOPING IT EXHAUSTS ITSELF AND PERMITS THE ADVENT OF OTHER FORMS. THE TRUE HARBINGER IS NOT THE MAN WHO OFFERS A SYSTEM WHEN NO ONE WANTS IT BUT RATHER THE MAN WHO PRECIPITATES CHAOS ITS AGENT AND INCENSE-BEARER. IT IS VULGAR TO TRUMPET DOGMAS IN EXTENUATED AGES WHEN ANY DREAM OF THE FUTURE SEEMS A DREAM OR AN IMPOSTURE. TO MAKE FOR THE END OF TIME WITH A FLOWER IN ONE’S BUTTONHOLE—THE SOLE COMPORTMENT WORTHY OF US IN TIME’S PASSAGE. A PITY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LAST JUDGMENT NO OCCASION FOR A GREAT DEFIANCE! BELIEVERS: HAMFATTERS OF ETERNITY; FAITH: CRAVING FOR A TIMELESS STAGE. . . . BUT WE UNBELIEVERS WE DIE WITH OUR DECORS AND TOO TIRED OUT TO DECEIVE OURSELVES WITH BLAZONRY PROMISED TO OUR CORPSES. . . .

ACCORDING TO MEISTER ECKHART DIVINITY PRECEDES GOD BEING HIS ESSENCE HIS UNFATHOMABLE DEPTH. WHAT SHOULD WE FIND AT MAN’S INMOST CORE WHICH DEFINES HIS SUBSTANCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE DIVINE ESSENCE? NEURASTHENIA—WHICH IS TO MAN WHAT DIVINITY IS TO GOD.

WE LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF EXHAUSTION: THE ACT OF CREATION OF MAKING AND PRODUCING IS LESS SIGNIFICANT IN AND OF ITSELF THAN IN RELATION TO THE VOID TO THE FALL WHICH FOLLOWS. . . . FOR OUR INVARIABLY COMPROMISED EFFORTS THE DIVINE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE DEPTHS ARE SITUATED OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF OUR CONCEPTS AND OUR SENSATIONS. MAN WAS BORN WITH THE VOCATION OF FATIGUE: WHEN HE ADOPTED THE VERTICAL POSTURE AND THEREBY DIMINISHED HIS POSSIBILITIES OF SUPPORT HE WAS DOOMED TO WEAKNESSES UNKNOWN TO THE ANIMAL HE WAS. TO CARRY ON TWO LEGS SO MUCH SUBSTANCE AND ALL THE DISGUSTS RELATED TO IT! THE GENERATIONS ACCUMULATE WEARINESS AND TRANSMIT IT; OUR FATHERS BEQUEATH TO US A PATRIMONY OF ANEMIA RESERVES OF DISCOURAGEMENT RESOURCES OF DECOMPOSITION AND AN ENERGY IN DYING WHICH BECOMES MORE POWERFUL THAN OUR INSTINCTS TO LIVE. AND IT IS IN THIS FASHION THAT THE HABITUDE OF DISAPPEARING PROPPED ON OUR CAPITAL OF FATIGUE WILL PERMIT US TO REALIZE IN THE PROLIX FLESH NEURASTHENIA—OUR ESSENCE. . . .

NO NEED TO BELIEVE IN A TRUTH TO SUSTAIN IT NOR TO LOVE A PERIOD TO JUSTIFY IT EVERY PRINCIPLE BEING DEMONSTRABLE AND EVERY EVENT LEGITIMATE. THE SUM OF PHENOMENA—WHETHER FRUITS OF THE MIND OR OF TIME—CAN BE EMBRACED OR DENIED ACCORDING TO OUR MOOD OF THE MOMENT: ARGUMENTS PROCEEDING FROM OUR RIGOR OR FROM OUR WHIMS ARE OF EQUAL WEIGHT ON EACH POINT. NOTHING IS INDEFENSIBLE—FROM THE ABSURDEST PROPOSITION TO THE MOST MONSTROUS CRIME. THE HISTORY OF IDEAS LIKE THAT OF DEEDS UNFOLDS IN A MEANINGLESS CLIMATE; WHO COULD IN GOOD FAITH FIND AN ARBITER WHO WOULD SETTLE THE LITIGATIONS OF THESE ANEMIC OR BLOODTHIRSTY GORILLAS? THIS EARTH A PLACE WHERE WE CAN CONFIRM ANYTHING WITH AN EQUAL LIKELIHOOD: HERE AXIOMS AND FRENZIES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE; IMPULSES AND COLLAPSES ARE IDENTIFIED; EXALTATIONS AND DEPRAVITIES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME MOVEMENT. SHOW ME A SINGLE CASE IN SUPPORT OF WHICH NOTHING CAN BE FOUND. . . . THE ADVOCATES OF HELL HAVE NO FEWER CLAIMS ON THE TRUTH THAN THOSE OF HEAVEN—AND I SHOULD PLEAD THE CAUSE OF MADMAN AND SAGE WITH THE SAME FERVOR. TIME DEALS CORRUPTION TO ALL THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF ALL THAT ACTS: AN IDEA OR AN EVENT BECOMING REAL ASSUMES A COUNTENANCE AND . . . DISINTEGRATES. HENCE WHEN THE MOB OF BEINGS WAS STIRRED HISTORY WAS THE RESULT AND WITH IT THE ONE PURE DESIRE IT HAS INSPIRED: THAT IT COME TO AN END ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

TOO MATURE FOR NEW DAWNS AND HAVING INCLUDED TOO MANY CENTURIES TO CRAVE MORE ALL THAT REMAINS FOR US IS TO WALLOW IN THE SLAG OF CIVILIZATIONS. THE MARCH OF TIME NOW SEDUCES ONLY THE CALLOW AND THE FANATIC. . . .

WE ARE THE GREAT INVALIDS OVERWHELMED BY OLD DREAMS FOREVER INCAPABLE OF UTOPIA TECHNICIANS OF LASSITUDE GRAVEDIGGERS OF THE FUTURE HORRIFIED BY THE AVATARS OF THE OLD ADAM. THE TREE OF LIFE WILL NO LONGER HAVE SPRING AS ONE OF ITS SEASONS: SO MUCH DRY WOOD; OUT OF IT WILL BE MADE COFFINS FOR OUR BONES OUR DREAMS AND OUR GRIEFS. OUR FLESH INHERITED THE SMELL OF LOVELY CARRION SCATTERED IN THE MILLENNIA. THEIR GLORY FASCINATED US; WE EXHAUSTED IT. IN THE MIND’S GRAVEYARD LIE THE PRINCIPLES AND THE FORMULAS: THE BEAUTIFUL IS DEFINED AND INTERRED THERE. AND LIKE IT THE TRUE THE GOOD KNOWLEDGE AND THE GODS—THEY ARE ALL ROTTING THERE. (HISTORY: A CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CAPITAL LETTERS DECOMPOSE AND WITH THEM THE MEN WHO IMAGINE AND CHERISH THEM.)

.. . I STROLL THERE. UNDER THIS CROSS TRUTH SLEEPS ITS LAST SLEEP; BESIDE IT CHARM; FURTHER ON RIGOR; AND OVER A HOST OF SLABS COVERED WITH DELIRIUMS AND HYPOTHESES RISES THE MAUSOLEUM OF THE ABSOLUTE; IN IT LIE THE FALSE CONSOLATIONS AND THE DECEPTIVE ZENITHS OF THE SOUL. BUT STILL HIGHER CROWNING THIS SILENCE SOARS ERROR—AND HALTS THE STEPS OF THE FUNEREAL SOPHIST.

SINCE MAN’S EXISTENCE IS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AND THE STRANGEST VENTURE NATURE HAS KNOWN IT IS INEVITABLE THAT IT SHOULD ALSO BE THE SHORTEST; ITS END IS FORESEEABLE AND DESIRABLE: TO EXTEND IT INDEFINITELY WOULD BE INDECENT. HAVING ENTERED UPON THE RISKS OF HIS EXCEPTION THE PARADOXICAL ANIMAL WILL STILL PLAY FOR CENTURIES AND EVEN FOR MILLENNIA HIS LAST CARD MUST WE COMPLAIN OF THAT? NO QUESTION THAT HE WILL NEVER EQUAL HIS PAST GLORIES NOTHING SUGGESTS THAT HIS POSSIBILITIES WILL SOME DAY PROVOKE A RIVAL FOR BACH OR FOR SHAKESPEARE DECADENCE IS FIRST MANIFEST IN THE ARTS; “CIVILIZATION” SURVIVES THEIR DECOMPOSITION A CERTAIN TIME SUCH WILL BE MAN’S CASE: HE WILL CONTINUE HIS EXPLOITS BUT HIS SPIRITUAL RESOURCES WILL HAVE DRIED UP AS WILL HIS FRESHNESS OF INSPIRATION THE THIRST FOR POWER AND DOMINATION HAS TAKEN OVER TOO MUCH OF HIS SOUL: WHEN HE IS MASTER OF ALL HE WILL BE NONE THE MORE SO OF HIS OWE END. NOT YET BEING THE POSSESSOR OF ALL THE MEANS TO DESTROY AND TO DESTROY HIMSELF HE WILL NOT PERISH FORTHWITH; BUT IT IS INDUBITABLE THAT HE WILL CREATE FOR HIMSELF AN INSTRUMENT OF TOTAL ANNIHILATION BEFORE DISCOVERING A PANACEA WHICH MOREOVER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ONE OF NATURE’S POSSIBILITIES. HE WILL ANNIHILATE HIMSELF AS A CREATOR—ARE WE TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL MEN WILL VANISH FROM THE EARTH? WE MUST NOT LOOK AT THE SITUATION THROUGH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES. A GOOD PROPORTION THE SURVIVORS WILL LINGER ON A RACE OF SUBHUMANS GATE-CRASHERS OF THE APOCALYPSE . .

THE IMAGINATION READILY CONCEIVES A FUTURE IN WHICH MEN WILL EXCLAIM IN CHORUS: “WE ARE THE LAST: WEARY OF THE FUTURE AND EVEN WEARIER OF OURSELVES WE HAVE SQUEEZED OUT THE JUICE FROM THE EARTH AND STRIPPED BARE THE HEAVENS NEITHER SPIRIT NOR MATTER CAN STILL NOURISH OUR DREAMS: THIS UNIVERSE IS AS DESICCATED AS OUR HEARTS NO SUBSTANCE REMAINS ANYWHERE: OUR ANCESTORS BEQUEATHED US THEIR TATTERED SOUL AND THEIR WORM-EATEN MARROW. THE VENTURE IS AT AN END; CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXPIRING; OUR SONGS HAVE FALLEN STILL; THERE GLEAMS THE SUN OF THE DYING!”

IF BY ACCIDENT OR MIRACLE WORDS WERE TO DISAPPEAR WE SHOULD BE PLUNGED INTO AN INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND STUPOR. SUCH SUDDEN DUMBNESS WOULD EXPOSE US TO THE CRUDEST TORMENT. IT IS THE USE OF CONCEPTS WHICH MAKES US MASTERS OF OUR FEARS. WE SAY: DEATH—AND THIS ABSTRACTION RELEASES US FROM EXPERIENCING ITS INFINITY ITS HORROR. BY BAPTIZING EVENTS AND THINGS WE ELUDE THE INEXPLICABLE: THE MIND’S ACTIVITY IS A SALUTARY DECEPTION A CONJURING TRICK; IT ALLOWS US TO CIRCULATE IN A TEMPERED REALITY COMFORTABLE AND INEXACT. TO ¡EARN TO WIELD CONCEPTS—UNLEARN TO LOOK AT THINGS. . . . REFLECTION WAS BORN ON A DAY OF EVASION; THE CONSEQUENCE WAS VERBAL SPLENDOR. BUT WHEN WE RETURN TO OURSELVES AND WE ARE ALONE—-WITHOUT THE COMPANY OF WORDS—WE REDISCOVER THE UNQUALIFIED UNIVERSE THE PURE OBJECT THE NAKED EVENT; WHERE FIND THE BOLDNESS TO FACE THEM? WE NO LONGER SPECULATE ABOUT DEATH WE ARE DEATH; INSTEAD OF EMBELLISHING LIFE AND ASSIGNING IT GOALS WE STRIP IT OF ITS FINERY AND REDUCE IT TO ITS TRUE MEANING: A EUPHEMISM FOR EVIL THE GRAND EXPRESSIONS—FATE MISFORTUNE DISGRACE—LOSE THEIR LUSTER; AND IT IS THEN THAT WE SEE THE CREATURE AT GRIPS WITH FAILING ORGANS VANQUISHED UNDER A PROSTRATE AND DUMBFOUNDED SUBSTANCE. TAKE THE LIE OF MISERY AWAY FROM MAN GIVE HIM THE POWER TO LOOK UNDER THIS WORD: HE CANNOT FOR ONE MOMENT ENDURE HIS MISERY. IT IS ABSTRACTION SONORITIES WITHOUT CONTENT SWOLLEN AND DILAPIDATED WHICH HAVE KEPT HIM FROM FOUNDERING AND NOT HIS RELIGIONS AND INSTINCTS.

WHEN ADAM WAS EXPELLED FROM PARADISE INSTEAD OF VITUPERATING HIS PERSECUTOR HE BUSIED HIMSELF BAPTIZING THINGS: THIS WAS HIS SOLE WAY OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO THEM AND FORGETTING THEM; THE BASIS OF IDEALISM WAS ESTABLISHED. AND WHAT WAS ONLY A GESTURE A DEFENSE REACTION IN THE FIRST STAMMERER BECAME THEORY IN PLATO KANT AND HEGEL.

IN ORDER NOT TO BE OVERWHELMED BY OUR ACCIDENT WE CONVERT EVEN OUR NAME INTO AN ENTITY: HOW CAN WE DIE WHEN WE ARE CALLED PETER OR PAUL? EACH OF US MORE ATTENTIVE TO THE IMMUTABLE APPEARANCE OF HIS NAME THAN TO THE FRAGILITY OF HIS BEING GIVES HIMSELF UP TO AN ILLUSION OF IMMORTALITY; ONCE THE ARTICULATION BLURS WE ARE QUITE ALONE; THE MYSTIC WHO WEDS SILENCE HAS RENOUNCED HIS CREATURE CONDITION. IMAGINE HIM FURTHER WITHOUT FAITH—A NIHILIST MYSTIC—AND WE HAVE THE DISASTROUS CONSUMMATION OF THE EARTHLY VENTURE.

.. . IT IS ONLY TOO NATURAL TO THINK THAT MAN WEARY OF WORDS IMPATIENT WITH THE ITERATIONS OF TIME WILL DEBAPTIZE THINGS AND CAST THEIR NAMES AND HIS OWN INTO A GREAT AUTO-DA-FÉ THAT WILL ENGULF HIS HOPES. WE ALL RACE TOWARD THIS FINAL MODEL TOWARD MAN MUTE AND NAKED. . . .

I FEEL LIFE’S AGE ITS OLD AGE ITS DECREPITUDE. FOR INCALCULABLE EPOCHS LIFE HAS CIRCLED THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BY THE MIRACLE OF THAT FALSE IMMORTALITY WHICH IS INERTIA; IT HAS LINGERED IN THE RHEUMATISMS OF TIME IN THAT TIME OLDER THAN ITSELF EXHAUSTED BY A SENILE DELIRIUM BY THE ENDLESS SIFTING OF ITS MOMENTS OF ITS DOTING DURATION.

AND I FEEL ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE RACE AND I HAVE ASSUMED ALL ITS SOLITUDE. IF ONLY IT WOULD VANISH!—BUT ITS AGONY EXTENDS TOWARD AN ETERNITY OF CORRUPTION. I LEAVE EACH MOMENT THE LATITUDE TO DESTROY ME: NOT TO BLUSH AT BREATHING IS THE ACT OF A CAD. NO MORE PACTS WITH LIFE NO MORE PACTS WITH DEATH: HAVING UNLEARNED BEING I CONSENT TO BE EFFACED. BECOMING—WHAT A CRIME!

HAVING PASSED THROUGH SO MANY LUNGS THE AIR NO LONGER RENEWS ITSELF. EVERY DAY VOMITS UP ITS TOMORROW AND I VAINLY TRY TO IMAGINE THE IMAGE OF A SINGLE DESIRE. EVERYTHING IS AN ORDEAL: BROKEN DOWN LIKE A BEAST OF BURDEN HARNESSED TO MATTER I DRAG THE PLANETS.

GIVE ME ANOTHER UNIVERSE—OR I SUCCUMB.

ALL I LIKE IS THE EXPLOSION AND THE COLLAPSE OF THINGS THE FIRE WHICH PROVOKES THEM AND THE FIRE WHICH DEVOURS THEM. THE WORLD’S DURATION EXASPERATES ME; ITS BIRTH AND ITS DISAPPEARANCE DELIGHT. .. . TO LIVE UNDER THE FASCINATION OF THE VIRGINAL SUN AND THE DECREPIT ONE; TO SKIP THE PULSATIONS OF TIME IN ORDER TO GRASP THE ORIGINAL ONE AND THE ULTIMATE .. . TO DREAM OF THE IMPROVISATION OF THE STARS AND OF THEIR EXTINCTION; TO DISDAIN THE ROUTINE OF BEING AND TO RUSH TOWARD THE TWO ABYSSES WHICH THREATEN IT; TO EXHAUST ONESELF AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MOMENTS. . .

THUS ONE DISCOVERS THE SAVAGE AND THE DECADENT IN ONESELF A PREDESTINED AND CONTRADICTORY COHABITATION: TWO CHARACTERS SUFFERING THE SAME ATTRACTION FOR PASSAGE THE ONE OF NOTHINGNESS TOWARD THE WORLD THE OTHER OF THE WORLD TOWARD NOTHINGNESS: IT IS THE NEED FOR A DOUBLE CONVULSION ON THE METAPHYSICAL SCALE. THIS NEED IS EXPRESSED ON THE HISTORICAL SCALE IN THE OBSESSION OF ADAM WHOM PARADISE EXPELLED AND IN THE OBSESSION OF THE MAN WHOM EARTH WILL EXPEL: TWO EXTREMITIES OF MAN’S IMPOSSIBILITY.

BY WHAT IS “PROFOUND” IN US WE ARE VICTIMS OF EVERY EVIL: NO SALVATION SO LONG AS WE STILL CONFORM TO OUR BEING. SOMETHING MUST DISAPPEAR FROM OUR COMPOSITION SOME DEADLY SPRING DRY UP; HENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OUT: TO ABOLISH THE SOUL ITS ASPIRATIONS AND ABYSSES; OUR DREAMS WERE POISONED BY IT; WE MUST EXTIRPATE IT ALONG WITH ITS CRAVING FOR “DEPTH” ITS “INNER” FRUITFULNESS AND ITS OTHER ABERRATIONS. THE MIND AND SENSATION WILL SUFFICE; THEIR CONCOURSE WILL BEGET A DISCIPLINE OF STERILITY WHICH WILL PRESERVE US FROM ENTHUSIASM FROM ANGUISH. LET NO “FEELING” DISTURB US EVER AGAIN AND LET THE “SOUL” BECOME THE SILLIEST OF DESUETUDES. . . .

SANCTITY AND THE GRIMACES OF THE ABSOLUTE
THE REFUSAL TO PROCREATE—THE AESTHETE HAGIOGRAPHER—THE DISCIPLE OF CERTAIN SAINTS—WISDOM AND SANCTITY—WOMAN AND THE ABSOLUTE—SPAIN HYSTERIA OF ETERNITY—STAGES OF PRIDE—HEAVEN AND HYGIENE—ON CERTAIN SOLITUDES—OSCILLATION THREAT OF SANCTITY—THE TILTING CROSS—THEOLOGY—THE METAPHYSICAL ANIMAL—GENESIS OF MELANCHOLY—DIVAGATIONS IN A MONASTERY EXERCISE OF INSUBMISSION

YES TRULY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DEMONS ARE PLAYING HALL WITH MY SOUL . . .

—TERESA OF AVILA

THE REFUSAL TO PROCREATE
HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS APPETITES THE MAN WHO APPROACHES A LIMIT-FORM OF DETACHMENT NO LONGER WANTS TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF; HE LOATHES SURVIVING IN SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM MOREOVER HE HAS NOTHING MORE TO TRANSMIT; THE SPECIES APPALLS HIM; HE IS A MONSTER—AND MONSTERS DO NOT BEGET. “LOVE” STILL HOLDS HIM PRISONER: AN ABERRATION AMONG HIS THOUGHTS. IN LOVE HE SEEKS AN EXCUSE TO RETURN TO THE COMMON CONDITION; BUT THE CHILD SEEMS AS INCONCEIVABLE TO HIM AS THE FAMILY AS HEREDITY AS THE LAWS OF NATURE. WITH NEITHER PROFESSION NOR LINEAGE HE ACHIEVES—FINAL HYPOSTASIS—HIS OWN CONCLUSION. BUT FAR AS HE MAY BE FROM FECUNDITY A MORE AUDACIOUS MONSTER OUTSTRIPS HIM: THE SAINT AN EXAMPLE AT ONCE FASCINATING AND REPELLENT WITH WHOM WE ARE ALWAYS IN A FALSE POSITION; HIS OWN IS CLEAR: NO ROOM FOR DOUBT NO POSSIBLE DILETTANTISM. HAVING REACHED THE GILDED PEAKS OF HIS DISGUSTS AT THE ANTIPODES OF CREATION HE HAS MADE HIS NOTHINGNESS INTO A HALO. NATURE HAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH A CALAMITY: FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF PERPETUATION THE SAINT MARKS AN ABSOLUTE END A RADICAL DENOUEMENT. TO REGRET LIKE LÉON BLOY THAT WE ARE NOT ALL SAINTS IS TO CRAVE HUMANITY’S DISAPPEARANCE . . . IN THE NAME OF FAITH! HOW POSITIVE ON THE OTHER HAND THE DEVIL APPEARS STRIVING TO SEAL US TO OUR IMPERFECTIONS AND LABORING—DESPITE HIMSELF BETRAYING HIS ESSENCE—TO PRESERVE US! ROOT OUT SINS AND LIFE WITHERS AT ONCE. THE FOLLIES OF PROCREATION WILL ONE DAY VANISH—OUT OF WEARINESS RATHER THAN SANCTITY. MAN WILL BE EXHAUSTED LESS FOR HAVING TENDED TO PERFECTION THAN FOR HAVING SQUANDERED HIMSELF; THEN HE WILL RESEMBLE A VOID SAINT AND HE WILL BE JUST AS FAR FROM NATURE’S FRUITFULNESS AS IS THIS MODEL OF FULFILLMENT AND STERILITY.

MAN ENGENDERS ONLY BY REMAINING FAITHFUL TO THE GENERAL FATE. ONCE HE APPROACHES THE ESSENCE OF THE DEVIL OR OF THE ANGEL HE BECOMES STERILE OR BEGETS ABORTIONS. FOR EASKOLEIKOV FOR IVAN KARAMAZOV OR STAVROGIN LOVE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN EXCUSE TO ACCELERATE THEIR DESTRUCTION; AND THIS VERY EXCUSE VANISHES FOR KIRILOV: HE NO LONGER MEASURES HIMSELF AGAINST MEN BUT AGAINST GOD AS FOR THE IDIOT OR ALYOSHA THE FACT THAT THE ONE APES JESUS AND THE OTHER THE ANGELS PLACES THEM FROM THE START AMONG THE IMPOTENT . . .

BUT TO WREST OURSELVES FROM THE CHAIN OF BEINGS AND TO REJECT THE NOTION OF ANCESTRY OR POSTERITY IS NONETHELESS NOT TO COMPETE WITH THE SAINT WHOSE PRIDE EXCEEDS ANY EARTHLY DIMENSION. INDEED UNDER THE DECISION BY WHICH HE RENOUNCES EVERYTHING UNDER THE INCOMMENSURABLE EXPLOIT OF SUCH HUMILITY IS CONCEALED A DEMONIC EFFERVESCENCE: THE INITIAL POINT THE START OF SANCTITY ASSUMES THE STYLE OF A CHALLENGE HURLED AT THE HUMAN RACE; SUBSEQUENTLY THE SAINT CLIMBS THE LADDER OF PERFECTION BEGINS TALKING ABOUT LOVE ABOUT GOD TURNS TOWARD THE HUMBLE INTRIGUES THE MOB—AND ANNOYS US. THE FACT NONETHELESS REMAINS THAT HE HAS THROWN DOWN HIS GAUNTLET. . . .

THE HATRED OF THE “RACE” AND OF ITS “GENIUS” RELATES YOU TO MURDERERS TO MADMEN TO DIVINITIES AND TO ALL THE GREAT FORMS OF THE STERILE. STARTING FROM A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SOLITUDE YOU MUST LEAVE OFF LOVING AND COMMITTING THE FASCINATING POLLUTION OF INTERCOURSE. THE MAN WHO WANTS TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF AT ANY PRICE IS SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE DOG: HE IS STILL NATURE; HE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN ENDURE THE EMPIRE OF THE INSTINCTS AND REBEL AGAINST THEM ENJOY THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIES AND SCORN THEM: END OF THE LINE—WITH APPETITES. . . . THAT IS THE CONFLICT OF THE MAN WHO WORSHIPS AND ABOMINATES WOMAN SUPREMELY TORN BETWEEN THE ATTRACTION AND DISGUST SHE INSPIRES. HENCE UNABLE TO RENOUNCE THE RACE ALTOGETHER HE RESOLVES THIS CONFLICT BY DREAMING ON HER BREAST OF THE DESERT AND BY MINGLING THE SCENT OF THE CLOISTERS WITH THE STENCH OF OVER-EXPLICIT SWEAT. THE INSINCERITIES OF THE FLESH BRING HIM CLOSER TO THE SAINTS. . . .

SOLITUDE OF HATRED . . . SENSATION OF A GOD TURNED TOWARD DESTRUCTION TREADING THE SPHERES UNDERFOOT SLOBBERING ON THE BLUE OF HEAVEN AND ITS CONSTELLATIONS . . . OF A FRENZIED FILTHY UNHEALTHY GOD; THE DEMIURGE EJECTING THROUGH SPACE PARADISE AND LATRINES; COSMOGONY OF DELIRIUM TREMENS; CONVULSIVE APOTHEOSIS IN WHICH GALL CONSUMMATES THE ELEMENTS. . . . THE CREATURES HURL THEMSELVES TOWARD AN ARCHETYPE OF UGLINESS AND SIGH FOR AN IDEAL OF DEFORMITY.

. . . UNIVERSE OF GRIMACES JUBILATION OF THE MOLE THE HYENA AND THE LOUSE. . . . NO HORIZON LEFT EXCEPT FOR MONSTERS AND VERMIN. EVERYTHING MAKES FOR DISGUST AND GANGRENE: THIS GLOBE SUPPURATING WHILE THE LIVING DISPLAY THEIR WOUNDS UNDER THE BEAMS OF THAT LUMINOUS CHANCRE. . . .

THE AESTHETE HAGIOGRAPHER
IT IS NO SIGN OF BENEDICTION TO HAVE BEEN HAUNTED BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SAINTS. THIS OBSESSION IS TAINTED BY A THIRST FOR DISEASES AND A GREED FOR DEPRAVITIES. YOU ARE DISTURBED ABOUT SANCTITY ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY THE EARTHLY PARADOXES; SO THEN YOU SEARCH FOR OTHERS OF A STRANGER PURPORT IMBUED WITH UNKNOWN PERFUMES AND TRUTHS; YOU PUT YOUR HOPES IN FOLLIES NOT TO BE FOUND IN EVERYDAY SENSATIONS FOLLIES HEAVY WITH A CELESTIAL EXOTICISM; AND SO YOU COME UP AGAINST THE SAINTS THEIR GESTURES THEIR TEMERITY THEIR UNIVERSE. ASTOUNDING SPECTACLE! YOU VOW TO REMAIN HERE ALL YOUR LIFE TO EXAMINE IT WITH A VOLUPTUOUS DEVOTION TO WREST YOURSELF FROM OTHER TEMPTATIONS BECAUSE AT LAST YOU HAVE MET WITH THE TRUE AND THE UNHEARD OF. BEHOLD THE AESTHETE TURNED HAGIOGRAPHER MAKING HIS SCHOLARLY PILGRIMAGE. . . . HE MAKES IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT IT IS NO MORE THAN A PROMENADE AND THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD DISAPPOINTS EVEN SANCTITY. . . .

THE DISCIPLE OF CERTAIN SAINTS
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TO PRONOUNCE MERELY THE NAME OF A SAINT A SAINT WHO HAPPENED TO BE A WOMAN FILLED ME WITH PLEASURE—WHEN I ENVIED THE CHRONICLERS OF THE CONVENTS THE INTIMATES OF SO MANY INEFFABLE HYSTERIAS SO MANY ILLUMINATIONS AND PALLORS. I CONSIDERED THAT TO BE THE SECRETARY OF SUCH A WOMAN SUCH A SAINT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE HIGHEST CAREER A MORTAL MAN COULD ENJOY. AND I WOULD COVET THE CONFESSOR’S ROLE AMONG THESE BLESSED ENTHUSIASTS AND ALL THE DETAILS ALL THE SECRETS A PETER OF ALVASTRA KEPT FROM US ABOUT SAINT BRIDGET OF SWEDEN HENRY OF NORDLINGEN ABOUT MECHTHILD OF MAGDEBURG RAYMOND OF CAPUA ABOUT CATHERINE OF SIENA BROTHER ARNOLD ABOUT ANGELA OF FOLIGNO JOHANN OF MARIENWERDER ABOUT DOROTHEA OF MONTAU CLEMENS BRENTANO ABOUT CATHERINE EMMERICH. . . . IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A DIODATA DEGLI ADEMARI OR A DIANA OF ANDOLO ROSE UP TO HEAVEN BY THE SIMPLE GLAMOR OF THEIR NAMES: THEY GAVE ME THE SENSUAL TASTE FOR ANOTHER WORLD.

WHEN I MUSED ON THE ORDEALS OF ROSE OF LIMA OF LYDWINA OF SCHIEDAM OF CATHERINE DEI RICCI AND OF SO MANY OTHERS WHEN I THOUGHT OF THEIR REFINEMENT OF CRUELTY TOWARD THEMSELVES OF THE DELIBERATE MORTIFICATION OF THEIR CHARMS AND GRACES—1 DETESTED THE PARASITE OF THEIR PANGS THE UNSCRUPULOUS BRIDEGROOM INSATIABLE AND CELESTIAL DON JUAN WHO HAD THE RIGHT OF FIRST TENANT IN THEIR HEARTS. EXASPERATED BY THE SIGHS AND SWEATS OF EARTHLY LOVE I TURNED TO THESE WOMEN IF ONLY FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF ANOTHER MODE OF LOVING. “IF BUT ONE DROP OF WHAT I FEEL” SAID CATHERINE OF GENOA “WERE TO FALL INTO HELL IT WOULD FORTHWITH TRANSFORM HELL INTO PARADISE.” I WAITED FOR THAT DROP WHICH HAD IT FALLEN WOULD HAVE FOUND ME AT THE END OF ITS TRAJECTORY. . . .

MURMURING OVER THE EXCLAMATIONS OF TERESA OF AVILA I HEARD HER CRYING AT THE AGE OF SIX “ETERNITY ETERNITY” THEN FOLLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER DELIRIUMS OF HER DEVOTIONS OF HER DESICCATIONS. NOTHING MORE CAPTIVATING THAN THE PRIVATE REVELATIONS WHICH DISCONCERT THE DOGMAS AND EMBARRASS THE CHURCH. . . . I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO KEEP A JOURNAL OF THOSE EQUIVOCAL AVOWALS TO BROWSE ON ALL THOSE SUSPECT NOSTALGIAS. .. . IT IS NOT IN A BED THAT THE PEAKS OF VOLUPTUOUS PLEASURE ARE TO BE SCALED: HOW FIND IN MERE SUBLUNARY ECSTASY WHAT THE SAINTS LET YOU SUSPECT IN THEIR RAVISHMENT IN THEIR TRANSPORTS? BERNINI HAS SHOWN US THE QUALITY OF THEIR SECRETS IN HIS STATUE OF THE SPANISH SAINT IN ROME WHERE TERESA INCITES US TO SO MANY CONSIDERATIONS AS TO THE AMBIGUITY OF HER SWOONS. . . .

WHEN I THINK AGAIN ABOUT MY DEBTS FOR AN AWARENESS OF THESE EXTREMITIES OF PASSION THESE DARKEST YET PUREST RAPTURES AND THAT KIND OF ABSENCE WHEN THE NIGHTS CATCH FIRE WHEN THE MEREST BLADE OF GRASS LIKE THE STARS THEMSELVES DISSOLVES INTO A VOICE OF TONIC INTENSITY—INSTANTANEOUS INFINITY INCANDESCENT AND SONOROUS AS A RADIANT AND DEMENTED GOD MIGHT CONCEIVE IT—WHEN I THINK AGAIN ABOUT ALL THIS A SINGLE NAME HAUNTS ME: TERESA OF AVILA—AND THE WORDS OF ONE OF HER REVELATIONS I USED TO REPEAT TO MYSELF DAILY: “YOU MUST NO LONGER SPEAK WITH MEN BUT WITH ANGELS.”

I LIVED FOR YEARS IN THE SHADOW OF THESE WOMEN THESE SAINTS BELIEVING THAT NO POET SAGE OR MADMAN WOULD EVER EQUAL THEM. I EXPENDED IN MY FERVOR FOR THEM ALL MY POWERS OF WORSHIP MY VITALITY IN DESIRE MY ARDOR IN DREAMS. AND THEN . . . I STOPPED LOVING THEM.

WISDOM AND SANCTITY
OF ALL THE GREAT SUFFERERS THE SAINTS ARE BEST AT PROFITING FROM THEIR SICKNESS. WILLFUL UNBRIDLED NATURES THEY EXPLOIT THEIR OWN DISEQUILIBRIUM WITH VIOLENCE AND SKILL. THE SAVIOR THEIR MODEL WAS AN EXAMPLE OF AMBITION AND AUDACITY A MATCHLESS CONQUEROR: HIS INSINUATING FORCE HIS POWER TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THE SOUL’S FLAWS AND INSUFFICIENCIES ALLOWED HIM TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY MERE SWORD. ARDENT WITH METHOD: IT IS THIS ABILITY WHICH WAS IMITATED BY THOSE WHO TOOK HIM FOR THEIR IDEAL.

BUT THE SAGE SCORNFUL OF DRAMA AND DISPLAY FEELS QUITE AS REMOTE FROM THE SAINT AS FROM THE REVELER KNOWS NOTHING OF THE HISTRIONIC AND FORGES FOR HIMSELF AN EQUILIBRIUM OF DISILLUSION AND UNCONCERN. PASCAL IS A SAINT WITHOUT TEMPERAMENT: SICKNESS HAS MADE HIM A LITTLE MORE THAN A SAGE A LITTLE LESS THAN A SAINT. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR HIS OSCILLATIONS AND THE SKEPTICAL SHADOW THAT FOLLOWS HIS FERVORS. A BEL ESPRIT IN THE INCURABLE. . . .

FROM THE SAGE’S VIEWPOINT THERE CAN BE NO ONE MORE IMPURE THAN THE SAINT; FROM THE SAINT’S NO ONE EMPTIER THAN THE SAGE. HERE WE HAVE THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS AND THE MAN WHO ASPIRES.

WOMAN AND THE ABSOLUTE
“WHILE OUR LORD SPOKE TO ME AND I CONTEMPLATED HIS MARVELOUS BEAUTY I NOTICED THE SWEETNESS AND AT TIMES THE SEVERITY WITH WHICH HIS LOVELY AND DIVINE LIPS UTTERED THE WORDS. I DESIRED ARDENTLY TO KNOW THE COLOR OF HIS EYES AND THE PROPORTIONS OF HIS STATURE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK OF THEM: BUT NEVER HAVE I DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE. ALL EFFORT TO THAT END IS OF NO AVAIL."—SAINT TERESA.

THE COLOR OF HIS EYES. . . . IMPURITIES OF FEMALE SANCTITY! TO CARRY THE INDISCRETION OF HER SEX UP TO HEAVEN ITSELF—THAT IS OF A NATURE TO CONSOLE AND COMPENSATE ANY MAN—AND BETTER STILL ANY WOMAN—WHO HAS REMAINED OUTSIDE THE DIVINE ADVENTURE. THE FIRST MAN THE FIRST WOMAN: THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE FALL WHICH NOTHING GENIUS NOR SANCTITY WILL EVER REDEEM. WHO HAS EVER SEEN A NEW MAN TOTALLY SUPERIOR TO THE ONE HE WAS? FOR JESUS HIMSELF THE TRANSFIGURATION MAY HAVE MEANT ONLY A FUGITIVE EVENT A DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. . . .

BETWEEN SAINT TERESA AND OTHER WOMEN THEN THERE IS NO MORE THAN A DIFFERENCE IN CAPACITY FOR DELIRIUM A QUESTION OF THE INTENSITY AND DIRECTION OF CAPRICE. LOVE—HUMAN OR DIVINE—LEVELS HUMAN BEINGS: TO LOVE A GIRL OR TO LOVE GOD PRESUPPOSES THE SAME MOVEMENT: IN BOTH CASES YOU FOLLOW A CREATURELY IMPULSE. ONLY THE OBJECT CHANGES; BUT WHAT INTEREST DOES IT OFFER ONCE IT IS MERELY A PRETEXT FOR THE NEED TO WORSHIP ONCE GOD IS MERELY ONE OUTLET AMONG SO MANY OTHERS?

SPAIN
EACH NATION TRANSLATES THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES INTO PROCESS IN ITS OWN WAY YET SPAIN’S ARDOR REMAINS UNIQUE; HAD THE REST OF THE WORLD SHARED IT GOD WOULD BE EXHAUSTED DRAINED AND DEPRIVED OF HIMSELF. IT IS IN ORDER NOT TO VANISH THAT HE MAKES ATHEISM PROSPER IN HIS COUNTRIES—OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE. FEARING THE FLAMES HE HAS INSPIRED HE REACTS AGAINST HIS SONS AGAINST THEIR FRENZY WHICH DIMINISHES HIM; THEIR LOVE UNDERMINES HIS POWER AND HIS AUTHORITY; ONLY UNBELIEF LEAVES HIM INTACT; IT IS NOT DOUBTS WHICH ERODE GOD BUT FAITH. FOR CENTURIES THE CHURCH HAS TRIVIALIZED HIS PRESTIGE AND BY MAKING HIM ACCESSIBLE IS PREPARING FOR HIM THANKS TO THEOLOGY A DEATH WITHOUT ENIGMAS A GLOSSED ENLIGHTENED AGONY: OVERWHELMED BY THE WEIGHT OF PRAYERS HOW COULD HE HELP BEING STILL MORE SO BY THAT OF EXPLANATIONS? HE DREADS SPAIN AS HE DREADS RUSSIA—AND MULTIPLIES ATHEISTS IN BOTH. THEIR ATTACKS AT LEAST LET HIM RETAIN THE ILLUSION OF OMNIPOTENCE: STILL AN ATTRIBUTE PRESERVED! BUT THE BELIEVERS! DOSTOYEVSKY EL GRECO: HAS HE EVER HAD MORE FEVERISH ENEMIES? AND HOW COULD HE KEEP FROM PREFERRING BAUDELAIRE TO JOHN OF THE CROSS? HE FEARS THOSE WHO SEE HIM AND THOSE THROUGH WHOM HE SEES.

ALL SANCTITY IS MORE OR LESS SPANISH: IF GOD WERE A CYCLOPS SPAIN WOULD BE HIS EYE.

HYSTERIA OF ETERNITY
I CAN CONCEDE A CERTAIN RELISH FOR THE CROSS BUT TO REPRODUCE AND DAILY THE STALE EVENT OF CALVARY—THAT PARTAKES OF THE WONDROUS THE INANE AND THE STUPID. FOR AFTER ALL THE SAVIOR IF WE ABUSE HIS PRESTIGE IS AS TIRESOME AS ANYONE ELSE.

THE SAINTS WERE GREAT PERVERTS THE WOMEN AMONG THEM MAGNIFICENT VOLUPTUARIES. ALL OF THEM—FRENZIED BY A SINGLE IDEA TRANSFORMED THE CROSS INTO A VICE. “DEPTH” IS THE DIMENSION OF THOSE WHO CANNOT VARY THEIR THOUGHTS AND THEIR APPETITES AND WHO EXPLORE A SINGLE REGION OF PLEASURE AND OF PAIN.

ATTENTIVE TO THE FLUCTUATION OF THE MOMENTS WE CANNOT ADMIT AN ABSOLUTE EVENT: JESUS CANNOT CUT HISTORY IN TWO NOR THE RAISING OF THE CROSS BREAK THE IMPARTIAL COURSE OF TIME. RELIGIOUS THOUGHT—A FORM OF OBSESSIVE THOUGHT—SUBTRACTS A TEMPORAL PORTION FROM THE SUM OF EVENTS AND INVESTS IT WITH ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNCONDITIONED. THIS IS HOW THE GODS AND THEIR SONS WERE POSSIBLE. . . .

LIFE IS THE SITE OF MY INFATUATIONS: EVERYTHING I WREST FROM INDIFFERENCE I GIVE BACK ALMOST AT ONCE. THIS IS NOT THE SAINTS' METHOD: THEY CHOOSE ONCE AND FOR ALL. I LIVE IN ORDER TO LEAVE OFF WHATEVER I LOVE; THEY IN ORDER TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A SINGLE OBJECT; I SAVOR ETERNITY THEY SINK THEMSELVES INTO IT.

THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH—AND A FORTIORI THOSE OF HEAVEN—RESULT FROM A DURABLE HYSTERIA. SANCTITY: EARTHQUAKE OF THE HEART ANNIHILATION BY DINT OF BELIEF CULMINATING EXPRESSION OF FANATIC SENSIBILITY TRANSCENDENT DEFORMITY. . . . BETWEEN THE SAVED AND THE SIMPLE-MINDED THERE IS MORE CORRESPONDENCE THAN BETWEEN THE SAVED AND THE SKEPTIC. THAT IS THE ENTIRE DISTANCE WHICH DIVIDES FAITH FROM KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT HOPE FROM EXISTENCE WITHOUT RESULTS.

STAGES OF PRIDE
FREQUENTING THE SAINTS' MADNESS YOU HAPPEN TO FORGET YOUR LIMITS YOUR CHAINS YOUR BURDENS AND YOU EXCLAIM: “I AM THE SOUL OF THE WORLD; I COLOR THE UNIVERSE WITH MY FLAMES. THERE WILL BE NO NIGHT FROM NOW ON: I HAVE PREPARED THE ETERNAL BANQUET OF THE STARS; THE SUN IS SUPERFLUOUS: EVERYTHING SHINES AND THE STONES ARE LIGHTER THAN ANGELS' WINGS.”

THEN BETWEEN FRENZY AND CONTEMPLATION: “IF I AM NOT THIS SOUL AT LEAST I ASPIRE TO BE IT. HAVE I NOT GIVEN MY NAME TO ALL THINGS? EVERY OBJECT PROCLAIMS ME FROM THE DUNGHEAPS TO THE VAULTS OF HEAVEN: AM I NOT THE SILENCE AND THE DIN OF THINGS?”

. . . AND AT THE LOWEST THE INTOXICATION PAST: “I AM THE GRAVE OF SPARKS THE WORMS' MOCKERY A CARRION IMPORTUNING HEAVEN A CARNIVAL PARODY OF THE BEYOND A CI-DEVANT NOTHING WITHOUT EVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF EVER HAVING ROTTED. WHAT PERFECTION OF THE ABYSS HAVE I COME TO THAT THERE IS NO SPACE LEFT FOR ME TO FALL IN?”

HEAVEN AND HYGIENE
SANCTITY: SUPREME PRODUCT OF DISEASE; WHEN WE ARE WELL IT SEEMS MONSTROUS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND MORBID TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. BUT LET THAT AUTOMATIC HAMLETISM WE CALL NEUROSIS CLAIM ITS DUES AND THE HEAVENS TAKE SHAPE AND CONSTITUTE THE CONTEXT OF ANXIETY. WE PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST SANCTITY BY TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES: IT PROCEEDS FROM A SPECIAL FILTH OF THE BODY AND OF THE SOUL. IF CHRISTIANITY HAD PROPOSED HYGIENE INSTEAD OF THE UNVERIFIABLE WE SHOULD SEEK IN VAIN FOR A SINGLE SAINT IN ALL ITS HISTORY; BUT IT HAS CHAMPIONED OUR WOUNDS AND OUR SQUALOR AN INTRINSIC PHOSPHORESCENT SQUALOR. . . .

HEALTH: DECISIVE WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION INVENT THE UNIVERSAL ELIXIR: THE HEAVENS WILL VANISH AND NEVER RETURN. NO USE SEDUCING MAN BY OTHER IDEALS: THEY WILL BE WEAKER THAN DISEASES GOD IS OUR RUST THE GRADUAL DECAY OF OUR SUBSTANCE: WHEN HE PENETRATES US WE THINK WE ARE ELEVATED BUT WE DESCEND LOWER AND LOWER; HAVING REACHED OUR END HE CROWNS OUR COLLAPSE AND SO WE ARE “SAVED” FOREVER. SINISTER SUPERSTITION HALOED CANCER WHICH HAS EATEN AWAY THE EARTH FOR AGES. . . .

I HATE ALL GODS; I AM NOT HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SCORN THEM. THAT IS THE INDIFFERENT MAN’S GREAT HUMILIATION.

ON CERTAIN SOLITUDES
THERE ARE HEARTS GOD CANNOT LOOK INTO WITHOUT LOSING HIS INNOCENCE. SADNESS BEGAN AFTER THE CREATION: HAD THE CREATOR VENTURED FURTHER INTO THE WORLD HE WOULD HAVE COMPROMISED HIS EQUILIBRIUM. THE MAN WHO BELIEVES HE CAN STILL DIE HAS NOT KNOWN CERTAIN SOLITUDES NOR THE INEVITABILITY OF IMMORTALITY PERCEIVED IN CERTAIN PANGS. . . .

IT IS OUR MODERN SPECIALTY TO HAVE LOCALIZED HELL IN OURSELVES: HAD WE PRESERVED ITS OLD COUNTENANCE FEAR SUSTAINED BY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF THREATS WOULD HAVE PETRIFIED US. THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY DREADS WHICH ARE NOT TRANSPOSED SUBJECTIVELY: PSYCHOLOGY IS OUR SALVATION OUR SUBTERFUGE. IN THE OLD DAYS THIS WORLD WAS SUPPOSED TO EMERGE FROM ONE OF THE DEVIL’S YAWNS; TODAY IT IS ONLY A MISTAKE OF THE SENSES A PREJUDICE OF THE MIND A VICE OF THE EMOTIONS. WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH SAINT HILDEGARDE’S VISION OF THE LAST JUDGMENT OR SAINT TERESA’S OF HELL; THE SUBLIME—THE SUBLIME OF HORROR LIKE THAT OF HOLINESS—IS CLASSIFIED BY ANY TREATISE ON MENTAL DISEASES. AND IF OUR ILLS ARE KNOWN TO US WE ARE NOT THEREBY EXEMPT FROM VISIONS BUT WE NO LONGER BELIEVE IN THEM. EXPERT IN THE CHEMISTRY OF MYSTERIES WE EXPLAIN EVERYTHING EVEN OUR TEARS. THIS HOWEVER REMAINS INEXPLICABLE: IF THE SOUL IS OF SUCH LITTLE ACCOUNT WHERE DOES THE FEELING OF OUR SOLITUDE COME FROM? WHAT SPACE DOES IT OCCUPY? AND HOW DOES IT SUDDENLY REPLACE THE HUGE VANISHED REALITY?

OSCILLATION
IN VAIN YOU SEARCH FOR YOUR MODEL AMONG HUMAN BEINGS; FROM THOSE WHO HAVE GONE FARTHER THAN YOU YOU HAVE BORROWED ONLY THE COMPROMISING AND HARMFUL ASPECT: FROM THE SAGE SLOTH; FROM THE SAINT INCOHERENCE; FROM THE AESTHETE RANCOR; FROM THE POET PROFLIGACY—AND FROM ALL DISAGREEMENT WITH YOURSELF AMBIGUITY IN EVERYDAY THINGS AND HATRED FOR WHAT LIVES SIMPLY TO LIVE. PURE YOU REGRET FILTH; SORDID SEEMLINESS; VAGUE VIGOR. YOU WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT WHAT YOU ARE NOT AND THE DESPAIR OF BEING WHAT YOU ARE. WITH WHAT CONTRASTS WAS YOUR SUBSTANCE IMBUED AND WHAT MINGLED GENIUS PRESIDED OVER YOUR RELEGATION IN THE WORLD? DETERMINATION TO DIMINISH YOURSELF HAS MADE YOU ESPOUSE IN OTHERS THEIR APPETITE FOR COLLAPSE: IN THIS MUSICIAN THIS DISEASE; IN THIS PROPHET THIS DEFECT; AND IN WOMEN—POETS LIBERTINES OR SAINTS—THEIR MELANCHOLY THEIR VITIATED SPIRITS THEIR CORRUPTION OF FLESH AND BLOOD AND DREAMS. BITTERNESS PRINCIPLE OF YOUR DETERMINATION YOUR MODE OF ACTION AND UNDERSTANDING IS THE ONE FIXED POINT IN YOUR OSCILLATION BETWEEN DISGUST FOR THE WORLD AND SELF-PITY.

THREAT OF SANCTITY
ABLE TO LIVE ONLY BEYOND OR SHORT OF LIFE MAN IS A PREY TO TWO TEMPTATIONS: IMBECILITY AND SANCTITY: SUB-MAN AND SUPERMAN NEVER HIMSELF. BUT WHEREAS HE DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THE FEAR OF BEING LESS THAN WHAT HE IS THE PROSPECT OF BEING MORE TERRIFIES HIM. COMMITTED TO PAIN HE DREADS ITS CONCLUSION: HOW COULD HE CONSENT TO FOUNDER IN THAT ABYSS OF PERFECTION WHICH IS SANCTITY AND THERE LOSE HIS OWN CONTROL? TO SLIDE TOWARD IMBECILITY OR TOWARD SANCTITY IS TO LET YOURSELF BE LURED OUTSIDE YOURSELF. YET WE ARE NOT ALARMED BY THE LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS IMPLIED BY THE APPROACH OF IDIOCY WHILE THE PROSPECT OF PERFECTION IS INSEPARABLE FROM VERTIGO. IT IS BY IMPERFECTION THAT WE ARE SUPERIOR TO GOD; AND IT IS THE FEAR OF LOSING IT WHICH MAKES US FLEE SANCTITY! THE TERROR OF A FUTURE IN WHICH WE SHALL NO LONGER BE IN DESPAIR .. . IN WHICH AT THE TERM OF OUR DISASTERS ANOTHER UNLONGED FOR WOULD APPEAR—DIE TERROR OF SALVATION THE TERROR OF BECOMING SAINTS. . . .

THE MAN WHO ADORES HIS IMPERFECTIONS IS FRIGHTENED OF A TRANSFIGURATION WHICH HIS SUFFERINGS MIGHT PREPARE FOR HIM. TO VANISH IN A TRANSCENDENT LIGHT. . . . BETTER THEN TO MAKE FOR THE ABSOLUTE OF DARKNESS TOWARD THE COMFORTS OF IMBECILITY. . . .

THE TILTING CROSS
SUBLIME HODGEPODGE CHRISTIANITY IS TOO PROFOUND-—AND ABOVE ALL TOO IMPURE—TO LAST ANY LONGER: ITS CENTURIES ARE NUMBERED. JESUS FADES FROM DAY TO DAY; HIS PRECEPTS LIKE HIS MILDNESS VEX; HIS MIRACLES AND HIS DIVINITY MAKE US SMILE. THE CROSS TILTS: THE SYMBOL IS TURNING BACK INTO SUBSTANCE . . . BACK INTO THE ORDER OF THAT DECOMPOSITION IN WHICH WITHOUT EXCEPTION HONORABLE AND UNWORTHY THINGS DIE. TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF SUCCESS! A FABULOUS RESIGNATION ON THE PART OF THE MOST FRETFUL ANIMAL OF ALL . . . BUT OUR PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED. THE NOTION THAT I COULD—LIKE EVERYONE ELSE—BE SINCERELY CHRISTIAN IF ONLY A SECOND CASTS ME INTO PERPLEXITY. THE SAVIOR BORES ME. I DREAM OF A UNIVERSE EXEMPT FROM CELESTIAL INTOXICATIONS OF A UNIVERSE WITH NEITHER CROSS NOR FAITH.

WHO CAN FAIL TO SEE THE MOMENT COMING WHEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE RELIGION WHEN MAN LUCID AND EMPTY WILL HAVE NO WORD ON HAND TO DESIGNATE HIS ABYSS? THE UNKNOWN WILL BE AS DULL AS THE KNOWN; EVERYTHING WILL LACK INTEREST AND FLAVOR. ON THE RUINS OF KNOWLEDGE A SEPULCHRAL LETHARGY WILL MAKE US ALL INTO SPECTERS LUNAR HEROES OF INCURIOSITY. . . .

THEOLOGY
I AM IN A GOOD MOOD: GOD IS GOOD; I AM SULLEN: GOD IS WICKED; I AM INDIFFERENT: HE IS NEUTRAL. MY STATES CONFER UPON HIM CORRESPONDING ATTRIBUTES: WHEN I LOVE KNOWLEDGE HE IS OMNISCIENT AND WHEN I WORSHIP POWER OMNIPOTENT. WHEN THINGS SEEM TO ME TO EXIST HE EXISTS; WHEN THEY SEEM ILLUSORY HE EVAPORATES. A THOUSAND ARGUMENTS SUSTAIN HIM AND A THOUSAND DESTROY; IF MY ENTHUSIASMS ANIMATE HIM MY SULKS SMOTHER HIM. WE CANNOT FORM A MORE VARIABLE IMAGE: WE FEAR HIM AS A MONSTER AND CRUSH HIM LIKE A WORM; WE IDOLIZE HIM: HE IS BEING; REPEL HIM: HE IS NOTHINGNESS. WERE PRAYER TO SUPPLANT GRAVITY IT WOULD SCARCELY ASSURE HIS UNIVERSAL DURATION: HE WOULD STILL REMAIN AT THE MERCY OF OUR MOMENTS. HIS FATE HAS DECIDED THAT HE BE UNCHANGEABLE ONLY IN THE EYES OF THE NAIVE OR THE RETARDED. SCRUTINY REVEALS HIM: USELESS CAUSE MEANINGLESS ABSOLUTE PATRON OF DOLTS PASTIME OF SOLITARIES STRAW OR SPECTER ACCORDING TO WHETHER HE AMUSES OUR MIND OR HAUNTS OUR FEVERS.

    I AM GENEROUS: HE SWELLS WITH ATTRIBUTES; SOUR: HE IS HEAVY WITH ABSENCE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED HIM IN ALL HIS FORMS. HE RESISTS NEITHER CURIOSITY NOR INSPECTION: HIS MYSTERY HIS INFINITY DECLINES; HIS LUSTER DIMS; HIS PRESTIGE DIMINISHES. HE IS A WORN COSTUME WE MUST STRIP OFF; HOW STILL DRAPE OURSELVES IN A TATTERED GOD? HIS DEGRADATION HIS AGONY DRAG ON THROUGH THE AGES; BUT HE WILL NOT OUTLIVE US HE IS AGING: HIS LAST GASPS WILL PRECEDE OURS. ONCE HIS ATTRIBUTES ARE EXHAUSTED NO ONE WILL HAVE THE ENERGY TO FORGE HIM NEW ONES; AND THE CREATURE HAVING ASSUMED THEN REJECTED THEM WILL GO AND REJOIN IN NOTHINGNESS MS LOFTIEST INVENTION: HIS CREATOR.

THE METAPHYSICAL ANIMAL
IF WE COULD ELIMINATE EVERYTHING NEUROSIS HAS INSCRIBED IN THE MIND AND THE HEART ALL THE MORBID MARKS IT HAS LEFT THERE ALL THE IMPURE SHADOWS ACCOMPANYING IT! WHAT IS NOT SUPERFICIAL IS UNCLEAN. GOD: FRUIT OF THE ANXIETY OF OUR GUTS AND THE GURGLE OF OUR IDEAS. . . . ONLY ASPIRATION TO THE VOID SAVES US FROM THAT EXERCISE OF CORRUPTION WHICH IS THE ACT OF BELIEF. WHAT LIMPIDITY IN THE ART OF APPEARANCE IN THE INDIFFERENCE TO OUR ENDS AND OUR DISASTERS! TO THINK OF GOD TO SEEK HIM TO INVOKE OR TO ENDURE HIM—MOVEMENTS OF A DISORDERED BODY AND A DEFEATED MIND! THE NOBLY SUPERFICIAL AGES—THE RENAISSANCE THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY—SCORNED RELIGION DISMISSED ITS RUDIMENTARY FROLICS. BUT ALAS! THERE IS A PLEBEIAN MELANCHOLY IN US WHICH DARKENS OUR FERVORS AND OUR CONCEPTS. VAINLY WE DREAM OF A LACE UNIVERSE; GOD PRODUCT OF OUR DEPTHS OUR GANGRENE PROFANES THIS DREAM OF BEAUTY.

WE ARE METAPHYSICAL ANIMALS BY THE CORRUPTION WE HARBOR IN OURSELVES. HISTORY OF THOUGHT—PROCESSION OF OUR LAPSES; LIFE OF THE MIND—PARADE OF OUR VERTIGO. WHEN OUR HEALTH DECLINES THE UNIVERSE SUFFERS FOR IT AND MUST FOLLOW THE DESCENDING CURVE OF OUR VITALITY.

ENDLESSLY HARPING ON THE “WHY” AND THE “HOW"; TRACING THE CAUSE AND ALL CAUSES ON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT—DENOTES A DISORDER OF THE FUNCTIONS AND FACULTIES WHICH ENDS IN A “METAPHYSICAL DELIRIUM” —SENILITY OF THE ABYSS DOWNFALL OF ANGUISH ULTIMATE UGLINESS OF THE MYSTERIES. .. .

GENESIS OF MELANCHOLY
EVERY PROFOUND DISSATISFACTION IS OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE: OUR FAILURES DERIVE FROM OUR INCAPACITY TO CONCEIVE OF PARADISE AND TO ASPIRE TO IT AS OUR DISCOMFORTS FROM THE FRAGILITY OF OUR RELATIONS WITH THE ABSOLUTE. “I AM AN INCOMPLETE RELIGIOUS ANIMAL I SUFFER ALL ILLS DOUBLY"—AN ADAGE OF THE FALL WHICH MAN KEEPS REPEATING TO COMFORT HIMSELF. FAILING TO DO SO HE APPEALS TO ETHICS DECIDES TO FOLLOW AT THE RISK OF RIDICULE EDIFYING ADVICE: “RESOLVE TO BE MELANCHOLY NO LONGER” ETHICS REPLIES. AND MAN STRIVES TO ENTER THE UNIVERSE OF GOOD OF WELL-BEING OF HOPE. . . . BUT HIS EFFORTS ARE INEFFECTUAL AND AGAINST NATURE: MELANCHOLY HARKS BACK TO THE ROOT OF OUR RUIN . . . MELANCHOLY IS THE POETRY OF ORIGINAL SIN. . . .

DIVAGATIONS IN A MONASTERY
FOR THE UNBELIEVER INFATUATED WITH WASTE AND DISPERSION THERE IS NO SPECTACLE MORE DISTURBING THAN THESE RUMINANTS OF THE ABSOLUTE. . . . WHERE DO THEY FIND SUCH PERTINACITY IN THE UNVERIFIABLE SO MUCH ATTENTION IN THE VAGUE AND SO MUCH ARDOR TO APPREHEND IT AS WELL? I SHARE NEITHER THEIR CERTITUDES NOR THEIR SERENITY. THEY ARE HAPPY AND I BLAME THEM FOR BEING SO. IF AT LEAST THEY HATED THEMSELVES! BUT THEY PRIZE THEIR “SOUL” MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE; THIS FALSE EVALUATION IS THE SOURCE OF SACRIFICES AND RENUNCIATIONS OF AN IMPOSING ABSURDITY WHEREAS OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE NEITHER SEQUENCE NOR SYSTEM BEING AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE AND OUR MOODS THEY HAVE BUT ONE EXPERIENCE ALWAYS THE SAME OF A MONOTONY AND A PROFUNDITY WHICH ARE PROFOUNDLY DISHEARTENING. IT IS TRUE THAT GOD IS ITS OBJECT; BUT WHAT INTEREST CAN THEY STILL TAKE IN HIM? ALWAYS EQUAL TO HIMSELF INFINITELY OF THE SAME NATURE HE NEVER RENEWS HIMSELF; I COULD REFLECT UPON HIM IN PASSING BUT TO FILL THE HOURS WITH HIM! . . .

IT IS NOT YET DAYLIGHT. FROM MY CELL I HEAR VOICES AND THE AGE-OLD REFRAINS OFFERINGS TO A BANAL LATIN HEAVEN. EARLIER IN THE NIGHT STEPS HASTENED TOWARD THE CHAPEL. MATINS! EVEN IF GOD HIMSELF WERE TO ATTEND HIS OWN CELEBRATION I WOULD NOT GET OUT OF BED ON A NIGHT THIS COLD! BUT IN ANY CASE HE HAS TO EXIST OTHERWISE THESE SACRIFICES OF CREATURES OF FLESH SHAKING OFF THEIR SLOTH TO WORSHIP HIM WOULD BE OF SUCH INSANITY THAT REASON COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT. THE PROOFS OF THEOLOGY ARE FUTILE COMPARED TO THIS EXERTION WHICH PERPLEXES THE UNBELIEVER AND OBLIGES HIM TO ATTRIBUTE A MEANING AND A USE TO SUCH EFFORTS. UNLESS HE RESIGNS HIMSELF TO AN AESTHETIC PERSPECTIVE OF THESE DELIBERATE INSOMNIAS AND IN THE VANITY OF THESE VIGILS SEES MERELY THE MOST GIGANTIC ADVENTURE THE QUEST OF A BEAUTY OF NON-MEANING AND DREAD. . . . THE SPLENDOR OF A PRAYER ADDRESSED TO NO ONE! BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE: WHEN THIS PROBABLE CHANGES INTO CERTITUDE FELICITY IS NO LONGER A MERE WORD SO TRUE IS IT THAT THE ONLY ANSWER TO NOTHINGNESS LIES IN ILLUSION. HOW HAVE THEY ACQUIRED THIS ILLUSION LABELED ON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL GRACE? BY WHAT PRIVILEGE WERE THEY LED TO HOPE WHAT NO HOPE IN THIS WORLD LETS US GLIMPSE? BY WHAT RIGHT DO THEY INSTALL THEMSELVES IN AN ETERNITY WHICH EVERYTHING DENIES US? BY WHAT SUBTERFUGE DO THESE POSSESSORS—THE ONLY TRUE POSSESSORS I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED—ARROGATE THE MYSTERY TO THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO DELIGHT IN IT THEREBY? GOD BELONGS TO THEM; TO ATTEMPT TO SNEAK HIM AWAY WOULD BE FUTILE; THEY THEMSELVES KNOW NOTHING OF THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION. ONE FINE DAY . . . THEY BELIEVED. THIS ONE WAS CONVERTED BY A SIMPLE APPEAL: HE BELIEVED WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT; WHEN HE WAS HE ASSUMED THE HABIT. THAT ONE SUFFERED EVERY TORMENT: THEY CEASED BEFORE A SUDDEN LIGHT. ONE CANNOT WILL FAITH; LIKE A DISEASE IT INSINUATES ITSELF IN YOU OR STRIKES YOU DOWN; NO ONE CAN COMMAND IT; AND IT IS ABSURD TO LONG FOR IT IF YOU ARE NOT PREDESTINED TO IT. YOU ARE A BELIEVER OR YOU ARE NOT THE WAY YOU ARE CRAZY OR NORMAL I CAN NEITHER BELIEVE NOR WANT TO BELIEVE-—FAITH A FORM OF MADNESS TO WHICH I AM NOT AT ALL SUBJECT . . . THE UNBELIEVER’S POSITION IS QUITE AS IMPENETRABLE AS THE BELIEVER’S. I DEVOTE MYSELF TO THE PLEASURE OF BEING DISAPPOINTED: THIS IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE WORLD; ABOVE DOUBT I RANK ONLY THE DELIGHT WHICH DERIVES FROM IT. . . .

AND I ANSWER ALL THESE PINK OR CHLOROTIC MONKS: “YOU INSIST TO NO PURPOSE. I TOO HAVE GAZED UPON THE HEAVENS BUT I HAVE SEEN NOTHING THERE. GIVE UP TRYING TO CONVINCE ME: IF I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN ABLE TO FIND GOD BY DEDUCTION I HAVE NEVER FOUND HIM IN MY HEART; IF I FOUND HIM THERE I COULD NOT FOLLOW YOU ON YOUR PATH OR IN YOUR GRIMACES STILL LESS IN THOSE BALLETS WHICH ARE YOUR MASSES AND COMPLINES. NOTHING SURPASSES THE PLEASURES OF IDLENESS: IF THE END OF THE WORLD WERE TO COME I WOULD NOT LEAVE MY BED AT AN UNGODLY HOUR SO HOW WOULD I GO RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO IMMOLATE MY SLEEP ON THE ALTAR OF THE UNCERTAIN? EVEN IF GRACE BECLOUDED ME AND ECSTASIES MADE ME QUIVER UNCEASINGLY A FEW SARCASMS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME. OH NO YOU SEE I WOULD BE AFRAID TO SNEAR IN MY PRAYERS AND THEREBY TO DAMN MYSELF MUCH MORE BY FAITH THAN BY INCREDULITY. SPARE ME ANY FURTHER EFFORT; IN ANY CASE MY SHOULDERS ARE TOO WEARY TO PROP HEAVEN. . . .”

EXERCISE OF INSUBMISSION
HOW I DETEST LORD THE TURPITUDE OF YOUR WORKS AND THESE SYRUPY GHOSTS WHO BURN INCENSE TO YOU AND RESEMBLE YOU! HATING YOU I HAVE ESCAPED THE SUGAR MILLS OF YOUR KINGDOM THE TWADDLE OF YOUR PUPPETS. YOU ARE THE DAMPER OF OUR FLAMES AND OUR REBELLIONS THE FIRE HOSE OF OUR FEVERS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF OUR SENILITIES. EVEN BEFORE RELEGATING YOU TO A FORMULA I TRAMPLED YOUR ARCANA SCORNED YOUR TRICKS AND ALL THOSE ARTIFICES WHICH PRODUCE YOUR TOILETTE OF THE INEXPLICABLE. YOU HAVE GENEROUSLY ENDOWED ME WITH THE GALL YOUR PITY SPARED YOUR SLAVES. SINCE THERE IS NO REST BUT IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR NULLITY THE BRUTE FINDS SALVATION BY JUST HANDING HIMSELF OVER TO YOU OR YOUR COUNTERFEITS. I DON’T KNOW WHICH IS MORE PITIABLE YOUR ACOLYTES OR MYSELF: WE ALL DERIVE STRAIGHT FROM YOUR INCOMPETENCE: PITCH PATCH HODGEPODGE—SYLLABLES OF THE CREATION OF YOUR BLUNDERING. . . .

OF ALL THAT WAS ATTEMPTED THIS SIDE OF NOTHINGNESS IS ANYTHING MORE PATHETIC THAN THIS WORLD EXCEPT FOR THE IDEA WHICH CONCEIVED IT? WHEREVER SOMETHING BREATHES THERE IS ONE MORE INFIRMITY: NO PALPITATION WHICH FAILS TO CONFIRM THE DISADVANTAGE OF BEING; THE FLESH HORRIFIES ME: THESE MEN THESE WOMEN OFFAL THAT MOANS BY THE GRACE OF CERTAIN SPASMS; NO MORE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLANET: EACH MOMENT IS MERELY A VOTE IN THE URN OF MY DESPAIR.

WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER YOUR WORKS LEAVE OFF OR CONTINUE! YOUR SUBALTERNS CANNOT COMPLETE WHAT YOU VENTURED WITHOUT GENIUS. FROM THE BLINDNESS INTO WHICH YOU PLUNGED THEM THEY WILL EMERGE NONETHELESS BUT WILL THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TAKE REVENGE AND WILL YOU TO DEFEND YOURSELF? THIS RACE IS RUSTY AND YOU EVEN RUSTIER. TURNING TOWARD YOUR ENEMY I AWAIT THE DAY WHEN HE WILL PILFER YOUR SUN TO HANG IT IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE.

THE DECOR OF KNOWLEDGE
OUR TRUTHS ARE WORTH NO MORE THAN THOSE OF OUR ANCESTORS. HAVING SUBSTITUTED CONCEPTS FOR THEIR MYTHS AND SYMBOLS WE CONSIDER OURSELVES “ADVANCED"; BUT THESE MYTHS AND SYMBOLS EXPRESSED NO LESS THAN OUR CONCEPTS. THE TREE OF LIFE THE SERPENT EVE AND PARADISE SIGNIFY AS MUCH AS LIFE KNOWLEDGE TEMPTATION UNCONSCIOUSNESS. THE CONCRETE FIGURATIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL IN MYTHOLOGY GO AS FAR AS THE GOOD AND EVIL OF ETHICS. KNOWLEDGE—IF IT IS PROFOUND—NEVER CHANGES: ONLY ITS DECOR VARIES. LOVE CONTINUES WITHOUT VENUS WAR WITHOUT MARS AND IF THE GODS NO LONGER INTERVENE IN EVENTS THOSE EVENTS ARE NEITHER MORE EXPLICABLE NOR LESS DISCONCERTING: THE PARAPHERNALIA OF FORMULAS MERELY REPLACES THE POMP OF THE OLD LEGENDS WITHOUT THE CONSTANTS OF HUMAN LIFE BEING THEREBY MODIFIED SCIENCE APPREHENDING THEM NO MORE INTIMATELY THAN POETIC NARRATIVES.

MODERN COMPLACENCY IS LIMITLESS: WE SUPPOSE OURSELVES MORE ENLIGHTENED MORE PROFOUND THAN ALL THE CENTURIES BEHIND US FORGETTING THAT THE TEACHING OF A BUDDHA CONFRONTED THOUSANDS OF BEINGS WITH THE PROBLEM OF NOTHINGNESS A PROBLEM WE IMAGINE WE HAVE DISCOVERED BECAUSE WE HAVE CHANGED ITS TERMS AND INTRODUCED A TOUCH OF ERUDITION INTO IT. BUT WHAT WESTERN THINKER WOULD SURVIVE A COMPARISON WITH A BUDDHIST MONK? WE LOSE OURSELVES IN TEXTS AND TERMINOLOGIES: MEDITATION IS A DATUM UNKNOWN TO MODERN PHILOSOPHY. IF WE WANT TO KEEP SOME INTELLECTUAL DECENCY ENTHUSIASM FOR CIVILIZATION MUST BE BANISHED FROM OUR MIND AS WELL AS THE SUPERSTITION OF HISTORY. AS FOR THE GREAT PROBLEMS WE HAVE NO ADVANTAGE OVER OUR ANCESTORS OR OUR MORE RECENT PREDECESSORS: MEN HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN EVERYTHING AT LEAST IN WHAT CONCERNS THE ESSENTIAL; MODERN PHILOSOPHY ADDS NOTHING TO CHINESE HINDU OR GREEK PHILOSOPHY. MOREOVER THERE CANNOT BE A NEW PROBLEM DESPITE OUR NAÏVETE OR OUR INFATUATION WHICH WOULD LIKE TO PERSUADE US TO THE CONTRARY. IN THE PLAY OF IDEAS WHO EVER EQUALED A CHINESE OR A GREEK SOPHIST WHO WAS EVER BOLDER IN ABSTRACTION? ALL THE EXTREMITIES OF THOUGHT WERE REACHED FROM THE FIRST—AND IN ALL CIVILIZATIONS. SEDUCED BY THE DEMON OF THE UNPUBLISHED WE FORGET TOO QUICKLY THAT WE ARE THE EPIGONES OF THE FIRST PITHECANTHROPUS WHO BOTHERED TO REFLECT.

HEGEL IS CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MODERN OPTIMISM. HOW COULD HE HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGES ONLY ITS FORMS AND MODALITIES BUT NEVER PROGRESSES? BECOMING EXCLUDES AN ABSOLUTE FULFILLMENT A GOAL: THE TEMPORAL ADVENTURE UNFOLDS WITHOUT AN AIM EXTERNAL TO ITSELF AND WILL END WHEN ITS POSSIBILITIES OF MOVEMENT ARE EXHAUSTED. THE DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS VARIES WITH THE AGES SUCH CONSCIOUSNESS NOT BEING AGGRANDIZED BY THEIR SUCCESSION. WE ARE NOT MORE CONSCIOUS THAN THE GRECO-ROMAN WORLD THE RENAISSANCE OR THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY; EACH PERIOD IS PERFECT IN ITSELF—AND PERISHABLE. THERE ARE PRIVILEGED MOMENTS WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXASPERATED BUT THERE WAS NEVER AN ECLIPSE OF LUCIDITY SUCH THAT MAN WAS INCAPABLE OF CONFRONTING THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS HISTORY BEING NO MORE THAN A PERPETUAL CRISIS EVEN A BREAKDOWN OF NAÏVETE. NEGATIVE STATES—PRECISELY THOSE WHICH EXASPERATE CONSCIOUSNESS—ARE VARIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED; NONETHELESS THEY ARE PRESENT IN EVERY HISTORICAL PERIOD; BALANCED AND “HAPPY” THEY KNOW ENNUI—THE NATURAL NAME FOR HAPPINESS; UNBALANCED AND TUMULTUOUS THEY SUFFER DESPAIR AND THE RELIGIOUS CRISES WHICH DERIVE FROM IT. THE IDEA OF AN EARTHLY PARADISE WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE ELEMENTS INCOMPATIBLE WITH HISTORY WITH THE SPACE IN WHICH THE NEGATIVE STATES FLOURISH.

ALL MEANS AND METHODS OF KNOWING ARE VALID: REASONING INTUITION DISGUST ENTHUSIASM LAMENTATION. A VISION OF THE WORLD PROPPED ON CONCEPTS IS NO MORE LEGITIMATE THAN ANOTHER WHICH PROCEEDS FROM TEARS ARGUMENTS OR SIGHS—MODALITIES EQUALLY PROBING AND EQUALLY VAIN. I CONSTRUCT A FORM OF UNIVERSE; I BELIEVE IN IT AND IT IS THE UNIVERSE WHICH COLLAPSES NONETHELESS UNDER THE ASSAULT OF ANOTHER CERTITUDE OR ANOTHER DOUBT. THE MEREST ILLITERATE AND ARISTOTLE ARE EQUALLY IRREFUTABLE—AND FRAGILE. THE ABSOLUTE AND DECREPITUDE CHARACTERIZE THE WORK RIPENED FOR YEARS AND THE POEM DASHED OFF IN A MOMENT. IS THERE MORE TRUTH IN THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND THAN IN EPIPSYCHIDION? LIGHTNINGLIKE INSPIRATION AS WELL AS LABORIOUS INVESTIGATION OFFERS US DEFINITIVE RESULTS—AND RIDICULOUS ONES. TODAY I PREFER THIS WRITER TO THAT ONE; TOMORROW WILL COME THE TURN OF A WORK I DETESTED QUITE RECENTLY. THE CREATIONS OF THE MIND—AND THE PRINCIPLES WHICH PRESIDE OVER THEM—FOLLOW THE FATE OF OUR MOODS OF OUR AGE OF OUR FEVERS AND OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS. WE CALL INTO QUESTION EVERYTHING WE ONCE LOVED AND ARE ALWAYS RIGHT AND ALWAYS WRONG; FOR EVERYTHING IS VALID—AND NOTHING HAS ANY IMPORTANCE. I SMILE: A WORLD IS BORN; I FROWN: IT VANISHES AND ANOTHER APPEARS. NO OPINION NO SYSTEM NO BELIEF FAILS TO BE CORRECT AND AT THE SAME TIME ABSURD DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE ADHERE TO IT OR DETACH OURSELVES FROM IT.

WE DO NOT FIND MORE RIGOR IN PHILOSOPHY THAN IN POETRY NOR IN THE MIND THAN IN THE HEART; RIGOR EXISTS ONLY SO LONG AS WE IDENTIFY OURSELF WITH THE PRINCIPLE OR THING WHICH WE CONFRONT OR ENDURE; FROM OUTSIDE EVERYTHING IS ARBITRARY: REASONS AND SENTIMENTS. WHAT WE CALL TRUTH IS AN ERROR INSUFFICIENTLY EXPERIENCED NOT YET DRAINED BUT WHICH WILL SOON AGE A NEW ERROR AND WHICH WAITS TO COMPROMISE ITS NOVELTY. KNOWLEDGE BLOOMS AND WITHERS ALONG WITH OUR FEELINGS. AND IF WE ARE IN A POSITION TO SCRUTINIZE ALL TRUTHS IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED TOGETHER—AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE SAP IN US THAN IN THEM. HISTORY IS INCONCEIVABLE OUTSIDE OF WHAT DISAPPOINTS. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE DESIRE TO SUBMIT OURSELVES TO MELANCHOLY AND TO DIE OF IT. . . .

TRUE KNOWLEDGE COMES DOWN TO VIGILS IN THE DARKNESS: THE SUM OF OUR INSOMNIAS ALONE DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE ANIMALS AND FROM OUR KIND. WHAT RICH OR STRANGE IDEA WAS EVER THE WORK OF A SLEEPER? IS YOUR SLEEP SOUND? ARE YOUR DREAMS SWEET? YOU SWELL THE ANONYMOUS CROWD. DAYLIGHT IS HOSTILE TO THOUGHTS THE SUN BLOCKS THEM OUT; THEY FLOURISH ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. . . . CONCLUSION OF NOCTURNAL KNOWLEDGE: EVERY MAN WHO ARRIVES AT A REASSURING CONCLUSION ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL GIVES EVIDENCE OF IMBECILITY OR FALSE CHARITY. WHO EVER FOUND A SINGLE JOYOUS TRUTH WHICH WAS VALID? WHO SAVED THE HONOR OF THE INTELLECT WITH DAYLIGHT UTTERANCES? HAPPY THE MAN WHO CAN SAY TO HIMSELF: “KNOWLEDGE TURNED SOUR ON ME.”

HISTORY IS IRONY ON THE MOVE THE MIND’S JEER DOWN THROUGH MEN AND EVENTS. TODAY THIS BELIEF TRIUMPHS; TOMORROW VANQUISHED IT WILL BE DISMISSED AND REPLACED: THOSE WHO ACCEPTED IT WILL FOLLOW IT IN ITS DEFEAT THEN COMES ANOTHER GENERATION: THE OLD BELIEF IS REVIVED; ITS DEMOLISHED MONUMENTS ARE RECONSTRUCTED . . . UNTIL THEY PERISH YET AGAIN. NO IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLE RULES THE FAVORS AND SEVERITIES OF FATE: THEIR SUCCESSION PARTICIPATES IN THE HUGE FARCE OF THE MIND WHICH IDENTIFIES IN ITS PLAY IMPOSTORS AND ENTHUSIASTS ARDORS AND DEVICES. CONSIDER THE POLEMICS OF EACH AGE: THEY SEEM NEITHER MOTIVATED NOR NECESSARY. YET THEY WERE THE VERY LIFE OF THAT AGE CALVINISM QUIETISM PORT-ROYAL THE ENCYCLOPEDIA THE REVOLUTION POSITIVISM ETC. . . . WHAT A SERIES OF ABSURDITIES . . . WHICH/TAI TO BE WHAT A FUTILE AND YET FATAL EXPENSE! FROM THE ECUMENICAL COUNCILS TO THE CONTROVERSIES OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS ORTHODOXIES AND HERESIES HAVE ASSAILED THE CURIOSITY OF MANKIND WITH THEIR IRRESISTIBLE NON-MEANING. UNDER VARIOUS DISGUISES THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PRO AND CON WHETHER APROPOS OF HEAVEN OR THE BORDELLO. THOUSANDS OF MEN WILL SUFFER FOR SUBTLETIES RELATING TO THE VIRGIN AND THE SON; THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WILL TORMENT THEMSELVES FOR DOGMAS LESS GRATUITOUS BUT QUITE AS IMPROBABLE. ALL TRUTHS CONSTITUTE SECTS WHICH END BY ENDURING THE DESTINY OF A PORT-ROYAL BY BEING PERSECUTED AND DESTROYED; THEN THEIR RUINS BELOVED NOW AND EMBELLISHED WITH THE HALO OF THE INIQUITY INFLICTED UPON THEM WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A PILGRIMAGE-SITE. . . .

IT IS NO LESS UNREASONABLE TO GRANT MORE INTEREST TO THE ARGUMENTS AROUND DEMOCRACY AND ITS FORMS THAN TO THOSE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE MIDDLE AGES AROUND NOMINALISM AND REALISM: EACH PERIOD IS INTOXICATED BY AN ABSOLUTE MINOR AND TIRESOME BUT IN APPEARANCE UNIQUE; WE CANNOT AVOID BEING CONTEMPORARIES OF A FAITH OF A SYSTEM OF AN IDEOLOGY CANNOT AVOID BEING IN SHORT OF OUR TIME. IN ORDER TO BE EMANCIPATED FROM THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE THE COLDNESS OF A GOD OF SCORN. . . .

THAT HISTORY HAS NO MEANING IS WHAT SHOULD DELIGHT OUR HEARTS. SHOULD WE BE TORMENTING OURSELVES FOR A HAPPY SOLUTION TO PROCESS FOR A FINAL FESTIVAL PAID FOR BY NOTHING BUT OUR SWEAT OUR DISASTERS? FOR FUTURE IDIOTS EXULTING OVER OUR LABORS FROLICKING ON OUR ASHES? THE VISION OF A PARADISIAC CONCLUSION TRANSCENDS IN ITS ABSURDITY THE WORST DIVAGATIONS OF HOPE. ALL WE CAN OFFER IN EXCUSE FOR TIME IS THAT IN IT WE FIND SOME MOMENTS MORE PROFITABLE THAN OTHERS ACCIDENTS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE IN AN INTOLERABLE MONOTONY OF PERPLEXITIES. THE UNIVERSE BEGINS AND ENDS WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL WHETHER HE BE SHAKESPEARE OR HODGE; FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES HIS MERIT OR HIS NULLITY IN THE ABSOLUTE. . . .

BY WHAT ARTIFICE DID WHAT SEEMS TO BE ESCAPE THE CONTROL OF WHAT IS NOT? A MOMENT OF INATTENTION OF WEAKNESS AT THE HEART OF NOTHINGNESS: THE GRABS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT; A GAP IN ITS VIGILANCE: AND HERE WE ARE. AND JUST AS LIFE SUPPLANTED NOTHINGNESS LIFE IN ITS TURN WAS SUPPLANTED BY HISTORY: EXISTENCE THEREBY COMMITTED ITSELF TO A CYCLE OF HERESIES WHICH SAPPED THE ORTHODOXY OF THE VOID.

ABDICATIONS
THE ROPE—UNDERSIDE OF AN OBSESSION—EPITAPH—SECULARIZATION OF TEARS—FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WILL—THEORY OF GOODNESS—MAKING ALLOWANCES—WONDERS OF VICE—THE CORRUPTER—THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAVES—DISCIPLINE OF ATONY—SUPREME EROSION—AT THE OBSEQUIES OF DESIRE—IRREFUTABLE DISAPPOINTMENT—IN THE SECRET OF MORALISTS—MONASTIC FANTASY—IN HONOR OF MADNESS—MY HEROES—THE SIMPLE-MINDED—POVERTY: MENTAL STIMULANT—INVOCATION TO INSOMNIA—PROFILE OF THE WICKED MAN—VIEWS ON TOLERANCE—SARTORIAL PHILOSOPHY—AMONG THE DREGS—ON AN ENTREPRENEUR OF IDEAS—TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT—FLAYED ALIVE—INCOMPATIBILITIES—RESTORATION OF A CULT—WE TROGLODYTES— PHYSIOGNOMY OF A FAILURE—PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN—QUOUSQUE EADEM?

THE RAPE
I NO LONGER REMEMBER HOW I HAPPENED TO BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF THIS CONFIDENCE: “POSSESSING NOT PROPERTY PROJECTS OR EVEN MEMORIES I HAVE GIVEN OVER FUTURE AND PHILOSOPHY ALIKE OWNING MERELY A COT ON WHICH TO UNLEARN THE SUN AND SIGHS. I REMAIN STRETCHED OUT THERE AND SPIN OUT THE HOURS; AROUND ME UTENSILS OBJECTS WHICH SUGGEST SUICIDE EVERY ONE. THE NAIL WHISPERS: STICK ME THROUGH YOUR HEART THE TRICKLE OF BLOOD NEED NOT ALARM YOU. THE KNIFE INSINUATES: MY BLADE IS INFALLIBLE; ONE SECOND’S DECISION AND YOU HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER MISERY AND SHAME. THE WINDOW OPENS OF ITS OWN ACCORD CREAKING IN THE SILENCE: YOU SHARE THE CITY’S HEIGHTS WITH THE POOR; FLING YOURSELF OUT MY OVERTURE IS A GENEROUS ONE; IN THE WINK OF AN EYE YOU WILL LAND ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THE MEANING—OR THE MEANINGLESSNESS—OF LIFE IN YOUR GRASP. AND A ROPE COILS AS THOUGH AROUND SOME IDEAL NECK BORROWING THE TONE OF A SUPPLIANT POWER: I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER I HAVE WATCHED YOUR TERRORS YOUR STRUGGLES AND YOUR RAGES I HAVE SEEN YOUR RUMPLED SHEETS THE PILLOW WHERE YOUR FURY GNAWED AS I HAVE HEARD THE SWEARWORDS WITH WHICH YOU GRATIFIED THE GODS. CHARITABLE I SYMPATHIZE AND OFFER MY SERVICES. FOR YOU WERE BORN TO HANG YOURSELF LIKE ALL THOSE WHO DISDAIN AN ANSWER TO THEIR DOUBTS OR AN ESCAPE TO THEIR DESPAIR.”

UNDERSIDE OF AN OBSESSION
THE NOTION OF NOTHINGNESS IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF LABORING HUMANITY: THOSE WHO TOIL HAVE NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO WEIGH THEIR DUST; THEY RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THE DIFFICULTIES OR THE DOLTISHNESS OF FATE; THEY HOPE: HOPE IS A SLAVE’S VIRTUE.

IT IS THE VAIN THE FATUOUS AND THE COQUETTISH WHO DREADING GRAY HAIR WRINKLES AND THE DEATH RATTLE FILL THEIR DAILY VACANCY WITH THE IMAGE OF THEIR OWN CARRION: THEY CHERISH AND DESPAIR OF THEMSELVES; THEIR THOUGHTS FLUTTER BETWEEN THE MIRROR AND THE GRAVEYARD AND DISCOVER IN THE JEOPARDIZED FEATURES OF THEIR FACES TRUTHS AS SERIOUS AS THOSE OF RELIGION. EVERY METAPHYSIC BEGINS WITH AN ANGUISH OF THE BODY WHICH THEN BECOMES UNIVERSAL; SO THAT THOSE OBSESSED BY FRIVOLITY PREFIGURE AUTHENTICALLY TORMENTED MINDS. THE SUPERFICIAL IDLER HAUNTED BY THE SPECTER OF AGE IS CLOSER TO PASCAL BOSSUET OR CHATEAUBRIAND THAN A SAVANT QUITE UNCONCERNED WITH HIMSELF. A TOUCH OF GENIUS IN VANITY: YOU HAVE THE GREAT PROUD MAN WHO FINDS DEATH HARD TO DEAL WITH—WHO TAKES IT AS A PERSONAL OFFENSE. BUDDHA HIMSELF SUPERIOR TO ALL THE SAGES WAS MERELY FATUOUS ON A DIVINE SCALE. HE DISCOVERED DEATH HIS DEATH AND WOUNDED RENOUNCED EVERYTHING AND IMPOSED HIS RENUNCIATION ON OTHERS. THUS THE MOST TERRIBLE AND THE MOST FUTILE SUFFERINGS ARE BEGOTTEN BY THAT CRUSHED PRIDE WHICH IN ORDER TO FACE UP TO NOTHINGNESS TRANSFORMS IT OUT OF REVENGE INTO LAW.

EPITAPH
“HE HAD THE PRIDE NEVER TO COMMAND OR TO PRESCRIBE ANYTHING ANYONE. WITHOUT SUBALTERNS WITHOUT MASTERS HE NEITHER GAVE NOR RECEIVED ORDERS. EXCLUDED FROM THE EMPIRE OF LAWS AND SOMEHOW ANTERIOR TO GOOD AND EVIL HE NEVER MADE A LIVING SOUL SUFFER. THE NAMES OF THINGS FADED FROM HIS MEMORY; HE LOOKED WITHOUT SEEING LISTENED WITHOUT HEARING; SCENTS AND SAVORS VANISHED AT THE APPROACH OF HIS NOSTRILS HIS PALATE. HIS SENSES AND HIS DESIRES WERE HIS ONLY SLAVES: HENCE THEY FELT DESIRED NOTHING. HE FORGOT HAPPINESS AND MISERY THIRST AND FEAR; AND IF HE HAPPENED TO RECALL THEM HE SCORNED TO NAME THEM AND THEREBY TO SINK TO HOPE OR REGRET. THE MEREST GESTURE COST HIM MORE EFFORTS THAN IT WOULD COST OTHERS TO ESTABLISH OR OVERTHROW A KINGDOM. BORN WEARY OF BEING BORN HE CHOSE TO BE A SHADE; WHEN THEN DID HE LIVE AND BY THE TRANSGRESSION OF WHAT BIRTH? AND IF LIVING HE WORE HIS SHROUD BY WHAT MIRACLE DID HE MANAGE TO DIE?”

SECULARIZATION OF TEARS
ONLY SINCE BEETHOVEN HAS MUSIC ADDRESSED ITSELF TO MEN: BEFORE HIM IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH GOD. BACH AND THE GREAT ITALIANS KNEW NOTHING OF THIS DESCENT TOWARD THE HUMAN THIS FALSE TITANISM WHICH HAS DILUTED SINCE THE DEAF MAN THE PUREST ART. THE TORSION OF THE WILL REPLACED THE SUAVITIES; THE CONTRADICTION OF THE FEELINGS THE NAIVE FLIGHT; FRENZY THE DISCIPLINED SIGH: HEAVEN HAVING VANISHED FROM MUSIC MAN WAS INSTALLED THERE. WHERE SIN HAD ONCE SPREAD IN GENTLE TEARS IT NOW DISPLAYED ITSELF SO THAT DECLAMATION OVERTOOK PRAYER AND THE ROMANTICISM OF THE FALL TRIUMPHED OVER THE HARMONIOUS DREAM OF DEPOSITION. . . .

BACH: LANGUOR OF COSMOGONY; A SCALE OF TEARS UPON WHICH OUR DESIRES FOR GOD ASCEND; ARCHITECTURE OF OUR FRAGILITIES POSITIVE DISSOLUTION—THE HIGHEST OF ALL—OF OUR WILL; CELESTIAL RUIN IN HOPE; THE ONE MODE OF DESTROYING OURSELVES WITHOUT DISASTER AND OF DISAPPEARING WITHOUT DYING. . . .

IS IT TOO LATE TO RELEARN SUCH DYING OUT? OR MUST WE GO ON FALTERING WITHOUT BENEFIT OF THE ORGAN’S CHORDS?

FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WILL
“DO YOU KNOW THAT FURNACE OF THE WILL IN WHICH NOTHING RESISTS YOUR DESIRES WHERE FATALITY AND GRAVITATION LOSE THEIR EMPIRE AND VANISH BEFORE THE MAGIC OF YOUR POWER? CERTAIN THAT YOUR GAZE WOULD REVIVE THE DEAD THAT YOUR HAND LAID UPON MATTER WOULD BRING IT TO LIFE THAT STONES WOULD SHUDDER AT YOUR TOUCH THAT EVERY GRAVEYARD WOULD BLOSSOM IN A SMILE OF IMMORTALITY—YOU TELL YOURSELF: 'FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE NOTHING BUT AN ETERNAL SPRING A DANCE OF WONDERS AND THE END OF ALL SLEEP. I HAVE BROUGHT ANOTHER FIRE: THE GODS PALE AND THE CREATURES REJOICE; CONSTERNATION HAS SEIZED UPON THE VAULTS AND THE DIN HAS DESCENDED INTO THE VERY TOMBS.'

“. . . AND THE AMATEUR OF PAROXYSMS WINDED FALLS SILENT ONLY TO RESUME WITH THE ACCENT OF QUIETISM WORDS OF ABANDON:

“ 'HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED THAT SOMNOLENCE WHICH IS TRANSMITTED TO THINGS THAT SLACKNESS WHICH WEAKENS THE SAP AND SUGGESTS A TRIUMPHANT—AND ETERNAL—AUTUMN? EVEN AS I PASS ALL HOPES DROWSE FLOWERS FADE THE INSTINCTS WITHER: EVERYTHING STOPS WILLING EVERYTHING REPENTS OF HAVING WILLED. AND EACH BEING WHISPERS TO ME: “LET SOMEONE ELSE HAVE LIVED MY LIFE GOD OR GARTER SNAKE. I SIGH FOR A WILL TO INACTION AN UNRELEASED INFINITY AN ECSTATIC ATONY OF THE ELEMENTS A HIBERNATION IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WHICH WOULD BENUMB EVERYTHING FROM HOG TO DRAGONFLY. . . .”’”

THEORY OF GOODNESS
SINCE FOR YOU THERE IS NO ULTIMATE CRITERION NOR IRREVOCABLE PRINCIPLE AND NO GOD WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM COMMITTING ANY AND EVERY CRIME?

“I FIND IN MYSELF AS MUCH EVIL AS IN ANYONE BUT DETESTING ACTION—MOTHER OF ALL THE VICES—1 AM THE CAUSE OF NO ONE’S SUFFERING. HARMLESS WITHOUT GREED AND WITHOUT ENOUGH ENERGY OR INDECENCY TO AFFRONT OTHERS I LEAVE THE WORLD AS ! FOUND IT. TO TAKE REVENGE PRESUPPOSES A CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND A SYSTEMATIC MIND A COSTLY CONTINUITY WHEREAS THE INDIFFERENCE OF FORGIVENESS AND CONTEMPT RENDERS THE HOURS PLEASANTLY EMPTY. ALL ETHICS REPRESENT A DANGER FOR GOODNESS; ONLY NEGLIGENCE RESCUES IT. HAVING CHOSEN THE PHLEGM OF THE IMBECILE AND THE APATHY OF THE ANGEL I HAVE EXCLUDED MYSELF FROM ACTIONS AND SINCE GOODNESS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH LIFE I HAVE DECOMPOSED MYSELF IN ORDER TO BE GOOD.”

MAKING ALLOWANCES
IT REQUIRES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS TO DEVOTE ONESELF UNRESERVEDLY TO ANYTHING. BELIEVERS LOVERS DISCIPLES PERCEIVE ONLY ONE FACE OF THEIR DEITIES THEIR IDOLS THEIR MASTERS. THE WORSHIPPER REMAINS INELUCTABLY NAIVE. IS THERE A PURE FEELING WHICH FAILS TO BETRAY THE MIXTURE OF GRACE AND IMBECILITY A BLISSFUL ADMIRATION WITHOUT AN ECLIPSE OF THE INTELLIGENCE? THE MAN WHO GLIMPSES SIMULTANEOUSLY ALL THE ASPECTS OF A BEING OR A THING REMAINS FOREVER UNDECIDED BETWEEN IMPULSE AND STUPOR. DISSECT ANY BELIEF: WHAT POMP OF THE HEART—AND HOW MUCH TURPITUDE UNDERNEATH! INFINITY DREAMED OF IN THE GUTTER RETAINS INEFFACEABLE ITS IMPRINT ITS STENCH. THERE IS A NOTARY IN EVERY SAINT A GROCER IN EVERY HERO A CONCIERGE INSIDE THE MARTYR. THE DEPTH OF SIGHS CONCEALS A GRIMACE; SACRIFICES AND DEVOTIONS ARE MINGLED WITH THE VAPORS OF THE EARTHLY BORDELLO. CONSIDER LOVE: IS THERE A NOBLER OUTPOURING A RAPTURE LESS SUSPECT? ITS SHUDDERS RIVAL MUSIC COMPETE WITH THE TEARS OF SOLITUDE AND OF ECSTASY: SUBLIME BUT A SUBLIMITY INSEPARABLE FROM THE URINARY TRACT: TRANSPORTS BORDERING UPON EXCRETION A HEAVEN OF THE GLANDS SUDDEN SANCTITY OF THE ORIFICES. . . . IT TAKES NO MORE THAN A MOMENT OF ATTENTION FOR THIS INTOXICATION SHAKEN TO CAST YOU BACK INTO THE ORDURES OF PHYSIOLOGY OR A MOMENT OF FATIGUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SO MUCH ARDOR PRODUCES ONLY A VARIETY OF MUCOUS. THE WAKING STATE IN OUR RAVISHMENTS ALTERS THEIR FLAVOR AND TRANSFORMS THEIR VICTIM INTO A VISIONARY TRAMPLING INEFFABLE PRETEXTS. WE CANNOT LOVE AND KNOW AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT LOVE SUFFERING AND EXPIRING UNDER THE MIND’S GAZE. SEARCH YOUR ADMIRATIONS SCRUTINIZE THE BENEFICIARIES OF YOUR WORSHIP AND THE PROFITEERS OF YOUR ABANDONS: UNDER THEIR MOST DISINTERESTED THOUGHTS YOU WILL DISCOVER SELF-LOVE THE SPUR OF FAME THE THIRST FOR DOMINATION AND POWER. ALL THINKERS ARE ACTION’S EUNUCHS WHO TAKE REVENGE FOR THEIR FAILURE BY THE INTERMEDIARY OF CONCEPTS. BORN THIS SIDE OF THE DEED THEY EXALT OR DECRY IT DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ASPIRE TO HUMANITY’S GRATITUDE OR THAT OTHER FORM OF FAME: ITS HATRED; THEY UNDULY ERECT THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES THEIR OWN MISERIES TO THE RANK OF LAWS THEIR FUTILITY TO THE LEVEL OF A PRINCIPLE. THOUGHT IS AS MUCH OF A LIE AS LOVE OR FAITH. FOR THE TRUTHS ARE FRAUDS AND THE PASSIONS ODORS; AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO CHOICE EXCEPT THE ONE BETWEEN WHAT LIES AND WHAT STINKS.

WONDERS OF VICE
WHEREAS A THINKER REQUIRES—TO DISSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM THE WORLD—AN ENORMOUS LABOR OF INTERROGATIONS THE PRIVILEGE OF A FLAW CONFERS FROM THE START A SINGULAR DESTINY. VICE—BESTOWER OF SOLITUDE—OFFERS THE MAN MARKED OUT BY IT THE EXCELLENCE OF A SEPARATE CONDITION. CONSIDER THE INVERT: HE INSPIRES TWO CONTRADICTORY SENTIMENTS: DISGUST AND ADMIRATION; HIS “FAILURE” MAKES HIM AT ONCE INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR TO THE OTHERS; HE DOES NOT ACCEPT HIMSELF CONSTANTLY JUSTIFIES HIMSELF INVENTS REASONS TORN BETWEEN SHAME AND PRIDE; YET—ENTHUSIASTS OF THE FATUITIES OF PROCREATION—WE GO WITH THE HERD. WOE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NO SEXUAL SECRETS! HOW COULD WE DIVINE THE FETID ADVANTAGES OF THE ABERRATIONS? SHALL WE REMAIN FOREVER THE PROGENITURE OF NATURE VICTIMS OF HER LAWS NOTHING BUT HUMAN TREES?

THE INDIVIDUAL’S DEFICIENCIES DETERMINE A CIVILIZATION’S FLEXIBILITY AND SUBTLETY. RARE SENSATIONS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE MIND AND ITS VITALITY: THE DISTRACTED INSTINCT IS LOCATED AT THE ANTIPODES OF BARBARISM. CONSEQUENTLY AN IMPOTENT MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THAN A BRUTE WITH UNDISTURBED REFLEXES AND REALIZES BETTER THAN ANYONE THE ESSENCE OF MANKIND THAT DESERTER FROM ZOOLOGY AND IS ENRICHED BY ALL ITS INADEQUACIES ALL ITS IMPOSSIBILITIES. SUPPRESS VICES AND FLAWS TAKE AWAY CARNAL DISORDERS AND YOU WILL MEET NO MORE SOULS; FOR WHAT WE CALL BY THAT NAME IS MERELY A PRODUCT OF INNER SCANDALS A DESIGNATION OF MYSTERIOUS SHAMES AN IDEALIZATION OF ABJECTION. . . .

IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS NAÏVETE THE THINKER ENVIES THE POSSIBILITIES OF KNOWLEDGE OPEN TO WHATEVER IS CONTRA NATURAM HE BELIEVES—NOT WITHOUT REPULSION—IN THE PRIVILEGES OF “MONSTERS". . . . VICE BEING A SUFFERING AND THE SOLE FORM OF CELEBRITY WORTH THE TROUBLE THE “VICIOUS” MAN HAS TO BE DEEPER THAN THE COMMON RUN SINCE UNSPEAKABLY SEPARATED FROM THE REST; HE BEGINS WHERE THE OTHERS LEAVE OFF. . . .

A NATURAL PLEASURE TAKEN IN WHAT IS OBVIOUS CANCELS ITSELF OUT DESTROYS ITSELF IN ITS OWN MEANS EXPIRES IN ITS ACTUALITY WHEREAS AN UNWONTED SENSATION IS A THOUGHT OUT SENSATION A REFLECTION IN THE REFLEXES. VICE ATTAINS THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS—WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIARY OF PHILOSOPHY; BUT THE THINKER REQUIRES A WHOLE LIFETIME TO ARRIVE AT THIS AFFECTIVE LUCIDITY BY WHICH THE PERVERT BEGINS. YET THEY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR PROPENSITY TO WREST THEMSELVES FROM THE OTHERS THOUGH THE ONE STRIVES TO DO SO BY MEDITATION WHILE THE OTHER MERELY FOLLOWS THE WONDERS OF HIS INCLINATION.

THE CORRUPTER
“WHERE HAVE THE HOURS GONE? THE MEMORY OF A GESTURE THE MARK OF A PASSION THE LUSTER OF A RISK A LOVELY FUGITIVE MADNESS—NOTHING OF ALL THAT IN YOUR PAST; NO DELIRIUM BEARS YOUR NAME NO VICE HONORS YOU. YOU HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH WITHOUT A TRACE; BUT WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM THEN?

“I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SOW DOUBT INTO THE ENTRAILS OF THE GLOBE TO IMBUE ITS SUBSTANCE WITH DOUBT TO ENTHRONE DOUBT WHERE THE MIND NEVER PENETRATED AND BEFORE REACHING THE MARROW OF MANKIND TO SHAKE THE CALM OF STONES TO INTRODUCE THERE THE INSECURITY AND THE ANGUISH OF THE HEART. ARCHITECT I WOULD HAVE BUILT A TEMPLE TO RUIN; PREACHER REVEALED THE FARCE OF PRAYER; KING HOISTED THE FLAG OF REBELLION. AS MEN CHERISH A SECRET CRAVING TO REPUDIATE THEMSELVES I SHOULD HAVE PROVOKED SELF-BETRAYAL EVERYWHERE PLUNGED INNOCENCE INTO STUPOR MULTIPLIED DISLOYALTIES KEPT THE MULTITUDE FROM WALLOWING IN THE COMPOST HEAP OF CERTITUDES.”

THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAVES
THEOLOGY ETHICS HISTORY AND EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE TEACH US THAT TO ACHIEVE EQUILIBRIUM THERE IS NOT AN INFINITY OF SECRETS; THERE IS ONLY ONE: SUBMIT “ACCEPT A YOKE” THESE DISCIPLINES ALL REPEAT AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY; BE SOMETHING AND YOU SHALL BE RELEASED FROM YOUR LABORS.” INDEED ALL IS TASK HERE ON EARTH: PROFESSIONALS OF TIME FUNCTIONARIES OF RESPIRATION DIGNITARIES OF HOPE A JOB IS WAITING FOR US BEFORE WE ARE BORN: OUR CAREERS ARE PREPARED IN THE WOMBS OF OUR MOTHERS. MEMBERS OF AN OFFICIAL UNIVERSE WE HAVE TO OCCUPY A PLACE THERE BY THE MECHANISM OF A RIGID FATE WHICH IS LEFT VACANT ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE MAD; THEY AT LEAST ARE NOT CONSTRAINED TO HAVE A BELIEF TO ADHERE TO AN INSTITUTION TO SUSTAIN AN IDEA TO PURSUE AN UNDERTAKING. SINCE SOCIETY WAS CONSTITUTED THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM IT WERE PERSECUTED OR MOCKED. YOU ARE FORGIVEN EVERYTHING PROVIDED YOU HAVE A TRADE A SUBTITLE TO YOUR NAME A SEAL ON YOUR NOTHINGNESS. NO ONE HAS THE AUDACITY TO EXCLAIM: “I DON’T WANT TO DO ANYTHING!” —WE ARE MORE INDULGENT WITH A MURDERER THAN WITH A MIND EMANCIPATED FROM ACTIONS. TO MULTIPLY THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUBMISSION TO ABDICATE HIS FREEDOM TO KILL THE VAGABOND IN HIMSELF—THUS HAS MAN REFINED HIS SLAVERY AND ENFEOFFED HIMSELF TO PHANTOMS. EVEN HIS SCORNS AND HIS REBELLIONS HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED ONLY SO HE CAN BE DOMINATED BY THEM SERF THAT HE IS OF HIS ATTITUDES HIS GESTURES AND HIS MOODS. HAVING LEFT THE CAVES HE HAS KEPT THEIR SUPERSTITION; HE WAS THEIR PRISONER AND HAS BECOME THEIR ARCHITECT. HE PERPETUATES MS PRIMAL CONDITION WITH MORE INVENTION AND MORE SUBTLETY BUT AT BOTTOM DILATING OR DIMINISHING HIS CARICATURE HE PLAGIARIZES HIMSELF BRAZENLY ENOUGH. A CHARLATAN SHORT OF TRICKS HIS CONTORTIONS HIS GRIMACES STILL DECEIVE . . .

DISCIPLINE OF ATONY
LIKE WAX IN THE SUN I DISSOLVE BY DAY AND SOLIDIFY AT NIGHT AN ALTERNATION WHICH DECOMPOSES ME AND RESTORES ME TO MYSELF A METAMORPHOSIS IN INERTIA AND SLOTH. . . . WAS IT HERE THAT ALL I HAVE READ AND LEARNED WAS TO END WAS THIS THE GOAL OF MY VIGILS? IDLENESS HAS BLUNTED MY ENTHUSIASMS SLACKENED MY APPETITES ENERVATED MY FURY. THE MAN WHO FAILS TO LET HIMSELF GO SEEMS TO ME A MONSTER: I USE UP MY STRENGTH IN THE APPRENTICESHIP TO ABANDON AND TRAIN MYSELF IN LEISURE CONFRONTING MY WHIMS WITH THE PARAGRAPHS OF AN ART OF PUTRESCENCE.

EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WHO WILL . . . MASQUERADE OF STEPS HURRYING TOWARD MEAN OR MYSTERIOUS GOALS; CONFLICTING WILLS; EVERYONE WILLS; THE MOB WILLS; THOUSANDS BENT ON SOMETHING ANYTHING. . . . I CANNOT FOLLOW STILL LESS DEFY THEM; I STOP STUPEFIED: WHAT MARVEL INSPIRED THEM WITH SUCH ENERGY? HALLUCINATING MOBILITY: IN SO LITTLE FLESH SO MUCH VIGOR AND HYSTERIA! THESE BACTERIA THAT NO SCRUPLE CAN CALM THAT NO WISDOM CAN SOOTHE THAT NO GALL CAN DISCONCERT . . . THEY BRAVE DANGERS WITH MORE APLOMB THAN ANY HERO: UNCONSCIOUS APOSTLES OF THE EFFECTIVE THESE SAINTS OF THE IMMEDIATE . . . GODS IN THE CARNIVALS OF TIME. . . .

I TURN AWAY AND STEP OFF THE SIDEWALKS OF THE WORLD. . . . YET THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I ADMIRED THE CONQUERORS AND THE BEES WHEN I VERY NEARLY HOPED; BUT NOW MOVEMENT MADDENS ME AND ENERGY MERELY GRIEVES. THERE IS MORE WISDOM IN LETTING YOURSELF BE CARRIED BY THE WAVES THAN IN STRUGGLING AGAINST THEM. POSTHUMOUS TO MYSELF I REMEMBER TIME AS A KIND OF CHILD’S PLAY OR A LAPSE OF TASTE. WITHOUT DESIRES WITHOUT THE HOURS IN WHICH TO MAKE THEM BLOOM I HAVE ONLY THE ASSURANCE OF HAVING ALWAYS OUTLIVED MYSELF A FETUS DEVOURED BY AN OMNISCIENT IDIOCY EVEN BEFORE HIS EYELIDS OPENED AND STILLBORN OF LUCIDITY. . . .

SUPREME EROSION
THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH RIVALS THE MOST SORDID TROLL SOMETHING DIRTY WORN DEFEATED AND WHICH PROVOKES AND AT THE SAME TIME DISCONCERTS FURY-—A PEAK OF EXASPERATION AND AN ARTICLE OF EVERY MOMENT: THE WORD ANY WORD AND MORE PRECISELY THE ONE WE MAKE USE OF. I SAY: TREE HOUSE ME MAGNIFICENT STUPID; I COULD SAY ANYTHING AND I DREAM OF A MURDERER OF ALL NOUNS AND ALL ADJECTIVES OF ALL THESE HONORABLE ERUCTATIONS. SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE DEAD AND NO ONE WANTS TO BURY THEM. OUT OF COWARDICE WE STILL CONSIDER THEM TO BE ALIVE AND GO ON ENDURING THEIR SMELL WITHOUT HOLDING OUR NOSES. YET THEY ARE NOT NO LONGER EXPRESS ANYTHING. WHEN WE THINK OF ALL THE MOUTHS THEY PASS THROUGH ALL THE BREATHS THEY CORRUPT ALL THE OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY WERE OFFERED CAN WE STILL EMPLOY A SINGLE ONE WITHOUT BEING POLLUTED?

THEY ARE TOSSED TO US PRE-CHEWED: YET WE WOULD NOT DREAM OF SWALLOWING FOOD ALREADY MASTICATED BY OTHERS: THE MATERIAL ACTION WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE USE OF WORDS TURNS OUR STOMACH; YET ALL IT TAKES IS A MOMENT’S IRRITATION TO REALIZE UNDER ANY WORD AN AFTERTASTE OF SOMEONE ELSE’S SALIVA.

TO REFRESH LANGUAGE HUMANITY WOULD HAVE TO STOP TALKING: IT WOULD RESORT PROFITABLY TO SIGNS OR MORE EFFECTIVELY TO SILENCE. PROSTITUTION OF THE WORD IS THE MOST VISIBLE SYMPTOM OF ITS DEGRADATION; THERE IS NO UTTERANCE INTACT NO PURE ARTICULATION AND DOWN TO THE VERY THINGS SIGNIFIED EVERYTHING IS CORRUPTED BY REPETITIONS. WHY WOULD EACH GENERATION NOT LEARN A NEW IDIOM IF ONLY TO GIVE A NEW VIGOR TO OBJECTS? HOW LOVE AND HATE STRUGGLE AND SUFFER WITH THESE ANEMIC SYMBOLS? “LIFE” “DEATH"—METAPHYSICAL STEREOTYPES EXHAUSTED ENIGMAS. . . . MAN SHOULD CREATE ANOTHER ILLUSION OF REALITY AND INVENT TO THIS END OTHER WORDS SINCE HIS OWN LACK BLOOD AND AT THEIR STAGE OF AGONY THERE IS NO TRANSFUSION POSSIBLE.

AT THE OBSEQUIES OF DESIRE
A TINY CAVE YAWNS IN EACH CELL . . . WE KNOW WHERE DISEASES SET IN THEIR SITE THE SPECIFIC WEAKNESS OF THE ORGANS; BUT THIS UNSPECIFIABLE ILL . . . THIS OPPRESSION UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND OCEANS THIS DESIRE FOR AN IDEALLY BALEFUL POISON. . . .

THE VULGARITIES OF RENEWAL THE PROVOCATIONS OF THE SUN OF FOLIAGE OF SAP. . . . MY BLOOD DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE BUDS OPEN WHEN THE BIRD AND THE BEAST FROLIC. . . . I ENVY THE MAD THE SLEEPING DORMOUSE THE BEAR’S WINTERS THE SAGE’S DRYNESS; I WOULD EXCHANGE FOR THEIR TORPOR MY AGITATION THE FRENZY OF A VAGUE MURDERER WHO DREAMS OF CRIMES THIS SIDE OF BLOOD. AND MORE THAN THEM ALL HOW MUCH I ENVY THOSE EMPERORS OF THE DECADENCE SULLEN AND CRUEL WHO WERE STABBED AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR CRIMINAL COURSE!

I GIVE MYSELF UP TO SPACE LIKE A BLIND MAN’S TEARS. WHOSE WILL AM 1 WHO WILLS IN ME? I WISH SOME DEMON WOULD- CONCEIVE A CONSPIRACY AGAINST MAN: I WOULD JOIN IT. TIRED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OBSEQUIES OF MY DESIRES I SHOULD AT LAST HAVE AN IDEAL EXCUSE FOR ENNUI IS THE MARTYRDOM OF THOSE WHO LIVE AND DIE FOR NO BELIEF.

IRREFUTABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
EVERYTHING CONFIRMS IT FEEDS IT; IT CROWNS—KNOWING UNIMPEACHABLE—EVENTS FEELINGS THOUGHTS; NO MOMENT WHICH FAILS TO CONSECRATE IT NO IMPULSE WHICH FAILS TO EMPOWER IT NO REFLECTION WHICH FAILS TO REINFORCE IT. DIVINITY WHOSE KINGDOM IS LIMITLESS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FATALITY WHICH SERVES AND ILLUSTRATES IT HYPHEN BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IT UNITES IDENTIFIES AND FEEDS ON THEM BOTH. BESIDE ITS ARGUMENTS AND VERIFICATIONS THE SCIENCES THEMSELVES SEEM A JUMBLE OF WHIMS. NOTHING CAN DIMINISH THE FERVOR OF ITS DISTASTES: WHAT TRUTHS FLOURISHING IN A SPRING OF AXIOMS COULD DEFY ITS VISIONARY DOGMATISM ITS PROUD INSANITY? NO HEAT OF YOUTH NOR EVEN THE MIND’S DERANGEMENT RESISTS ITS CERTITUDES AND ITS VICTORIES ARE PROCLAIMED WITH ONE AND THE SAME VOICE BY WISDOM AND BY MADNESS. BEFORE ITS SEAMLESS EMPIRE BEFORE ITS LIMITLESS SOVEREIGNTY OUR KNEES BEND: EVERYTHING BEGINS IN IGNORANCE OF IT EVERYTHING ENDS BY YIELDING TO IT; NO ACTION EVADES IT NONE FAILS TO BE LED BACK TO IT. THE LAST WORD HERE ON EARTH IT ALONE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. . .

IN THE SECRET OF MORALISTS
WHEN WE HAVE STUFFED THE UNIVERSE WITH MELANCHOLY ALL WE HAVE LEFT TO LIGHT UP THE MIND WITH IS JOY IMPOSSIBLE RARE FLASHING JOY; AND IT IS WHEN WE NO LONGER HOPE THAT WE SUFFER THE FASCINATION OF HOPE. LIFE—A GIFT GIVEN TO THE LIVING BY THOSE OBSESSED WITH DEATH. . . . SINCE THE DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHTS IS NOT THAT OF OUR HEARTS WE SUSTAIN A SECRET INCLINATION FOR ALL THAT WE TRAMPLE DOWN. SAY A MAN REGISTERS THE CREAKING OF THE WORLD’S MACHINERY: IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS DREAMED TOO MUCH OF THE RESONANCE OF THE SPHERES; FAILING TO HEAR THEM HE ABASES HIMSELF TO HEAR ONLY THE DIN AROUND HIM. BITTER WORDS EMANATE FROM A WOUNDED SENSIBILITY FROM AN OFFENDED DELICACY. THE VENOM OF A LA ROCHEFOUCAULD A CHAMFORT WAS THE REVENGE THEY TOOK ON A WORLD DESIGNED FOR BRUTES. ALL GALL CONCEALS A REVENGE AND IS TRANSLATED INTO A SYSTEM: PESSIMISM—THAT CRUELTY OF THE CONQUERED WHO CANNOT FORGIVE LIFE FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEIR EXPECTATIONS.

THE GAIETY WHICH STRIKES MORTAL BLOWS .. . THE PLEASANTRY WHICH CONCEALS THE DAGGER UNDER A SMILE .. . I THINK OF CERTAIN IRONIES OF VOLTAIRE CERTAIN RETORTS OF RIVAROL THE STINGING WORDS OF MME. DU DEFFAND THE JEERS WHICH SHOW THROUGH SO MUCH ELEGANCE THE AGGRESSIVE FRIVOLITY OF THE SALONS THE SALLIES WHICH ENTERTAIN AND SLAUGHTER THE BITTERNESS CONTAINED IN AN EXCESS OF CIVILITY. . . . AND I THINK OF AN IDEAL MORALIST—A COMBINATION OF CYNICISM AND LYRIC ARDOR—EXALTED AND ICY VAGUE AND INCISIVE AS CLOSE TO ROUSSEAU’S REVERIES AS TO LACIOS' LIAISONS OR UNITING IN HIMSELF VAUVENARGUES AND SADE TACT AND TORMENT. . . . OBSERVER OF MORES IN HIMSELF HAVING NO NEED TO SEEK ELSEWHERE THE LEAST ATTENTION ON HOME GROUNDS WOULD SHOW HIM THE CONTRADICTIONS OF LIFE ALL OF WHOSE ASPECTS HE WOULD REFLECT SO WELL THAT ASHAMED OF DUPLICATION IT WOULD DISAPPEAR. . . .

NO ATTENTION WHOSE EXERCISE FAILS TO LEAD TO AN ACT OF ANNIHILATION: THIS IS THE FATALITY OF OBSERVATION WITH ALL THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH DERIVE FROM IT FOR THE OBSERVER FROM THE CLASSICAL MORALIST DOWN TO PROUST. EVERYTHING DISSOLVES UNDER THE SEARCHING EYE: PASSIONS LONG ATTACHMENTS ARDORS ARE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF SIMPLE MINDS FAITHFUL TO OTHERS AND TO THEMSELVES A TOUCH OF LUCIDITY IN THE “HEART” MAKES IT THE SEAT OF FEIGNED FEELINGS AND TURNS THE LOVER INTO ADOLPHE AND THE DISCONTENT INTO RENÉ. LOVING WE DO NOT EXAMINE LOVE; ACTING WE DO NOT MEDITATE UPON ACTION; IF I STUDY MY “NEIGHBOR” IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS CEASED TO BE MY NEIGHBOR AND I AM NO LONGER “MYSELF” IF I ANALYZE MYSELF: I BECOME AN OBJECT ALONG WITH ALL THE REST. THE BELIEVER WHO WEIGHS HIS FAITH ENDS BY PUTTING GOD IN THE SCALES AND SAFEGUARDS HIS FERVOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR OF LOSING IT. PLACED AT THE ANTIPODES OF NAÏVETE OF INTEGRAL AND AUTHENTIC EXISTENCE THE MORALIST EXHAUSTS HIMSELF IN A VIS-Á-VIS WITH HIMSELF AND WITH OTHERS: COMEDIAN MICROCOSM OF SECOND THOUGHTS HE DOES NOT ENDURE THE ARTIFICE WHICH MEN IN ORDER TO LIVE SPONTANEOUSLY ACCEPT AND INCORPORATE IN THEIR NATURE. EVERYTHING SEEMS CONVENTION: HE DIVULGES THE MOTIVES OF FEELINGS AND ACTIONS HE UNMASKS THE SIMULACRA OF CIVILIZATION BECAUSE HE SUFFERS AT HAVING GLIMPSED AND GONE BEYOND THEM; FOR THESE SIMULACRA GIVE LIFE THEY ARE LIFE WHEREAS HIS EXISTENCE IN CONTEMPLATING THEM STRAYS INTO THE SEARCH FOR A “NATURE” WHICH DOES NOT EXIST AND WHICH IF IT DID WOULD BE AS ALIEN TO HIM AS THE ARTIFICES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDED TO IT. ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY REDUCED TO ITS ELEMENTS EXPLAINED AND DISSECTED INVOLVES AN OPERATION MUCH DEADLIER TO THE OPERATOR THAN TO THE VICTIM. WE LIQUIDATE OUR FEELINGS BY PURSUING THEIR DETOURS AND OUR IMPULSES IF WE AMBUSH THEIR TRAJECTORY; AND WHEN WE DETAIL THE MOVEMENTS OF OTHERS IT IS NOT THEY WHO LOSE THEIR WAY. . . . EVERYTHING WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN SEEMS UNREASONABLE; BUT THOSE WHO MOVE CANNOT FAIL TO ADVANCE WHEREAS THE OBSERVER WHICHEVER WAY HE TURNS REGISTERS THEIR FUTILE TRIUMPH ONLY TO EXCUSE HIS OWN DEFEAT. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS LIFE ONLY IN THE INATTENTION TO LIFE.

MONASTIC FANTASY
THOSE DAYS WHEN WOMEN TOOK THE VEIL TO CONCEAL FROM THE WORLD AND AS IF FROM THEMSELVES THE ADVANCES OF AGE THE DIMINUTION OF THEIR BEAUTY THE FADING OF THEIR CHARMS . . . WHEN MEN WEARY OF FAME AND CEREMONY LEFT THE COURT TO TAKE REFUGE IN DEVOTION. . . . THE FASHION OF CONVERSION FOR DISCRETION’S SAKE VANISHED WITH THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY: PASCAL’S SHADOW AND JACQUELINE’S SHADE FELL LIKE INVISIBLE GLAMORS OVER THE MEREST COURTESAN OVER THE MOST FRIVOLOUS BEAUTY. BUT PORT-ROYAL HAS BEEN DESTROYED FOREVER AND WITH IT THE PLACES FAVORABLE TO DISCREET AND SOLITARY AGONIES. NO MORE COQUETRY OF THE CONVENT: WHERE NOW TO LOOK IN ORDER TO SOFTEN OUR DEGRADATIONS FOR A CONTEXT AT ONCE DIM AND SUMPTUOUS? AN EPICUREAN LIKE SAINT-EVREMOND IMAGINED ONE TO HIS LIKING AND AS COMFORTING AND LAX AS HIS OWN SAVOIR-VIVRE. IN THOSE DAYS ONE STILL HAD TO TAKE GOD INTO ACCOUNT ADJUST HIM TO DISBELIEF INCLUDE HIM IN SOLITUDE. A TRANSACTION CRAMMED WITH CHARM IRREMEDIABLY VANISHED! WE LACK CLOISTERS AS DISPOSSESSED AS VACANT AS OUR SOULS IN ORDER TO LOSE OURSELVES THERE WITHOUT THE ATTENDANCE OF THE HEAVENS AND IN A PURITY OF ABSENT IDEALS CLOISTERS BEFITTING THE DISABUSED ANGELS WHO IN THEIR FALL BY DINT OF VANQUISHED ILLUSIONS WOULD REMAIN STILL IMMACULATE. WE LONG FOR A VOGUE OF RETREATS IN AN ETERNITY WITHOUT FAITH AN ASSUMPTION OF THE HABIT IN NOTHINGNESS AN ORDER RELEASED FROM MYSTERIES AND FROM WHICH NO “BROTHER” WOULD CLAIM ANYTHING DISDAINING HIS SALVATION EVEN AS THAT OF OTHERS AN ORDER OF IMPOSSIBLE SALVATION. . . .

IN HONOR OF MADNESS
. . . BETTER I WERE DISTRACT:
SO SHOULD MY THOUGHTS HE SEVER'D FRONT MY GRIEFS.
—KING LEAR

THE EXCLAMATION IS WRUNG FROM GLOUCESTER BY LEAR’S MADNESS. . . . IN ORDER TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM OUR GRIEFS OUR LAST RESORT IS DELIRIUM; SUBJECT TO ITS DISTRACTIONS WE NO LONGER MEET OUR AFFLICTIONS: PARALLEL TO OUR PAINS AND ADJACENT TO OUR MELANCHOLIES WE DIVAGATE IN A SALUTARY DARKNESS. WHEN WE CURSE THAT ITCH CALLED LIFE AND WHEN WE ARE WEARY OF THE SCABS OF DURATION THE LUNATIC’S ASSURANCE AMID HIS TRIBULATIONS BECOMES A TEMPTATION AND A MODEL: LET SOME KIND FATE RID US OF OUR REASON! NO ESCAPE SO LONG AS THE INTELLECT REMAINS ATTENTIVE TO THE HEART’S IMPULSES SO LONG AS IT DOES NOT BREAK THE HABIT! I ASPIRE TO THE IDIOT’S NIGHTS TO HIS MINERAL SUFFERINGS TO THE BLISS OF GROANING WITH INDIFFERENCE AS IF THEY WERE SOMEONE ELSE’S GROANS TO THE CALVARY IN WHICH WE ARE STRANGERS TO OURSELVES IN WHICH OUR OWN CRIES COME FROM ELSEWHERE TO AN ANONYMOUS HELL WHERE WE DANCE AND JEER AS WE DESTROY OURSELVES. TO LIVE AND DIE IN THE THIRD PERSON .. . TO BE EXILED - IN MYSELF TO DISSOCIATE MYSELF FROM MY NAME FOREVER DISTRACTED FROM THE MAN I WAS .. . TO ATTAIN AT LAST—SINCE LIFE IS ENDURABLE ONLY AT THIS PRICE—THE WISDOM OF DEMENTIA. . . .

MY HEROES
WHEN WE ARE YOUNG WE LOOK FOR HEROES. I HAVE HAD MINE: KLEIST KAROLINE VON GÜNDERODE NERVAL OTTO WEININGER. . . . INTOXICATED BY THEIR SUICIDES I WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY ALONE HAD GONE TO THE END THAT THEY DREW IN DEATH THE RIGHT CONCLUSION FROM THEIR THWARTED OR FULFILLED LOVES FROM THEIR BROKEN MINDS OR PHILOSOPHIC PAIN. THAT A MAN SHOULD SURVIVE HIS PASSION WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM CONTEMPTIBLE OR ABJECT IN MY EYES: WHICH IS TO SAY THAT HUMANITY WAS SUPERFLUOUS. I DISCOVERED IN IT AN INFINITESIMAL NUMBER OF LOFTY RESOLUTIONS AND SO MUCH COMPROMISE WITH LIFE THAT I TURNED AWAY FROM IT DETERMINED TO PUT AN END TO IT ALL BEFORE I WAS THIRTY. BUT AS THE YEARS WENT BY I LOST THE PRIDE OF YOUTH: EACH DAY LIKE A LESSON IN HUMILITY I REMINDED MYSELF THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE THAT I WAS BETRAYING MY DREAMS AMONG MEN ROTTEN WITH . . . LIFE. EXASPERATED BY THE EXPECTATION OF NO LONGER EXISTING I CONSIDERED IT A DUTY TO CLEAVE MY FLESH WHEN DAWN BROKE AFTER A NIGHT OF LOVE AND THAT IT WAS A NAMELESS DEGRADATION TO SULLY BY MEMORY AN EXCESS OF SIGHS. OR AT OTHER MOMENTS HOW WAS ONE TO INSULT DURATION FURTHER WHEN ONE HAD GRASPED EVERYTHING IN A DILATION WHICH ENTHRONES PRIDE IN THE VERY HEAVENS? I THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY ACTION A MAN COULD PERFORM WITHOUT SHAME WAS TO TAKE HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DIMINISH HIMSELF IN THE SUCCESSION OF DAYS AND THE INERTIA OF MISERY. NO ELECT I KEPT TELLING MYSELF BUT THOSE WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE. EVEN NOW I HAVE MORE ESTEEM FOR A CONCIERGE WHO HANGS HIMSELF THAN FOR A LIVING POET. MAN IS PROVISIONALLY EXEMPT FROM SUICIDE: THAT IS HIS ONE GLORY HIS ONE EXCUSE. BUT HE IS NOT AWARE OF IT AND CALLS COWARDICE THE COURAGE OF THOSE WHO DARED TO RAISE THEMSELVES BY DEATH ABOVE THEMSELVES. WE ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY A TACIT PACT TO GO ON TO THE LAST BREATH: THIS PACT WHICH CEMENTS OUR SOLIDARITY DOOMS US NONETHELESS—OUR ENTIRE RACE IS STRICKEN BY ITS INFAMY. WITHOUT SUICIDE NO SALVATION. STRANGE! THAT DEATH THOUGH ETERNAL HAS NOT BECOME PART OF OUR “BEHAVIOR": SOLE REALITY IT CANNOT BECOME A VOGUE. THUS AS LIVING MEN WE ARE ALL RETARDED. . . .

THE SIMPLE-MINDED
CONSIDER THE ACCENT WITH WHICH A MAN UTTERS THE WORD “TRUTH” THE INFLECTION OF ASSURANCE OR RESERVE HE USES THE EXPRESSION OF BELIEVING OR DOUBTING IT AND YOU WILL BE EDIFIED AS TO THE NATURE OF HIS OPINIONS AND THE QUALITY OF HIS MIND. NO WORD IS EMPTIER; YET MEN MAKE AN IDOL OF IT AND CONVERT ITS NON-MEANING AT ONCE INTO A CRITERION AND A GOAL OF THOUGHT. THIS SUPERSTITION—WHICH EXCUSES THE VULGARIAN AND DISQUALIFIES THE PHILOSOPHER—RESULTS FROM THE ENCROACHMENT OF HOPE UPON LOGIC. YOU ARE TOLD OVER AND OVER: TRUTH IS INACCESSIBLE; YET IT MUST BE SEARCHED FOR ASPIRED TO FOUGHT OVER. BEHOLD A RESTRICTION WHICH FAILS TO SEPARATE YOU FROM THOSE WHO DECLARE THEY HAVE FOUND IT: THE MAIN THING IS TO BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE: TO POSSESS TRUTH OR TO ASPIRE TO IT ARE TWO ACTIONS WHICH PROCEED FROM ONE AND THE SAME ATTITUDE. WE MAKE AN EXCEPTION OF ONE WORD AS OF ANOTHER: TERRIBLE USURPATION OF LANGUAGE! I CALL SIMPLE-MINDED ANY MAN WHO SPEAKS OF TRUTH WITH CONVICTION: IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS CAPITAL LETTERS IN RESERVE AND EMPLOYS THEM NAIVELY WITHOUT DECEPTION WITHOUT DISDAIN. AS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER HIS SLIGHTEST INDULGENCE IN THIS IDOLATRY EXPOSES HIM: THE CITIZEN IN HIM HAS WON OUT OVER THE SOLITARY. HOPE EMERGING FROM A THOUGHT—THAT SADDENS US OR MAKES US SMILE. . . . THERE IS AN INDECENCY ABOUT PUTTING TOO MUCH SOUL IN SUCH WORDS: THE CHILDISHNESS OF ANY ENTHUSIASM FOR KNOWLEDGE. . . . AND IT IS TIME THAT PHILOSOPHY CASTING DISCREDIT UPON TRUTH FREED ITSELF FROM ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

POVERTY: MENTAL STIMULANT
TO KEEP THE MIND VIGILANT THERE IS ONLY COFFEE DISEASE INSOMNIA OR THE OBSESSION OF DEATH; POVERTY CONTRIBUTES TO THIS CONDITION IN EQUAL MEASURE IF NOT MORE EFFECTIVELY: TERROR OF TOMORROW AS MUCH AS THAT OF ETERNITY MONEY TROUBLES AS MUCH AS METAPHYSICAL FEARS EXCLUDE REPOSE AND OBLIVION. ALL OUR HUMILIATIONS COME FROM THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT BRING OURSELVES TO DIE OF HUNGER. WE PAY DEARLY FOR THIS COWARDICE. TO BE DEPENDENT ON MEN WITHOUT THE VOCATION OF BEGGARS! TO ABASE OURSELVES BEFORE THESE DRESSED-UP LUCKY INFATUATED MARMOSETS! TO BE AT THE MERCY OF THESE CARICATURES UNWORTHY OF CONTEMPT! IT IS THE SHAME OF SEEKING ANYTHING WHICH EXCITES THE DESIRE TO ANNIHILATE THIS PLANET WITH ITS HIERARCHIES AND THE DEGRADATIONS THEY INVOLVE. SOCIETY IS NOT A DISEASE IT IS A DISASTER: WHAT A STUPID MIRACLE THAT ONE CAN LIVE IN IT! WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE IT BETWEEN RAGE AND INDIFFERENCE IT BECOMES INEXPLICABLE THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEMOLISH ITS STRUCTURE THAT HITHERTO THERE HAVE NOT BEEN MINDS DESPERATE AND DECENT ENOUGH TO RAZE IT TO THE GROUND WITHOUT A TRACE.

THERE IS MORE THAN ONE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN BEGGING FOR A COIN IN THE CITY AND WAITING FOR AN ANSWER FROM THE SILENCE OF THE UNIVERSE. AVARICE PRESIDES OVER MEN’S HEARTS AND OVER MATTER. AWAY WITH THIS STINGY EXISTENCE! IT HOARDS MONEY AND MYSTERIES: PURSES ARE AS INACCESSIBLE AS THE DEPTHS OF THE UNKNOWN. BUT—MAYBE SOMEDAY THAT UNKNOWN WILL REVEAL ITSELF AND OPEN ITS TREASURIES; NEVER SO LONG AS THERE IS BLOOD IN HIS VEINS WILL THE RICH MAN UNEARTH HIS WEALTH. . . . HE WILL CONFESS HIS SHAMES HIS VICES HIS CRIMES: HE WILL LIE ABOUT HIS FORTUNE; HE WILL MAKE YOU EVERY CONFIDENCE HAND YOU HIS LIFE: YOU WILL NOT SHARE HIS LAST SECRET HIS PECUNIARY SECRET. . . .

POVERTY IS NOT A TRANSITORY STATE: IT COINCIDES WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CIRCUIT OF GOODS THAT YOU MUST STRUGGLE FOR EVEN A BREATH AND CONQUER AIR ITSELF AND HOPE AND SLEEP AND THAT EVEN WHEN SOCIETY DISAPPEARS NATURE WILL BE NO LESS INCLEMENT NO LESS PERVERTED. NO PATERNAL PRINCIPLE WATCHED OVER THE CREATION; EVERYWHERE BURIED TREASURES; BEHOLD THE MISER AS DEMIURGE THE GOD ON HIGH A SLY SKINFLINT. IT IS HE WHO IMPLANTED IN YOU THE TERROR OF TOMORROW: IT IS SCARCELY SURPRISING THAT RELIGION ITSELF SHOULD BE A FORM OF THIS TERROR.

FOR THE PAUPERS OF ETERNITY POVERTY IS A KIND OF STIMULANT THEY HAVE TAKEN ONCE AND FOR ALL WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ANTIDOTE OR A KIND OF INNATE AWARENESS WHICH BEFORE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE COULD DESCRIBE ITS INFERNO. . . .

INVOCATION TO INSOMNIA
I WAS SEVENTEEN AND I BELIEVED IN PHILOSOPHY. WHAT DID NOT RELATE TO PHILOSOPHY SEEMED TO ME EITHER A SIN OR SLOPS: POETS? JUGGLERS GOOD FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF TRIVIAL WOMEN; ACTION? IMBECILITY IN DELIRIUM; LOVE DEATH? LOW EXCUSES REJECTING THE HONOR OF CONCEPTS. FOUL ODORS OF A UNIVERSE UNWORTHY OF THE MIND’S PERFUME. . . . THE CONCRETE WHAT AN ABOMINATION! DELIGHT OR SUFFERING WHAT SHAMES! ONLY ABSTRACTION SEEMED TO PALPITATE WITH LIFE: I GAVE MYSELF UP TO ANCILLARY EXPLOITS LEST SOME NOBLER OBJECT MIGHT MAKE ME INFRINGE MY PRINCIPLES AND SUBMIT TO THE DEGRADATIONS OF THE HEART. I TOLD MYSELF OVER AND OVER: ONLY THE BROTHEL IS COMPATIBLE WITH METAPHYSICS; AND I COVETED—TO ESCAPE POETRY—THE EYES OF HOUSEMAIDS THE SIGHS OF WHORES.

. . . WHEN YOU CAME INSOMNIA TO SHAKE MY FLESH AND MY PRIDE YOU WHO TRANSFORM THE CHILDISH BRUTE GIVE NUANCE TO THE INSTINCTS FOCUS TO DREAMS YOU WHO IN A SINGLE NIGHT GRANT MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN DAYS SPENT IN REPOSE AND TO REDDENED EYELIDS REVEAL YOURSELF A MORE IMPORTANT EVENT THAN THE NAMELESS DISEASES OR THE DISASTERS OF TIME! YOU MADE ME HEAR THE SNORE OF HEALTH HUMAN BEINGS PLUNGED INTO SONOROUS OBLIVION WHILE MY SOLITUDE ENGROSSED THE SURROUNDING DARK AND BECAME HUGER THAN THE NIGHT. EVERYTHING SLEPT SLEPT FOREVER. THERE WAS NO DAWN: I SHALL LIE AWAKE THIS WAY UNTIL THE END OF TIME: THEY WILL WAIT FOR ME THEN TO ASK ME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BLANK SPACE OF MY DREAMS. . . . EACH NIGHT WAS LIKE THE OTHERS EACH NIGHT WAS ETERNAL. AND I FELT ONE WITH ALL THOSE WHO CANNOT SLEEP WITH ALL THOSE UNKNOWN BROTHERS. LIKE THE CORRUPT AND THE FANATICAL I HAD A SECRET; LIKE THEM I BELONGED TO A CLAN TO WHICH EVERYTHING COULD BE EXCUSED GIVEN SACRIFICED: THE CLAN OF THE SLEEPLESS. I GRANTED GENIUS TO THE FIRST-COMER WHOSE EYELIDS WERE HEAVY WITH FATIGUE AND ADMIRED NO MIND THAT COULD SLEEP WERE IT THE GLORY OF THE STATE OF ART OR OF LETTERS. I WOULD HAVE WORSHIPPED A TYRANT WHO—TO TAKE REVENGE ON HIS NIGHTS—WOULD HAVE FORBIDDEN REST PUNISHED OBLIVION PRESCRIBED DISASTER AND FEVERS.

AND IT WAS THEN THAT I APPEALED TO PHILOSOPHY; BUT THERE IS NO IDEA WHICH COMFORTS IN THE DARK NO SYSTEM WHICH RESISTS THOSE VIGILS. THE ANALYSES OF INSOMNIA UNDO ALL CERTAINTIES. WEARY OF SUCH DESTRUCTION I CAME TO THE POINT OF TELLING MYSELF: NO MORE VACILLATION SLEEP OR DIE . . . RECONQUER SLEEP OR DISAPPEAR. . . .

BUT THIS RECONQUEST IS NO EASY MATTER: WHEN YOU COME CLOSE TO IT YOU REALIZE HOW DEEPLY YOU HAVE BEEN MARKED BY THE NIGHTS. YOU LOVE? . . . YOUR IMPULSES WILL BE FOREVER CORRUPTED; YOU WILL EMERGE FROM EACH “ECSTASY” LIKE A SCARECROW OF PLEASURE; YOU WILL CONFRONT THE GLANCES OF YOUR TOO IMMEDIATE COMPANION WITH A CRIMINAL COUNTENANCE; YOU WILL ANSWER HER SINCERE GESTURES WITH THE IRRITATIONS OF AN ENVENOMED PLEASURE; HER INNOCENCE WITH A GUILTY POETRY FOR EVERYTHING FOR YOU WILL BECOME POETRY BUT A POETRY OF TRANSGRESSION. . . . CRYSTALLINE IDEAS HAPPY SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS? YOU WILL NOT THINK ANY MORE: IT WILL BE AN EXPLOSION A LAVA OF CONCEPTS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE AND WITHOUT ORDER A VOMIT OF AGGRESSIVE CONCEPTS SPEWED FROM YOUR GUTS PUNISHMENTS THE FLESH INFLICTS UPON ITSELF THE MIND BEING A VICTIM OF THE HUMORS AND OUT OF THE QUESTION. . . . YOU WILL SUFFER FROM EVERYTHING AND TO EXCESS: THE WINDS WILL SEEM GALES; EVERY TOUCH A DAGGER SMILES SLAPS; TRIFLES CATACLYSMS. WAKING MAY COME TO AN END BUT ITS LIGHT SURVIVES WITHIN YOU; ONE DOES NOT SEE IN THE DARK WITH IMPUNITY ONE DOES NOT GATHER ITS LESSONS WITHOUT DANGER; THERE ARE EYES WHICH CAN NO LONGER LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE SUN AND SOULS AFFLICTED BY NIGHTS FROM WHICH THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER. . . .

PROFILE OF THE WICKED MAN
WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS NOT HAVING DONE MORE EVIL THAN HE MIGHT OR MUST FOR HIS NOT COMMITTING MURDER WREAKING SUBTLER VENGEANCES FOR NOT HAVING OBEYED THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE BLOOD RUSHING TO HIS HEAD? HIS MOODS HIS EDUCATION? CERTAINLY NOT AND STILL LESS A NATIVE GOODNESS; BUT MERELY THE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA OF DEATH. INCLINED TO FORGIVE NO ONE ANYTHING HE PARDONS ALL; THE SLIGHTEST INSULT AROUSES HIS INSTINCTS; HE FORGETS IT THE NEXT MOMENT. ENOUGH FOR HIM TO IMAGINE HIS OWN CORPSE AND TO APPLY THIS METHOD TO OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE SUDDENLY SOOTHED; THE FIGURE OF WHAT DECOMPOSES MAKES HIM GOOD—AND COWARDLY: NO WISDOM (NOR CHARITY) WITHOUT MACABRE OBSESSIONS. THE HEALTHY MAN PROUD OF EXISTING TAKES HIS REVENGE LISTENS TO HIS BLOOD AND HIS NERVES HEEDS HIS PREJUDICES ANSWERS BLOW FOR BLOW AND KILLS. BUT THE MIND UNDERMINED BY THE FEAR OF DEATH NO LONGER REACTS TO EXTERNAL SOLICITATIONS: IT SKETCHES OUT ACTIONS AND LEAVES THEM UNFINISHED; REFLECTS UPON HONOR AND LOSES IT . . . TRIES OUT PASSIONS AND DISSECTS THEM. . . . THIS DREAD WHICH ACCOMPANIES ITS GESTURES ENERVATES THEIR VIGOR; ITS DESIRES EXPIRE BEFORE THE VISION OF UNIVERSAL INSIGNIFICANCE. FILLED WITH HATRED BY NECESSITY UNABLE TO BE SO BY CONVICTION THE PLOTS AND CRIMES OF SUCH A MAN ARE HALTED IN MID-COURSE; LIKE ALL MEN HE CONCEALS A MURDERER INSIDE HIMSELF BUT A MURDERER IMBUED WITH RESIGNATION AND TOO WEARY TO CRUSH HIS ENEMIES OR TO CREATE NEW ONES. HE DREAMS FOREHEAD ON HIS DAGGER AND AS THOUGH DISAPPOINTED BEFORE THEY HAPPEN BY EVERY CRIME; CONSIDERED A GOOD MAN BY EVERYONE HE WOULD BE WICKED IF HE DID NOT FIND IT FUTILE TO BE SO.

VIEWS ON TOLERANCE
SIGNS OF LIFE: CRUELTY FANATICISM INTOLERANCE; SIGHS OF DECADENCE: AMENITY UNDERSTANDING INDULGENCE. .. . SO LONG AS AN INSTITUTION IS BASED ON STRONG INSTINCTS IT ADMITS NEITHER ENEMIES NOR HERETICS: IT MASSACRES BURNS OR IMPRISONS THEM. STAKES SCAFFOLDS PRISONS! IT IS NOT WICKEDNESS WHICH INVENTED THEM BUT CONVICTION ANY UTTER CONVICTION. ONCE A BELIEF IS ESTABLISHED THE POLICE WILL GUARANTEE ITS “TRUTH” SOONER OR LATER. JESUS—ONCE HE WANTED TO TRIUMPH AMONG MEN—SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORESEE TORQUEMADA INELUCTABLE CONSEQUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY TRANSLATED INTO HISTORY. AND IF THE LAMB FAILED TO ANTICIPATE THE TORTURER OF THE CROSS HIS FUTURE DEFENDER THEN HE DESERVES HIS NICKNAME. BY THE INQUISITION THE CHURCH PROVED THAT IT STILL POSSESSED ENORMOUS VITALITY; SIMILARLY THE KINGS BY THEIR “ROYAL WILL” ALL AUTHORITIES HAVE THEIR BASTILLE: THE MORE POWERFUL AN INSTITUTION THE LESS HUMANE. THE ENERGY OF A PERIOD IS MEASURED BY THE BEINGS THAT SUFFER IN IT AND IT IS BY THE VICTIMS IT PROVOKES THAT A RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL BELIEF IS AFFIRMED BESTIALITY BEING THE PRIMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY SUCCESS IN TIME. HEADS FALL WHERE AN IDEA PREVAILS; IT CAN PREVAIL ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER IDEAS AND OF THE HEADS WHICH CONCEIVED OR DEFENDED THEM.

HISTORY CONFIRMS SKEPTICISM; YET IT IS AND LIVES ONLY BY TRAMPLING OVER IT; NO EVENT RISES OUT OF DOUBT BUT ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF EVENTS LEAD TO IT AND JUSTIFY IT. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT TOLERANCE—SUPREME GOOD ON EARTH—IS AT THE SAME TIME THE SUPREME EVIL TO ADMIT ALL POINTS OF VIEW THE MOST DISPARATE BELIEFS THE MOST CONTRADICTORY OPINIONS PRESUPPOSES A GENERAL STATE OF LASSITUDE AND STERILITY. WHENCE WE ARRIVE AT THIS MIRACLE: THE ADVERSARIES COEXIST—BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER BE ADVERSARIES; OPPOSING DOCTRINES RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER’S MERITS BECAUSE NONE HAS THE VIGOR TO ASSERT ITSELF. A RELIGION DIES WHEN IT TOLERATES TRUTHS WHICH EXCLUDE IT; AND THE GOD IN WHOSE NAME ONE NO LONGER KILLS IS DEAD INDEED. AN ABSOLUTE PERISHES: A VAGUE GLOW OF EARTHLY PARADISE APPEARS A FUGITIVE GLEAM FOR INTOLERANCE CONSTITUTES THE LAW OF HUMAN AFFAIRS. COLLECTIVITIES ARE REINFORCED ONLY UNDER TYRANNIES AND DISINTEGRATE IN A REGIME OF CLEMENCY; THEN IN A BURST OF ENERGY THEY BEGIN TO STRANGLE THEIR LIBERTIES AND TO WORSHIP THEIR JAILERS CROWNED OR COMMONERS.

THE PERIODS OF FEAR PREDOMINATE OVER THOSE OF CALM; MAN IS MUCH MORE VEXED BY THE ABSENCE THAN BY THE PROFUSION OF EVENTS; THUS HISTORY IS THE BLOODY PRODUCT OF HIS REJECTION OF BOREDOM.

SARTORIAL PHILOSOPHY
WITH WHAT TENDERNESS AND WHAT JEALOUSY MY THOUGHTS TURN TOWARD THE DESERT FATHERS AND TOWARD THE CYNICS! THE ABJECTION OF OWNING THE MEREST OBJECT: THIS TABLE THIS BED THESE RAGS. . . . CLOTHES GET BETWEEN US AND NOTHINGNESS. LOOK AT YOUR BODY IN A MIRROR: YOU WILL REALIZE THAT YOU ARE MORTAL; RUN YOUR FINGERS OVER YOUR RIBS AS THOUGH ACROSS A GUITAR AND YOU WILL SEE HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE GRAVE. IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE DRESSED THAT WE ENTERTAIN IMMORTALITY: HOW CAN WE DIE WHEN WE WEAR A NECKTIE? THE CORPSE THAT DECKS ITSELF OUT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE ITSELF AND IMAGINING ETERNITY APPROPRIATES THAT ILLUSION. FLESH COVERS THE SKELETON CLOTHES COVER THE FLESH: SUBTERFUGE OF NATURE AND OF MAN INSTINCTIVE AND CONVENTIONAL DECEPTIONS: A GENTLEMAN CANNOT BE KNEADED OF CLAY AND DUST. . . . DIGNITY DECENCY—SO MANY ESCAPES IN THE FACE OF THE IRREMEDIABLE. AND WHEN YOU PUT ON A HAT WHO WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE SOJOURNED AMONG ENTRAILS OR THAT THE WORMS WILL GORGE ON YOUR FAT?

. . . THIS IS WHY I SHALL ABANDON THESE RAGS AND CASTING AWAY THE MASK OF MY DAYS FLEE THE TIME WHEN IN COLLUSION WITH THE OTHERS I STRIVE TO BETRAY MYSELF. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SOLITARIES STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WITH THEMSELVES; IN THE DESERT OR IN THE STREET DELIGHTING IN THEIR NAKEDNESS THEY ATTAINED TO THE SUPREME FORTUNE: THEY WERE THE EQUALS OF THE DEAD. . . .

AMONG THE DREGS
TO CONSOLE MYSELF FOR THE REMORSE OF SLOTH I TAKE THE PATH TO THE LOWER DEPTHS IMPATIENT TO DEGRADE MYSELF AND IDENTIFY WITH THE GUTTER. I KNOW THESE GRANDILOQUENT STINKING SNEERING BUMS; ENGULFED IN THEIR FILTH I TAKE MY PLEASURE IN THEIR FETID BREATH NO LESS THAN IN THEIR VERVE. PITILESS FOR THOSE WHO SUCCEED THEIR GENIUS FOR DOING NOTHING COMPELS ADMIRATION THOUGH THE SPECTACLE THEY AFFORD IS THE SADDEST IN THE WORLD: POETS WITHOUT TALENT WHORES WITHOUT CLIENTS BUSINESSMEN WITHOUT A PENNY LOVERS WITHOUT GLANDS INFERNO OF WOMEN NO ONE WANTS. . . . BEHOLD THEN I TELL MYSELF MAN’S NEGATIVE FULFILLMENT BEHOLD LAID BARE THIS BEING WHO PRETENDS TO A DIVINE LINEAGE PATHETIC COUNTERFEITER OF THE ABSOLUTE. . . . HERE IS WHERE HE WAS TO END IN THIS SPITTING IMAGE OF HIMSELF MUD GOD NEVER LAID A HAND ON BEAST NO ANGEL HAS A PART IN INFINITY BEGOTTEN IN MOANS SOUL RISEN OUT OF A SPASM. .. . I CONTEMPLATE THAT DIM DESPAIR OF SPERMATOZOA THAT HAVE REACHED THEIR END THESE FUNERAL COUNTENANCES OF THE RACE. I AM REASSURED: I HAVE A WAY TO GO STILL. . . . THEN I AM FRIGHTENED: SHALL I TOO FALL SO LOW? AND I HATE THAT TOOTHLESS CRONE THIS RHYMER WITHOUT VERSES THESE IMPOTENTS OF LOVE AND AFFAIRS THESE MODELS OF THE DISHONOR OF THE MIND AND THE FLESH. . . . THE MAN’S EYES OVERWHELM ME; I WANTED TO REAP ON CONTACT WITH THESE WRECKS A HARVEST OF PRIDE; I TAKE AWAY A SHUDDER LIKE THE ONE A LIVING MAN WOULD EXPERIENCE WHO TO DELIGHT IN NOT BEING DEAD PILFERED A COFFIN. . . .

ON AN ENTREPRENEUR OF IDEAS
HE TRIES EVERYTHING AND FOR HIM EVERYTHING SUCCEEDS; NOTHING OF WHICH HE IS NOT THE CONTEMPORARY. SO MUCH VIGOR IN THE ARTIFICES OF THE INTELLECT SO MUCH READINESS TO CONFRONT ALL THE REALMS OF THE MIND AND OF FASHION-—FROM METAPHYSICS TO MOVIES—DAZZLES MUST DAZZLE. NO PROBLEM RESISTS HIM NO PHENOMENON IS FOREIGN TO HIM NO TEMPTATION LEAVES HIM INDIFFERENT. HE IS A CONQUEROR AND HAS BUT ONE SECRET: HIS LACK OF EMOTION; NOTHING KEEPS HIM FROM DEALING WITH ANYTHING SINCE HE DOES SO WITH NO ACCENT OF HIS OWN. HIS CONSTRUCTIONS ARE MAGNIFICENT BUT WITHOUT SALT: CATEGORIES SWELL WITH INTIMATE EXPERIENCES CLASSIFIED AS IN A FILE OF DISASTERS OR A CATALOGUE OF ANXIETIES. HERE ARE RANGED THE TRIBULATIONS OF MAN AS WELL AS THE POETRY OF HIS LACERATION. THE IRREMEDIABLE HAS TURNED INTO A SYSTEM EVEN A SIDE SHOW DISPLAYED LIKE AN ARTICLE OF COMMON COMMERCE A TRUE MASS PRODUCT OF ANGUISH. THE PUBLIC DELIGHTS IN IT; THE NIHILISM OF THE BOULEVARD AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE CAFÉ FEED ON IT.

THINKER WITHOUT FATE INFINITELY EMPTY AND MARVELOUSLY AMPLE HE EXPLOITS HIS THOUGHT WANTS IT TO BE ON EVERY MOUTH. NO DESTINY PURSUES HIM: BORN IN THE AGE OF MATERIALISM HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ITS FACILITY AND GIVEN IT AN UNIMAGINABLE EXTENSION; OUT OF ROMANTICISM HE WOULD HAVE CONSTITUTED A SUMMA OF REVERIES; APPEARING IN THE WORLD OF THEOLOGY HE WOULD HAVE WIELDED GOD LIKE ANY OTHER CONCEPT. HIS SKILL IN CONFRONTING THE GREAT PROBLEMS IS DISCONCERTING: EVERYTHING IS REMARKABLE EXCEPT AUTHENTICITY. BASICALLY NON-POET IF HE SPEAKS OF NOTHINGNESS HE LACKS ITS SHUDDER; HIS DISGUSTS ARE PONDERED; HIS EXASPERATIONS CONTROLLED AND INVENTED AFTER THE FACT; BUT HIS WILL SUPERNATURALLY EFFECTIVE IS AT THE SAME TIME SO LUCID THAT HE COULD BE A POET IF HE WANTED TO AND I SHOULD ADD A SAINT IF HE INSISTED. . . . HAVING NEITHER PREFERENCES NOR OPPOSITIONS HIS OPINIONS ARE ACCIDENTS; ONE REGRETS THAT HE BELIEVES IN THEM; ONLY THE MOVEMENT THE METHOD OF HIS THOUGHT IS OF INTEREST. WERE I TO HEAR MM PREACH FROM THE PULPIT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED SO TRUE IS IT THAT HE LOCATES HIMSELF BEYOND ALL TRUTHS MASTERS THEM SO THAT NONE IS NECESSARY OR ORGANIC TO HIM. . . .

ADVANCING LIKE AN EXPLORER HE CONQUERS REALM AFTER REALM; HIS STEPS NO LESS THAN HIS THOUGHTS ARE ENTERPRISES; HIS BRAIN IS NOT THE ENEMY OF HIS INSTINCTS; HE RISES ABOVE THE REST HAVING SUFFERED NEITHER FATIGUE NOR THAT VEHEMENT MORTIFICATION WHICH PARALYZES DESIRE. SON OF A PERIOD HE EXPRESSES ITS CONTRADICTIONS ITS FUTILE DILATION; AND WHEN HE FLUNG HIMSELF FORWARD IN ITS CONQUEST HE EMPLOYED SO MUCH PERTINACITY AND STUBBORNNESS THAT HIS SUCCESS AND HIS RENOWN EQUAL THOSE OF THE SWORD AND REHABILITATE THE MIND BY MEANS WHICH HITHERTO WERE HATEFUL OR UNKNOWN TO IT.

TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT
CONFRONTING THINKERS WITHOUT PATHOS CHARACTER AND INTENSITY WHO MODEL THEMSELVES ON THE FORMS OF THEIR TIME APPEAR OTHERS OF WHOM WE FEEL THAT APPEARING WHENEVER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME THEMSELVES UNCONCERNED BY THEIR AGE DRAWING THEIR THOUGHTS FROM THEIR OWN DEPTHS FROM THE SPECIFIC ETERNITY OF THEIR FLAWS. THEY TAKE FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT ONLY THE SURFACE A FEW PECULIARITIES OF STYLE A FEW CHARACTERISTIC TURNS OF A GIVEN DEVELOPMENT. IN LOVE WITH THEIR FATE THEY SUGGEST EXPLOSIONS TRAGIC AND SOLITARY FIGURATIONS SOMETHING BETWEEN APOCALYPSE AND PSYCHIATRY. A KIERKEGAARD A NIETZSCHE HAD THEY APPEARED IN THE MOST ANODYNE AGE WOULD HAVE HAD NO LESS TREMULOUS NO LESS INCENDIARY AN INSPIRATION. THEY PERISHED IN THEIR FLAMES; A FEW CENTURIES EARLIER THEY WOULD HAVE PERISHED IN THOSE OF THE STAKE: VIS-A-VIS GENERAL TRUTHS THEY WERE PREDESTINED TO HERESY IT MATTERS LITTLE THAT ONE BE ENGULFED IN ONE’S OWN FIRE OR IN THAT KINDLED FOR YOU: THE TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT MUST BE PAID FOR IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE VISCERA THE BLOOD THE MISERIES AND THE VICES CONVERGE TO BEGET THEM. IMPREGNATED WITH SUBJECTIVITY WE PERCEIVE A SELF BEHIND EACH OF THEM: EVERYTHING BECOMES CONFESSION: A SHRIEK OF THE FLESH IS AT THE SOURCE OF THE MOST BANAL UTTERANCE; EVEN A THEORY OF IMPERSONAL APPEARANCE SERVES ONLY TO BETRAY ITS AUTHOR HIS SECRETS HIS SUFFERINGS: NO UNIVERSALITY WHICH IS NOT HIS MASK: EVEN LOGIC EVERYTHING IS AN EXCUSE FOR HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY; HIS “SELF” HAS INFESTED IDEAS HIS ANGUISH HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A CRITERION INTO THE SOLE REALITY.

FLAYED ALIVE
WHAT LIFE IS LEFT HIM ROBS HIM OF WHAT REASON IS LEFT HIM. TRIFLES OR SCOURGES—THE PASSING OF A FLY OR THE CRAMPS OF THE PLANET—HORRIFY HIM EQUALLY. WITH HIS NERVES ON FIRE HE WOULD LIKE THE EARTH TO BE MADE OF GLASS TO SHATTER IT TO SMITHEREENS; AND WITH WHAT THIRST HE WOULD FLING HIMSELF TOWARD THE STARS TO REDUCE THEM TO POWDER ONE BY ONE. . . . CRIME GLISTENS IN HIS EYEBALLS; HIS HANDS TIGHTEN IN VAIN TO STRANGLE. LIFE IS TRANSMITTED LIKE A LEPROSY: TOO MANY CREATURES FOR A SINGLE MURDERER. IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE MAN WHO CANNOT KILL HIMSELF TO SEEK REVENGE AGAINST WHATEVER ENJOYS EXISTING. AND FAILING HE MOPES LIKE A DAMNED SOUL INFURIATED BY IMPOSSIBLE DESTRUCTIONS. A DISCARDED SATAN HE WEEPS POUNDS HIS BREAST BOWS HIS HEAD; THE BLOOD HE WANTED TO SHED FAILS TO REDDEN HIS OWN CHEEKS WHOSE PALLOR REFLECTS HIS DISGUST WITH THAT SECRETION OF HOPES PRODUCED BY THE ADVANCING SPECIES. HIS GREAT DREAM WAS TO DESTROY THE DAYS OF CREATION .. . HE RENOUNCES HIS DREAM COLLAPSES INTO HIMSELF AND YIELDS TO THE ELEGY OF HIS OWN FAILURE: ANOTHER ORDER OF EXCESS IS THE RESULT. HIS SKIN BURNS: FEVER FILLS THE UNIVERSE; HIS BRAIN IS ON FIRE: THE AIR IS INFLAMMABLE. HIS ILLS FILL SIDEREAL SPACE; HIS GRIEFS MAKE THE POLES TREMBLE. AND WHATEVER IS ALLUSION TO EXISTENCE THE MOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BREATH OF LIFE WRINGS FROM HIM A CRY WHICH COMPROMISES THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE STARS.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
A MIND COMPELS US ONLY BY ITS INCOMPATIBILITIES BY THE TENSION OF ITS MOVEMENTS BY THE DIVORCE OF ITS OPINIONS FROM ITS INCLINATIONS. MARCUS AURELIUS ENGAGED ON REMOTE EXPEDITIONS TENDS MORE TOWARD THE IDEA OF DEATH THAN TOWARD THAT OF THE EMPIRE; JULIAN MADE EMPEROR REGRETS HIS CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE ENVIES THE SAGES AND WASTES HIS NIGHTS POLEMICIZING AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS; LUTHER WITH A VANDAL’S VITALITY SINKS AND MOPES IN THE OBSESSION OF SIN AND WITHOUT FINDING AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN HIS DELICACIES AND HIS CRUDITIES; ROUSSEAU WHO MISTAKES HIS INSTINCTS LIVES ONLY IN THE IDEA OF HIS SINCERITY; NIETZSCHE WHOSE ENTIRE OEUVRE IS NOTHING BUT A HYMN TO POWER DRAGS OUT A SICKLY EXISTENCE OF A POIGNANT MONOTONY. . . .

FOR A MIND MATTERS ONLY TO THE DEGREE THAT IT DECEIVES ITSELF AS TO WHAT IT WANTS WHAT IT LOVES OR WHAT IT HATES; BEING SEVERAL IT CANNOT CHOOSE ITSELF. A PESSIMISM WITHOUT RAPTURES AN AGITATOR OF HOPES WITHOUT BITTERNESS DESERVES ONLY SCORN. ONLY THE MAN WHO HAS NO REGARD FOR HIS PAST FOR PROPRIETY LOGIC OR CONSIDERATION IS WORTHY OF OUR ATTACHMENT: HOW CAN WE LOVE A CONQUEROR IF HE FAILS TO PLUNGE INTO EVENTS WITH A SUSPICION OF FAILURE OR A THINKER IF HE HAS NOT CONQUERED HIS INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION? MAN FALLEN BACK ON HIS FUTILITY IS NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH THE DESIRE TO HAVE A LIFE. .. . IF HE WERE TO HAVE ONE OR WERE NOT—WOULD CONCERN THE OTHERS. . . . APOSTLE OF HIS FLUCTUATIONS HE NO LONGER ENCUMBERS HIMSELF WITH AN IDEAL IDENTITY; HIS TEMPERAMENT CONSTITUTES HIS SOLE DOCTRINE AND THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT HIS SOLE KNOWLEDGE.

RESTORATION OF A CULT
HAVING ERODED MY QUALITY AS A MAN NOTHING IS ANY LONGER OF ANY VALUE. EVERYWHERE ALL I SEE ARE ANIMALS WITH AN IDEAL THAT HERD TOGETHER TO BLEAT THEIR HOPES. . . . EVEN THOSE WHO DID NOT LIVE TOGETHER ARE CONSTRAINED TO DO SO LIKE GHOSTS OR ELSE TO WHAT END HAVE WE CONCEIVED THE “COMMUNION” OF SAINTS? IN PURSUIT OF A TRUE SOLITARY I SCRUTINIZE THE AGES AND I FIND THERE AND ENVY THERE ONLY THE DEVIL. . . . REASON BANISHES HIM THE HEART CRAVES HIM. . . . SPIRIT OF LIES PRINCE OF DARKNESS THE EVIL ONE THE ENEMY—HOW SWEET IT IS TO MURMUR THE NAMES THAT FLAYED HIS SOLITUDE! AND HOW I CHERISH HIM SINCE HIS DAILY RELEGATION! IF ONLY I COULD RE-ESTABLISH HIM IN HIS PRIMAL STATE! I BELIEVE IN HIM WITH ALL MY INCAPACITY TO BELIEVE. HIS COMPANY IS NECESSARY TO ME: A LONELY BEING TENDS TOWARD THE LONELIEST BEING—TOWARD THE ONE. . . . I OWE IT TO MYSELF TO TEND TOWARD HIM: MY POWER TO ADMIRE—FEARING TO REMAIN UNEMPLOYED—COMPELS ME TO IT. BEHOLD ME CONFRONTING MY MODEL; ATTACHING MYSELF TO HIM I PUNISH MY SOLITUDE FOR NOT BEING TOTAL I FORGE OUT OF IT ANOTHER WHICH TRANSCENDS IT: IT IS MY WAY OF BEING HUMBLE. . . .

WE REPLACE GOD AS BEST WE CAN; FOR EVERY GOD IS GOOD PROVIDED HE PERPETUATES IN ETERNITY OUR DESIRE FOR A CRUCIAL SOLITUDE. . . .

WE TROGLODYTES
VALUES DO NOT ACCUMULATE: A GENERATION CONTRIBUTES SOMETHING NEW ONLY BY TRAMPLING ON WHAT WAS UNIQUE IN THE PRECEDING GENERATION. THIS IS EVEN MORE THE CASE IN THE SUCCESSION OF CENTURIES: THE RENAISSANCE COULD NOT “SAVE” THE DEPTH THE PHANTOMS THE GENRE OF SAVAGERY OF THE MIDDLE AGES; THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN ITS TURN PRESERVED ONLY THE SENSE OF THE UNIVERSAL FROM THE RENAISSANCE WITHOUT THE PATHOS WHICH MARKED ITS PHYSIOGNOMY. THE MODERN ILLUSION HAS PLUNGED MAN INTO THE SWOONS OF BECOMING: HE HAS LOST HIS FOOTING IN ETERNITY HIS “SUBSTANCE.” EVERY CONQUEST SPIRITUAL OR POLITICAL IMPLIES A LOSS; EVERY CONQUEST IS AN AFFIRMATION . . . BUT A MURDEROUS ONE. IN THE REALM OF ART—THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH WE CAN SPEAK OF THE LIFE OF THE MIND—AN “IDEAL” IS ESTABLISHED ONLY ON THE RUINS OF ITS PREDECESSOR: EACH TRUE ARTIST IS A TRAITOR TO HIS FOREBEARS. . . . THERE IS NO SUPERIORITY IN HISTORY: REPUBLIC-MONARCHY; ROMANTICISM-CLASSICISM; LIBERALISM-AUTOCRACY; NATURALISM-ABSTRACTION; IRRATIONALISM-INTELLECTUALISM—INSTITUTIONS LIKE CURRENTS OF THOUGHT AND FEELING ARE OF EQUAL WORTH. NO FORM OF MIND CAN ASSUME ANOTHER; WE ARE SOMETHING ONLY BY EXCLUSION: NO ONE CAN RECONCILE ORDER AND DISORDER ABSTRACTION AND IMMEDIACY IMPULSE AND FATALITY. THE PERIODS OF SYNTHESIS ARE NOT CREATIVE: THEY SUMMARIZE THE FERVOR OF THE OTHERS A CONFUSED CHAOTIC RÉSUMÉ—EVERY ECLECTICISM BEING AN INDICATION OF AN ENDING.

EVERY STEP FORWARD IS FOLLOWED BY A STEP BACK: THIS IS THE UNFRUITFUL OSCILLATION OF HISTORY—A STATIONARY . . . BECOMING. THAT MAN SHOULD HAVE LET HIMSELF BE DUPED BY THE MIRAGE OF PROGRESS IS WHAT RENDERS HIS CLAIMS TO SUBTLETY ABSURD. PROGRESS? PERHAPS WE CAN FIND IT IN HYGIENE. . . . BUT ANYWHERE ELSE? IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES? AFTER ALL NO MORE THAN DEADLY GLORIES. . . . WHO IN GOOD FAITH COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN THE STONE AGE AND THE AGE OF MODERN WEAPONS? AS CLOSE TO THE APE IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER WE SCALE THE CLOUDS FOR THE SAME REASONS WE SHINNIED UP TREES: THE MEANS OF OUR CURIOSITY PURE OR CRIMINAL ARE ALL THAT HAVE CHANGED AND—WITH DISGUISED REFLEXES—WE ARE MORE DIVERSELY RAPACIOUS. A MERE WHIM TO ACCEPT OR REJECT A PERIOD: WE MUST ACCEPT OR REJECT HISTORY EN BLOC. THE NOTION OF PROGRESS MAKES US ALL DOLTS ON THE PINNACLES OF TIME; BUT THESE PINNACLES DO NOT EXIST: THE TROGLODYTE WHO TREMBLED WITH FEAR IN THE CAVES STILL TREMBLES IN THE SKYSCRAPERS. OUR CAPITAL OF MISERY REMAINS INTACT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES; YET WE HAVE ONE ADVANTAGE OVER OUR ANCESTORS: THAT OF HAVING INVESTED OUR CAPITAL BETTER SINCE OUR DISASTER IS BETTER ORGANIZED.

PHYSIOGNOMY OF A FAILURE
MONSTROUS DREAMS INHABIT GROCERIES AND CHURCHES: I HAVE COME ACROSS NO ONE WHO DID NOT LIVE IN DELIRIUM. SINCE THE MEREST DESIRE CONCEALS A SOURCE OF INSANITY IT IS ENOUGH TO CONFORM TO THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION TO DESERVE THE ASYLUM. LIFE—A FIT OF LUNACY THROTTLING MATTER. .. . I BREATHE: ENOUGH TO BE PUT AWAY. . . . INCAPABLE OF ATTAINING TO THE LUCIDITIES OF DEATH I CRAWL IN THE SHADOW OF THE DAYS AND I YET AM ONLY BY THE WILL NO LONGER TO BE. . . .

ONCE I THOUGHT I COULD CRUSH SPACE WITH A BLOW OF MY FIST PLAY WITH THE STARS HALT TIME OR WIELD IT ACCORDING TO MY WHIM. THE GREAT CAPTAINS SEEMED TO ME THE GREAT COWARDS THE POETS WRETCHED STAMMERERS; NOT KNOWING THE RESISTANCE THINGS MEN AND WORDS OFFER US AND SUPPOSING I FELT MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE ALLOWED I GAVE MYSELF UP TO A SUSPECT INFINITY TO A COSMOGONY RESULTING FROM A PUBERTY UNFIT TO END ITSELF. . . . HOW EASY IT IS TO BELIEVE YOURSELF A GOD BY THE HEART AND HOW HARD IT IS TO BE ONE BY THE MIND! AND WITH HOW MANY ILLUSIONS MUST I HAVE BEEN BORN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LOSE ONE EVERY DAY! LIFE IS A MIRACLE BITTERNESS DESTROYS.

THE INTERVAL SEPARATING ME FROM MY CORPSE IS A WOUND; YET I ASPIRE IN VAIN TO THE SEDUCTIONS OF THE GRAVE: UNABLE TO RID MYSELF OF ANYTHING TO CEASE BREATHING EITHER EVERYTHING IN ME SUGGESTS THAT THE WORMS WILL BE OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY GET TO MY INSTINCTS AS INCOMPETENT IN LIFE AS IN DEATH I LOATHE MYSELF AND IN THIS LOATHING I DREAM OF ANOTHER LIFE ANOTHER DEATH. AND FOR HAVING SOUGHT TO BE A SAGE SUCH AS NEVER WAS I AM ONLY A MADMAN AMONG THE MAD. . . .

PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN
COMMITTED BEYOND HIS MEANS BEYOND HIS INSTINCTS MAN HAS ENDED UP IN AN IMPASSE. HE HAS BURNED HIS BRIDGES . . . TO CATCH UP WITH HIS CONCLUSION; ANIMAL WITHOUT A FUTURE HE HAS FOUNDERED IN HIS IDEAL HE HAS WORSTED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN GAME. HAVING CEASELESSLY SOUGHT TO TRANSCEND HIMSELF HE IS PARALYZED; AND HIS ONLY REMAINING RESOURCE IS TO RECAPITULATE HIS FOLLIES TO EXPIATE THEM AND TO COMMIT A FEW MORE. . . .

YET THERE ARE SOME TO WHOM EVEN THIS RESOURCE REMAINS FORBIDDEN: “UNACCUSTOMED TO BEING MEN” THEY MURMUR “DO WE STILL BELONG TO A TRIBE A RACE A BREED? SO LONG AS WE HAD THE PREJUDICE OF LIFE WE ESPOUSED AN ERROR WHICH KEPT US ON A FOOTING WITH THE OTHERS. . . . BUT WE HAVE ESCAPED THE RACE. . . . OUR LUCIDITY CRUMBLING OUR SKELETON HAS REDUCED US TO A LIMP EXISTENCE—INVERTEBRATE RABBLE STRETCHING OUT ON MATTER TO CORRUPT IT WITH SLOBBER. BEHOLD US AMONG THE SLIME BEHOLD US AT THAT LAUGHABLE END WHERE WE PAY FOR HAVING MISUSED OUR FACULTIES AND OUR DREAMS. . . . LIFE WAS NOT OUR LOT: AT THE VERY MOMENTS WHEN WE WERE DRUNK WITH LIFE ALL OUR JOYS CAME FROM OUR TRANSPORTS ABOVE IT; TAKING REVENGE LIFE LUGS US TOWARD ITS LOWER DEPTHS: PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN TOWARD A SUB-LIFE. . . ”

QUOUSQUE EADEM?
FOREVER BE ACCURSED THE STAR UNDER WHICH I WAS BORN MAY NO SKY PROTECT IT LET IT CRUMBLE IN SPACE LIKE A DUST WITHOUT HONOR! AND LET THE TRAITOROUS MOMENT THAT CAST ME AMONG THE CREATURES BE FOREVER ERASED FROM THE LISTS OF TIME! MY DESIRES CAN NO LONGER DEAL WITH THIS MIXTURE OF LIFE AND DEATH IN WHICH ETERNITY DAILY ROTS. WEARY OF THE FUTURE I HAVE TRAVERSED ITS DAYS AND YET I AM TORMENTED BY THE INTEMPERANCE OF UNKNOWN THIRSTS. LIKE A FRENZIED SAGE DEAD TO THE WORLD AND FRANTIC AGAINST IT I INVALIDATE MY ILLUSIONS ONLY TO IRRITATE THEM THE MORE. THIS EXASPERATION IN AN UNFORESEEABLE UNIVERSE— WHERE NONETHELESS EVERYTHING REPEATS ITSELF—WILL IT NEVER COME TO AN END? HOW LONG MUST I KEEP TELLING MYSELF: “I LOATHE THIS LIFE I IDOLIZE?” THE NULLITY OF OUR DELIRIUMS MAKES US ALL SO MANY GODS SUBJECT TO AN INSIPID FATALITY. WHY REBEL ANY LONGER AGAINST THE SYMMETRY OF THIS WORLD WHEN CHAOS ITSELF CAN ONLY BE A SYSTEM OF DISORDERS? OUR FATE BEING TO ROT WITH THE CONTINENTS AND THE STARS WE DRAG ON LIKE RESIGNED SICK MEN AND TO THE END OF TIME THE CURIOSITY OF A DENOUEMENT THAT IS FORESEEN FRIGHTFUL AND VAIN.

TO THOSE WHO LOVED SARTRE
WHO DO LOVE HIM
WHO WILL LOVE HIM

THIS IS THE FIRST OF MY BOOKS—THE ONLY ONE NO DOUBT—THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE READ BEFORE IT IS PRINTED. IT IS WHOLLY AND ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOU; AND YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED BY IT.

WHEN WE WERE YOUNG AND ONE OF US GAINED A BRILLIANT VICTORY OVER THE OTHER IN AN IMPASSIONED ARGUMENT THE WINNER USED TO SAY “THERE YOU ARE IN YOUR LITTLE BOX!” YOU ARE IN YOUR LITTLE BOX; YOU WILL NOT COME OUT OF IT AND I SHALL NOT JOIN YOU THERE. EVEN IF I AM BURIED NEXT TO YOU THERE WILL BE NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOUR ASHES AND MINE.

WHEN I SAY YOU IT IS ONLY A PRETENSE A RHETORICAL DEVICE. NO ONE HEARS IT. I AM SPEAKING TO NO ONE. IN REALITY IT IS SARTRE’S FRIENDS THAT I AM TALKING TO—THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LAST YEARS. I HAVE DESCRIBED THEM AS I LIVED THROUGH THEM. I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT MYSELF A LITTLE BECAUSE THE WITNESS IS PART OF HIS EVIDENCE BUT I HAVE DONE SO AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE. IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT AND THEN BECAUSE AS I REPLIED TO A FRIEND WHO ASKED ME HOW I WAS TAKING IT “THESE THINGS CANNOT BE TOLD; THEY CANNOT BE PUT INTO WRITING; THEY CANNOT BE FORMED IN ONE’S MIND. THEY ARE EXPERIENCED AND THAT IS ALL.”

THIS NARRATIVE IS CHIEFLY BASED ON THE DIARY I KEPT DURING THOSE TEN YEARS AND ON THE MANY TESTIMONIES I HAVE GATHERED. MY THANKS TO ALL THOSE WHOSE WRITTEN OR SPOKEN WORDS HAVE HELPED ME TO RECOUNT SARTRE’S LAST DAYS.

1970
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE SARTRE NEVER CEASED CALLING HIMSELF INTO QUESTION; HE DID NOT UNDERESTIMATE WHAT HE CALLED HIS “IDEOLOGICAL INTERESTS” BUT HE DID NOT WISH TO BE WHOLLY TAKEN OVER BY THEM. HE OFTEN THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO “THINK AGAINST HIMSELF” TRYING HARD TO “BREAK BONES INSIDE HIS HEAD.” THE POLITICAL UPHEAVALS OF 1968 IN WHICH HE WAS INVOLVED AND WHICH AFFECTED HIM DEEPLY LED HIM TO REFLECT UPON THE INTELLECTUAL’S ROLE AND TO MODIFY HIS CONCEPTION OF IT.

HE OFTEN EXPLAINED HIS VIEWS ON THIS POINT. UP UNTIL THAT TIME SARTRE HAD SEEN THE INTELLECTUAL AS SOMEONE WHO WAS TORMENTED BY THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSALITY OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF THE RULING CLASS WHICH HAD PRODUCED HIM—HE WAS THUS THE INCARNATION OF THE GUILTY CONSCIENCE AS HEGEL DEFINES IT AND SOOTHING HIS CONSCIENCE BY HIS VERY AWARENESS OF ITS GUILT HE FELT THAT IT ALLOWED HIM TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE PROLETARIAT. SARTRE NOW THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO BEYOND THAT STAGE. AGAINST THE CLASSIC INTELLECTUAL HE SET UP THE NEW INTELLECTUAL WHO ENDEAVORS TO BECOME INTEGRATED WITH THE MASSES SO AS TO BRING ABOUT THE TRIUMPH OF TRUE UNIVERSALITY.

SARTRE TRIED TO FOLLOW THIS LINE OF CONDUCT EVEN BEFORE HE HAD DISTINCTLY FORMULATED IT. IN THE FALL OF 1968 HE UNDERTOOK THE EDITING OF INTERLUTTES A BULLETIN THAT CIRCULATED AMONG THE POLITICAL ACTIVISTS. HE HAD MET GEISMAR SEVERAL TIMES AND WAS KEENLY INTERESTED IN HIS IDEA OF PUBLISHING A PAPER IN WHICH THE MASSES COULD SPEAK. IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE HOWEVER WHEN GEISMAR JOINED THE GAUCHE PROLÉTARIENNE (G. P.) AND HE AND THE MAOISTS BROUGHT OUT LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE. IT HAD NO OWNER WAS WRITTEN DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE WORKERS AND WAS SOLD ON THE STREETS BY THE MILITANTS. ITS AIM WAS TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE STRUGGLES CARRIED ON BY THE WORKING CLASS IN FRANCE FROM 1970 ONWARD. IT WAS OFTEN HOSTILE TO THE INTELLECTUALS AND WHERE ROLAND CASTRO’S TRIAL WAS CONCERNED TO SARTRE HIMSELF.*

AFTER CERTAIN ARTICLES IN LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE VIOLENTLY ATTACKED THE GOVERNMENT ITS FIRST TWO EDITORS WERE ARRESTED. GEISMAR AND OTHER MILITANTS SUGGESTED THAT SARTRE SHOULD TAKE THEIR PLACE. HE AGREED WITHOUT HESITATION BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT THE WEIGHT OF HIS NAME MIGHT BE USEFUL TO THE MAOISTS. “I CYNICALLY TIPPED THE SCALES WITH THE FACT THAT I WAS WELL KNOWN” HE SAID LATER DURING A LECTURE IN BRUSSELS. FROM THAT POINT ON THE MAOISTS WERE PERSUADED TO REVISE THEIR OPINION OF THE INTELLECTUALS AND THEIR TACTICS TOWARD THEM.

THE FIRST ISSUE OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE EDITED BY SARTRE CAME OUT ON MAY 1 1970. THE AUTHORITIES DID NOT ATTACK HIM BUT THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR ORDERED THE SEIZURE OF EACH NUMBER AT THE PRINTING PLANT. FORTUNATELY THE PRINTER MANAGED TO GET MOST OF THE COPIES OUT AND AWAY BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN. THE GOVERNMENT THEN WENT AFTER THE VENDORS OF THE PAPER WHO WERE BROUGHT BEFORE A SPECIAL COURT AND CHARGED WITH RECONSTITUTING AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAD BEEN BANNED. HOWEVER SARTRE AND I AND SEVERAL FRIENDS SOLD THE PAPER IN THE HEART OF PARIS WITHOUT BEING SERIOUSLY DISTURBED. ONE DAY THE AUTHORITIES GREW TIRED OF THE POINTLESS STRUGGLE AND IT BEGAN TO BE SOLD IN THE KIOSKS. AN ASSOCIATION OF “FRIENDS OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE” WAS FORMED WITH MICHEL LEIRIS AND MYSELF AT THE HEAD OF IT. ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TO BE DECLARED AND AN OFFICIAL RECEIPT IS DELIVERED. THIS WAS AT FIRST REFUSED TO US AND WE HAD TO APPEAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT TO GET IT.

IN JUNE 1970 SARTRE HELPED TO FOUND THE SECOURS ROUGE AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE AIM WAS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION. THE NATIONAL STEERING COMMITTEE IN A DECLARATION LARGELY WRITTEN BY SARTRE STATED AMONG OTHER THINGS:

SECOURS ROUGE WILL BE A DEMOCRATIC LEGALLY DECLARED AND INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION ITS ESSENTIAL AIM WILL BE TO ENSURE THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL DEFENSE OF THE VICTIMS OF REPRESSION AND TO PROVIDE THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH MATERIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT NO ONE BEING BARRED …

… JUSTICE AND FREEDOM CANNOT BE DEFENDED WITHOUT ORGANIZING SOLIDARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE. SECOURS ROUGE WHICH ARISES FROM THE PEOPLE WILL HELP THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE.

THE ORGANIZATION INCLUDED THE MAIN LEFTIST GROUPS TÉMOIGNAGE CHRÉTIEN AND A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE. ITS CHIEF PURPOSE WAS TO RESIST THE WAVE OF ARRESTS INITIATED BY MARCELLIN AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE G.P. A GREAT MANY MILITANTS WERE IN PRISON. WHAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON THEIR CASES AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE. SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE BELONGED TO SECOURS ROUGE AND PRIMARY COMMITTEES WERE SET UP IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS IN PARIS AND IN THE PROVINCES. THE LYONS COMMITTEE WAS THE MOST ACTIVE OF THOSE IN THE DEPARTMENTS. IN PARIS THE ORGANIZATION WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS. ALTHOUGH GENERALLY SPEAKING THE COMMITTEES WERE POLITICALLY ECLECTIC IT WAS THE MAOISTS WHO WERE THE MOST ACTIVE AND WHO MORE OR LESS TOOK THEM OVER.

ALTHOUGH SARTRE ZEALOUSLY CARRIED OUT HIS TASKS AS A MILITANT HE STILL SPENT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME ON HIS LITERARY WORK. HE WAS FINISHING THE THIRD VOLUME OF HIS GREAT BOOK ON FLAUBERT. IN 1954 ROGER GARAUDY HAD SAID TO HIM “LET US BOTH WORK ON ONE AND THE SAME CHARACTER WITH ME EXPLAINING HIM ACCORDING TO MARXIST AND YOU ACCORDING TO EXISTENTIALIST METHODS.” SARTRE CHOSE FLAUBERT WHOM HE HAD TREATED VERY HARSHLY IN WHAT IS LITERATURE? BUT WHO HAD QUITE WON HIM OVER WHEN HE READ HIS CORRESPONDENCE. WHAT HE FOUND MOST ATTRACTIVE IN FLAUBERT WAS HIS EXALTATION OF THE IMAGINARY ABOVE ALL OTHER FACTORS. AT THAT TIME SARTRE FILLED ABOUT TEN LARGE NOTEBOOKS; THEN HE WROTE A THOUSAND-PAGE ESSAY WHICH HE ABANDONED IN 1955. HE WENT BACK TO WORK COMPLETELY RECASTING THE BOOK BETWEEN 1968 AND 1970. HE CALLED IT THE FAMILY IDIOT AND HE WROTE IT BOTH EAGERLY AND EASILY. “IT WAS A QUESTION OF SHOWING A METHOD AND AT THE SAME TIME OF SHOWING A MAN.”

HE EXPLAINED HIS AIMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. IT WAS NOT A SCIENTIFIC WORK THAT HE WAS CONCERNED WITH SINCE HE DID NOT MAKE USE OF CONCEPTS BUT RATHER OF NOTIONS A NOTION BEING A THOUGHT THAT INCLUDES THE FACTOR OF TIME—THE NOTION OF PASSIVITY FOR EXAMPLE. WITH REGARD TO FLAUBERT HE ADOPTED AN ATTITUDE OF EMPATHY. “TO PROVE THAT ANY MAN IS PERFECTLY KNOWABLE SO LONG AS ONE USES THE RIGHT METHOD AND POSSESSES THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS—THAT IS MY GOAL.” HE ALSO SAID “WHEN I POINT OUT HOW FLAUBERT DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF AND HOW AT THE SAME TIME HE UNDERSTANDS HIMSELF VERY WELL INDEED I AM SHOWING WHAT I CALL THE EXPERIENCED THE LIVED-THROUGH ASPECT: THAT IS LIFE LIVED IN UNDERSTANDING WITH ONESELF WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE ANY POSITIVELY STATED AWARENESS BEING EVIDENT.”

HIS MAOIST FRIENDS WERE MORE OR LESS OPPOSED TO THIS UNDERTAKING. THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SARTRE TO WRITE SOME MILITANT TREATISE OR A GREAT NOVEL DESIGNED FOR THE PEOPLE. BUT ON THIS POINT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF YIELDING TO ANY PRESSURE WHATSOEVER. HE UNDERSTOOD HIS COMRADES’ POINT OF VIEW BUT HE DID NOT SHARE IT. “IF I LOOK AT THE SUBJECT MATTER” HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE FAMILY IDIOT “I HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF AN ESCAPE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND I LOOK AT THE METHOD I HAVE A FEELING OF BEING HERE IN THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT.”

LATER HE RETURNED TO THE QUESTION IN A LECTURE HE GAVE IN BRUSSELS. “FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN HARNESSED TO A WORK ON FLAUBERT A BOOK THAT COULD NOT INTEREST THE WORKERS BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN IN A COMPLICATED AND CERTAINLY BOURGEOIS STYLE.… I AM BOUND TO IT. THAT IS I AM SIXTY-SEVEN I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT SINCE I WAS FIFTY AND I USED TO DREAM ABOUT IT BEFORE THAT.… INSOFAR AS I AM WRITING ABOUT FLAUBERT I AM AN ENFANT TERRIBLE BELONGING TO THE BOURGEOISIE A SUBJECT FOR RECLAMATION.”

HIS BASIC IDEA WAS THAT AT NO MATTER WHAT POINT IN HISTORY AND WHATEVER THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT IT WAS STILL ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE AND THAT HIS STUDY OF FLAUBERT MIGHT BE OF USE TO THAT END.

SARTRE WAS THEREFORE QUITE SATISFIED WITH HIS VARIOUS COMMITMENTS WHEN WE RETURNED TO PARIS IN SEPTEMBER 1970 AFTER A HAPPY STAY IN ROME. HE LIVED IN AN AUSTERE LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE TENTH FLOOR OF A BUILDING IN THE BOULEVARD RASPAIL OPPOSITE THE MONTPARNASSE GRAVEYARD AND QUITE CLOSE TO MY PLACE. HE LIKED IT THERE. HE LED A FAIRLY EVEN LIFE THAT VARIED LITTLE FROM DAY TO DAY. HE REGULARLY SAW LONG-ESTABLISHED WOMEN FRIENDS—WANDA K. MICHÈLE VIAN AND HIS ADOPTED DAUGHTER ARLETTE ELKAÏM AT WHOSE HOME HE SLEPT TWO NIGHTS A WEEK. THE OTHER EVENINGS HE SPENT WITH ME. WE TALKED AND WE LISTENED TO MUSIC. I HAD BUILT UP A LARGE COLLECTION OF RECORDS AND I ADDED TO IT EVERY MONTH. SARTRE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE VIENNESE SCHOOL PARTICULARLY BERG AND WEBERN AND IN SOME MODERN COMPOSERS: STOCKHAUSEN XENAKIS BERIO AND PENDERECKI AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS. BUT HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY TO GO BACK TO THE GREAT CLASSICS. HE LOVED MONTEVERDI GESUALDO MOZART’S OPERAS—ABOVE ALL COSÍ FAN TUTTE—AND VERDI’S. DURING THESE HOME CONCERTS WE WOULD EAT A HARD-BOILED EGG OR A SLICE OF HAM AND DRINK A LITTLE SCOTCH. I LIVE IN WHAT REAL ESTATE AGENTS CALL “AN ARTIST’S STUDIO WITH LOGGIA.” I SPEND MY DAYS IN A BIG HIGH-CEILINGED ROOM; AN INSIDE STAIRCASE LEADS TO A BEDROOM WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE BATHROOM BY A KIND OF BALCONY. SARTRE SLEPT UPSTAIRS AND CAME DOWN IN THE MORNING TO HAVE TEA WITH ME. SOMETIMES ONE OF HIS FRIENDS LILIANE SIEGEL WOULD COME AND TAKE HIM OUT FOR COFFEE AT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR HIS BUILDING. HE FREQUENTLY SAW BOST AT MY APARTMENT IN THE EVENING AND QUITE OFTEN LANZMANN WITH WHOM HE HAD MANY TIES IN SPITE OF CERTAIN DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN QUESTION. HE WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF SATURDAY EVENINGS WHICH SYLVIE† SPENT WITH US AND OF LUNCHTIME ON SUNDAY WHEN WE ALL THREE MET AT LA COUPOLE. AT LONG INTERVALS WE ALSO MET OTHER FRIENDS.

IN THE AFTERNOONS I WORKED AT SARTRE’S PLACE. I WAS WAITING FOR OLD AGE TO COME OUT AND THINKING ABOUT ONE LAST VOLUME OF MY MEMOIRS. HE WAS REVISING AND CORRECTING HIS PORTRAIT OF DR. FLAUBERT IN THE FAMILY IDIOT. IT WAS A SPLENDID AUTUMN BLUE AND GOLD. THE OPENING YEAR PROMISED VERY WELL.‡

IN SEPTEMBER SARTRE TOOK PART IN A GREAT MEETING ORGANIZED BY SECOURS ROUGE TO DENOUNCE KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN’S MASSACRE OF PALESTINIANS. SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE PRESENT INCLUDING JEAN GENET WHOM SARTRE HAD NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE. GENET WAS CONNECTED WITH THE BLACK PANTHERS AND HAD WRITTEN AN ARTICLE ABOUT THEM IN LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. HE WAS GETTING READY TO LEAVE FOR JORDAN WHERE HE WANTED TO STAY IN A PALESTINIAN CAMP.

SARTRE’S HEALTH NO LONGER WORRIED ME AND HAD NOT FOR A GREAT WHILE NOW. ALTHOUGH HE SMOKED TWO PACKS OF BOYARDS A DAY HIS ARTERITIS HAD NOT GROWN WORSE. IT WAS SUDDENLY TOWARD THE END OF SEPTEMBER THAT I BEGAN TO BE FRIGHTENED.

ONE SATURDAY EVENING WE HAD DINNER WITH SYLVIE AT DOMINIQUE’S AND SARTRE DRANK A GREAT DEAL OF VODKA. BACK AT MY STUDIO HE FIRST DOZED AND THEN FELL FAST ASLEEP DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE. WE HELPED HIM UP TO HIS BEDROOM. THE NEXT MORNING HE SEEMED TO BE PERFECTLY WELL AND WENT BACK TO HIS OWN APARTMENT. BUT WHEN AT TWO O’CLOCK SYLVIE AND I WENT TO FETCH HIM FOR LUNCH HE BUMPED INTO THE FURNITURE AT EVERY STEP. WHEN WE LEFT LA COUPOLE HE WAS STAGGERING ALTHOUGH HE HAD DRUNK VERY LITTLE. WE TOOK HIM TO WANDA’S PLACE IN THE RUE DU DRAGON IN A TAXI AND AS HE GOT OUT HE NEARLY FELL.

HE HAD HAD FITS OF GIDDINESS BEFORE THIS. WHEN WE WERE IN ROME IN 1968 HIS LEGS GAVE WAY WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR IN THE PIAZZA SANTA MARIA DEI TRASTEVERE TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SYLVIE AND I HAD TO SUPPORT HIM. I DID NOT THINK IT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE BUT I WAS SURPRISED SINCE HE HAD DRUNK NOTHING! YET THESE DISTURBANCES HAD NEVER BEEN SO MARKED AS THEY WERE NOW AND I HAD A SUSPICION OF THEIR GRAVITY. IN MY DIARY I WROTE “THIS LITTLE APARTMENT SO CHEERFUL SINCE I CAME BACK HAS CHANGED ITS COLOR. THE PRETTY VELVET-PILED CARPET BRINGS MOURNING TO MIND. THAT IS HOW LIFE WILL HAVE TO BE: WITH HAPPINESS AND MOMENTS OF DELIGHT WHEN ALL GOES WELL BUT WITH THE THREAT HANGING THERE—LIFE SET BETWEEN PARENTHESES.”

AS I COPY OUT THESE LINES I AM FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT: HOW DID I COME TO HAVE THAT DARK FOREBODING? I THINK THAT IN SPITE OF MY APPARENT CALMNESS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAD NEVER REALLY STOPPED BEING ON THE WATCH. THE FIRST ALARM WAS THE ATTACK OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE THAT HAD TAKEN SARTRE TO THE HOSPITAL JUST AFTER HIS JOURNEY TO THE USSR IN THE SUMMER OF 1954. THEN IN THE FALL OF 1958 I WAS EXTREMELY ANXIOUS.§ SARTRE ONLY JUST ESCAPED A STROKE. SINCE THAT TIME THE THREAT WAS ALWAYS THERE; THE DOCTORS HAD TOLD ME THAT HIS ARTERIES AND ARTERIOLES WERE TOO NARROW. EVERY MORNING WHEN I WENT TO WAKE HIM I WAS IMPATIENT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS BREATHING. I WAS NOT REALLY WORRIED; IT WAS MORE AN EFFECT OF THE IMAGINATION BUT IT WAS ONE THAT MEANT SOMETHING. THESE FRESH DISTURBANCES COMPELLED ME TO BECOME FULLY AND TRAGICALLY AWARE OF A FRAILTY THAT IN FACT I HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF ALL THE TIME.

THE NEXT DAY SARTRE HAD PRETTY WELL RECOVERED HIS BALANCE AND HE WENT TO SEE HIS USUAL PHYSICIAN DR. ZAIDMANN. HE SAID THAT TESTS WOULD BE NECESSARY AND HE ADVISED SARTRE NOT TO TIRE HIMSELF BEFORE HE SAW A SPECIALIST ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY. THE SPECIALIST DR. LEBEAU WOULD NOT BE CATEGORICAL. THE LACK OF BALANCE MIGHT BE CAUSED BY TROUBLE IN THE INNER EAR OR IN THE BRAIN. HE CALLED FOR AN ENCEPHALOGRAM BUT IT SHOWED NOTHING ABNORMAL.

SARTRE WAS OUT OF SORTS. HE HAD AN ABSCESS IN HIS MOUTH AND HE FELT THE BEGINNINGS OF FLU. BUT IT WAS WITH JOY AND DELIGHT THAT HE DELIVERED THE HUGE MANUSCRIPT OF FLAUBERT TO GALLIMARD ON OCTOBER 8.

THE MAOISTS HAD ORGANIZED A JOURNEY THAT WOULD TAKE HIM TO FOSSUR-MER AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL CENTERS SO HE COULD STUDY THE WORKERS’ LIVING CONDITIONS AND THE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. ON OCTOBER 15 THE DOCTORS FORBADE HIM TO GO. IN ADDITION TO ZAIDMANN HE HAD SEEN SPECIALISTS WHO HAD EXAMINED HIS EYES EARS SKULL AND BRAIN—NO LESS THAN ELEVEN CONSULTATIONS. THEY HAD DETECTED GRAVE DISTURBANCES IN THE CIRCULATION IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE OF HIS BRAIN (THE HEMISPHERE THAT HAS TO DO WITH SPEECH) AND A NARROWING OF THE BLOOD VESSELS. HE WAS TO SMOKE LESS AND TO UNDERGO A SERIES OF DRASTIC INJECTIONS. IN TWO MONTHS THEY WOULD TAKE ANOTHER ENCEPHALOGRAM. BY THAT TIME HE WOULD NO DOUBT BE CURED. BUT HE WAS NOT TO OVERDO THINGS ABOVE ALL PHYSICALLY. IN FACT NOW THAT THE FLAUBERT WAS FINISHED THERE WAS NO REASON SARTRE SHOULD TIRE HIMSELF. HE READ MANUSCRIPTS AND DETECTIVE STORIES AND HE DREAMED VAGUELY OF WRITING A PLAY. IN THE COURSE OF THAT OCTOBER HE ALSO WROTE A PREFACE FOR THE CATALOG OF REBEYROLLE’S EXHIBIT A SHOW THAT REBEYROLLE CALLED COEXISTENCES. WE WERE VERY FOND OF HIS PAINTING. HE HAD COME TO SPEND TWO DAYS WITH US IN ROME AND WE HAD THE GREATEST LIKING FOR HIM. WHEN WE MET HIS WIFE A LIVELY AMUSING LITTLE ARMENIAN WE HAD THE SAME FEELING FOR HER. WE SAW THEM QUITE OFTEN IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED. THEY WERE FRIENDS OF FRANQUI THE JOURNALIST WHO HAD INVITED US TO CUBA IN 1960 AND WHO HAD LATER GONE INTO EXILE BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO CASTRO’S PRO-SOVIET POLICY.

IN SPITE OF THE TROUBLE WITH HIS HEALTH SARTRE CARRIED ON HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT THE POLICE RAIDED THE PLANT OF SIMON BLUMENTHAL THE PRINTER OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE.

ON OCTOBER 21 GEISMAR WAS TRIED. AT THE RALLY TO PROTEST THE ARREST OF THE EDITORS LE DANTEC AND LE BRIS FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD SHOUTED “ALL OUT INTO THE STREET ON THE TWENTY-SEVENTH!” SEVERAL SPEAKERS HAD ADDRESSED THE CROWD BUT ONLY GEISMAR HAD BEEN ARRESTED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE HE BELONGED TO THE G.P. FURTHERMORE THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE TWENTY-SEVENTH CAUSED NO BLOODSHED—THE C.R.S. HAD USED TEAR GAS AND THE DEMONSTRATORS HAD THROWN A FEW BOLTS BUT NO ONE HAD BEEN HURT. YET FOR ALL THAT A SEVERE SENTENCE WAS EXPECTED. SARTRE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO GIVE EVIDENCE. BUT RATHER THAN PLAY THE CONVENTIONAL PART BEFORE A COURT OF BOURGEOIS JUSTICE HE PREFERRED TO GO AND TALK TO THE WORKERS AT BILLANCOURT. MANAGEMENT WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM INTO THE WORKS AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD HAD A TRACT HANDED OUT AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING TO WARN THE RENAULT WORKERS AGAINST HIM. PERCHED ON A BARREL AND USING A MEGAPHONE HE SPOKE OUTSIDE ADDRESSING A RATHER LIMITED AUDIENCE. “IT IS FOR YOU TO SAY WHETHER GEISMAR’S ACTION IS RIGHT OR WRONG” HE SAID. “WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO BEAR WITNESS IN THE STREET BECAUSE I AM AN INTELLECTUAL AND BECAUSE I THINK THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE INTELLECTUALS THAT EXISTED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY—IT DIDN’T ALWAYS EXIST BUT WHEN IT DID IT GOT VERY GOOD RESULTS—SHOULD BE REVIVED TODAY. FOR FIFTY YEARS THE PEOPLE AND THE INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN SEPARATED. NOW THEY MUST BE REUNITED—NOW THEY MUST MAKE ONE SINGLE BODY.”

SARTRE’S OPPONENTS DID THEIR BEST TO MAKE FUN OF HIS INTERVENTION. THE COMMUNISTS RETORTED THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE INTELLECTUALS WAS ENSURED BECAUSE A GREAT MANY INTELLECTUALS WERE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY. MEANWHILE GEISMAR WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IMPRISONMENT.

SARTRE SHARED IN THE SETTING UP OF A NEW PAPER J’ACCUSE WHOSE FIRST NUMBER CAME OUT ON NOVEMBER 1. THE TEAM WHO RAN IT—LINHART GLUCKSMANN MICHÈLE MANCEAUX FROMANGER AND GODARD AMONG THEM—WERE ALL FRIENDS OF HIS. THE PAPER WAS NOT WRITTEN BY MILITANTS BUT BY INTELLECTUALS. SARTRE WROTE A FEW ARTICLES FOR IT. ONLY TWO MORE NUMBERS CAME OUT AFTER THE FIRST: ONE APPEARED ON JANUARY 15 1971 THE OTHER ON MARCH 15. LILIANE SIEGEL UNDER HER MAIDEN NAME OF SENDYK WAS THE EDITOR LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PUBLICATION. SHE KEPT THE POSITION WHEN J’ACCUSE MERGED AND BECAME LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE—J’ACCUSE. SINCE THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WISH TO ARREST SARTRE IT WAS SHE WHO TWICE APPEARED IN THE DOCK WITH SARTRE GIVING EVIDENCE IN HER FAVOR.

YET HIS HEALTH CONTINUED TO WORRY ME. WHEN HE WAS BORED—AND HE FORCED HIMSELF TO DO A GOOD MANY WEARISOME TASKS—HE DRANK TOO MUCH. IN THE EVENING AND EVEN DURING THE DAY HE WAS OFTEN DROWSY. DR. LEBEAU WHOM HE CONSULTED ON NOVEMBER 5 SAID THAT THIS SLEEPINESS WAS CAUSED BY THE MEDICINES PRESCRIBED FOR HIS DIZZINESS AND HE REDUCED THE DOSES. ON NOVEMBER 22 ANOTHER ENCEPHALOGRAM WAS TAKEN AND IT WAS ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY; SHORTLY AFTERWARD DR. LEBEAU ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY CURED AND THAT HE WAS NO MORE THREATENED WITH VERTIGO THAN ANYONE ELSE. THIS PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH BUT ONE OTHER ANXIETY STILL REMAINED—HIS TEETH. HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A PLATE MADE AND HE DREADED IT FOR OBVIOUS SYMBOLIC REASONS AND BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC. AS THINGS TURNED OUT HOWEVER THE DENTIST DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AND SARTRE’S MIND WAS SET AT EASE.

HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE PUBLICATION OF CONTAT’S AND RYBALKO’S BOOK THE WRITINGS OF JEAN-PAUL SARTRE. HE CORRECTED THE PROOFS OF THE FAMILY IDIOT. HE WAS ON THE TOP OF HIS FORM IN DECEMBER WHEN HE PRESIDED OVER THE COAL MINES TRIAL.

I DESCRIBED THIS TRIAL IN ALL SAID AND DONE BUT SINCE SARTRE ATTACHED A GREAT DEAL OF IMPORTANCE TO IT I SHOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT HERE. IN FEBRUARY 1970 SIXTEEN MINERS WERE KILLED AND MANY OTHERS WOUNDED BY A FIREDAMP EXPLOSION AT HÉNIN-LIÉTARD. SINCE THE HOUILLÈRES THE STATE-OWNED COAL MINES WERE OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE SOME UNIDENTIFIED YOUNG MEN THREW MOLOTOV COCKTAILS INTO THE OFFICES OF THE MANAGEMENT IN RETALIATION CAUSING A FIRE. WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF PROOF THE POLICE ARRESTED FOUR MAOISTS AND TWO FORMER CONVICTS. THEY WERE TO BE TRIED ON MONDAY DECEMBER 14 AND SECOURS ROUGE SUMMONED A PEOPLE’S COURT FOR SATURDAY THE TWELFTH IN THE TOWN HALL OF LENS.

THE PEOPLE’S COURT EXPOSED THE HOUILLÈRES’ RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE MOST STARTLING CLARITY. SARTRE SUMMED UP THE PROCEEDINGS IN A POWERFUL INDICTMENT THAT ENDED WITH THESE WORDS: “I THEREFORE PUT THE FOLLOWING DECISION TO YOU: THE STATE-PROPRIETOR IS GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF FEBRUARY 4 1970. THE MANAGEMENT AND THE ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PIT 6 ARE THOSE WHO CARRY OUT ITS ORDERS. THEREFORE THEY ARE EQUALLY GUILTY OF DELIBERATE HOMICIDE. THEY DELIBERATELY PREFERRED OUTPUT TO SAFETY; THAT IS THEY SET THE PRODUCTION OF MATERIAL OBJECTS ABOVE THE MEN’S LIVES.” ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY THE SIX ALLEGED INCENDIARIES WERE TRIED AND ACQUITTED.

A LITTLE BEFORE THIS SARTRE HAD AGREED TO EDIT TWO OTHER LEFTIST PAPERS IN ADDITION TO LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE: TOUT WHICH WAS THE MOUTHPIECE OF V.L.R. AND LA PAROLE DU PEUPLE.

1971
AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY THERE WERE TWO TRIALS THAT ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION THE ONE IN THE USSR AT LENINGRAD AND THE OTHER IN SPAIN AT BURGOS. ON DECEMBER 16 1970 ELEVEN SOVIET CITIZENS—ONE UKRAINIAN ONE RUSSIAN NINE JEWS—APPEARED BEFORE THE LENINGRAD COURT. THEY HAD PLANNED TO HIJACK A PLANE IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY BUT THERE WERE LEAKS AND DURING THE NIGHT OF JUNE 15–16 BEFORE THEY HAD BEGUN TO CARRY ANYTHING INTO EFFECT THEY WERE ARRESTED IN VARIOUS CITIES. TWO OF THEM WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH—KUZNETSOV WHO HAD WORKED OUT THE PLOT AND DYMSCHITZ THE AIRLINE PILOT WHO WAS TO TAKE OVER THE CONTROLS ONCE THE CREW HAD BEEN TIED UP AND PUT OUT OF THE PLANE. SEVEN OF THE ACCUSED WERE GIVEN TEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS OF HARD LABOR AND TWO OTHERS FOUR AND EIGHT YEARS.? ON JANUARY 14 1971 THERE WAS A GREAT MEETING IN PARIS TO SUPPORT THEM AND SARTRE TOOK PART IN IT; LAURENT SCHWARTZ WAS ALSO THERE AS WELL AS MADAULE AND OUR ISRAELI FRIEND ELI BEN GAL. THEY ALL DENOUNCED THE SOVIET UNION’S ANTI-SEMITISM.

AT BURGOS THE TRIAL WAS OF BASQUES MEMBERS OF THE E.T.A. WHO WERE ACCUSED BY FRANCO OF PLOTTING AGAINST THE STATE. GISÈLE HALIMI WAS PRESENT AS AN OBSERVER AND SHE GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL IN A BOOK PUBLISHED BY GALLIMARD. SHE ASKED SARTRE FOR A PREFACE AND HE READILY AGREED TO WRITE ONE. HE GAVE AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF THE BASQUES’ PROBLEM AND AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR STRUGGLE REFERRING ESPECIALLY TO THE HISTORY OF THE E.T.A. HE SPOKE INDIGNANTLY OF THE FRANCO GOVERNMENT’S REPRESSION IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE BURGOS TRIAL HAD BEEN CONDUCTED. SINCE HE HAD A PERFECT EXAMPLE AT HAND HE TOOK THIS OCCASION OF AMPLIFYING AN IDEA THAT WAS NEAR TO HIS HEART: THE CONFLICT BETWEEN AN ABSTRACT UNIVERSAL—THAT UPON WHICH GOVERNMENTS BASE THEMSELVES—AND THE PARTICULAR CONCRETE UNIVERSAL AS IT IS EMBODIED BY FLESH-AND-BLOOD HUMAN BEINGS. IT WAS THE SECOND HE ASSERTED THAT WAS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE REBELLIONS OF COLORED PEOPLES WHETHER THEY WERE COLONIZED FROM WITHOUT OR WITHIN; AND IT WAS THE SECOND THAT WAS TRULY VALID BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZED MEN AS THEY EXISTED IN THEIR HUMAN CONDITION THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR WAY OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES AND NOT AS EMPTY CONCEPTS.

IN OPPOSITION TO A CENTRALIZING ABSTRACT SOCIALISM SARTRE ASSERTED THE VALUE OF “ANOTHER SOCIALISM DECENTRALIZING AND CONCRETE: SUCH IS THE BASQUES’ PARTICULAR UNIVERSAL THE ONE THAT THE E.T.A. RIGHTLY SET AGAINST THE ABSTRACT CENTRALIZATION OF THE OPPRESSORS.” WHAT SHOULD BE DONE HE SAID WAS TO BRING “SOCIALIST MAN” INTO BEING “ON THE BASIS OF HIS LAND HIS LANGUAGE AND EVEN HIS OLD WAYS AND CUSTOMS RESTORED. IT IS FROM THAT BASIS ONLY THAT MAN WILL GRADUALLY CEASE TO BE THE PRODUCTION OF HIS OWN PRODUCT AND AT LAST BECOME THE SON OF MAN.”

IT WAS FROM THE SAME POINT OF VIEW THAT TWO YEARS LATER SARTRE DEVOTED AN ISSUE OF LES TEMPS MODERNES (AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1973) TO THE CLAIMS OF THE BRETONS THE LANGUEDOCIANS AND ALL THE NATIONAL MINORITIES OPPRESSED BY CENTRALISM.

GEISMAR WAS IMPRISONED AT THE SANTÉ. ALTHOUGH HIS WAS A COMPARATIVELY FAVORED FORM OF CONFINEMENT HE MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS WHO HAD BEGUN A HUNGER STRIKE TO ENFORCE THEIR DEMAND FOR MORE BEARABLE CONDITIONS OF IMPRISONMENT FOR THE COMMON-LAW CONVICTS AND FOR THEMSELVES. A FEW LEFTISTS DECIDED TO GO ON A HUNGER STRIKE TOO IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR CLAIMS. A PRIEST WITH ADVANCED VIEWS SHELTERED THEM IN SAINT BERNARD’S CHAPEL IN THE MONTPARNASSE RAILWAY STATION. MICHÈLE VIAN WAS ONE OF THE STRIKERS AND SARTRE VISITED THEM QUITE OFTEN. HE WENT WITH THEM WHEN AFTER TWENTY-ONE DAYS THEY BROKE OFF THEIR FAST AND TRIED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH PLEVEN. SINCE THEY WERE TOO WEAK TO GO FAR THEY WERE DRIVEN TO THE PLACE DE L’OPÉRA AND FROM THERE THEY WALKED TO THE PLACE VENDÔME. THEY CALLED AT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE BUT PLEVEN REFUSED TO SEE THEM. LATER HE GAVE IN GRANTING THE PRISONERS WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THE STRIKE A SPECIAL STATUS AND PROMISING TO IMPROVE THE COMMON-LAW CONVICTS’ LOT—A PROMISE THAT WAS SCARCELY KEPT AT ALL.

ON FEBRUARY 13 SARTRE LET HIS MAOIST COMRADES PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE PART IN A RATHER FOOLISH VENTURE—THE OCCUPATION OF THE SACRÉ COEUR. DURING A SECOURS ROUGE DEMONSTRATION A V.L.R. MILITANT NAMED RICHARD DESHAYES HAD BEEN DISFIGURED BY A TEAR-GAS GRENADE. IN ORDER TO AROUSE PUBLIC OPINION THE G.P. DECIDED TO OCCUPY THE BASILICA. THEY COUNTED ON MSGR. CHARLES’S CONSENT. ACCOMPANIED BY JEAN-CLAUDE VERNIER GILBERT CASTRO AND LILIANE SIEGEL SARTRE WENT INTO THE CHURCH—THERE WERE SOME WORSHIPPERS PRESENT—AND ASKED TO SEE MSGR. CHARLES. THE PRIEST HE SPOKE TO SAID THAT HE WOULD PASS ON HIS REQUEST. A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WENT BY AND THE PRIEST DID NOT COME BACK. THEN ALL THE DOORS BUT ONE WERE CLOSED AND THE DEMONSTRATORS—A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER BY NOW—SAW THAT THEY WERE TRAPPED. AS THE C.R.S. CAME IN BY THE ONE DOOR REMAINING OPEN HITTING EVERYONE WITHOUT DISTINCTION CASTRO AND VERNIER GRASPED SARTRE AND LILIANE AND HID THEM IN A CORNER. THEN THEY MANAGED TO GET THEM OUT MADE THEM GET INTO VERNIER’S CAR AND SET THEM DOWN AT A CAFÉ. WHEN THEY CAME BACK A LITTLE LATER THEY SAID THAT THE CLASH HAD BEEN VERY VIOLENT. ONE YOUNG MAN HAD HAD HIS THIGH PIERCED THROUGH BY A RAILING SPIKE. SARTRE THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING LAMENTABLE—IT COULD NOT BUT DISCOURAGE THE MILITANTS WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN SEVERELY KNOCKED ABOUT AT THE END OF A DEMONSTRATION A FEW DAYS EARLIER. ON FEBRUARY 15 HE AND JEAN-LUC GODARD GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND THE PAPERS DEVOTED A GREAT DEAL OF SPACE TO IT. ON FEBRUARY 18 HE WITHDREW FROM SECOURS ROUGE IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT THE MAOISTS HAD BECOME TOO POWERFUL.A

A FEW DAYS LATER THE GUIOT AFFAIR ERUPTED. GUIOT WAS A BOY AT A STATE SECONDARY SCHOOL A LYCÉE WHO WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF HITTING A POLICEMAN AND WHO WAS ARRESTED ALLEGEDLY IN FLAGRANTE DELICTO. THE OTHER LYCÉENS PROTESTED IN FORCE AND THOUSANDS OF THEM SAT ON THE SIDEWALK IN THE LATIN QUARTER WHERE A GREAT NUMBER OF POLICE VANS WERE DRAWN UP. IN THE END GUIOT WAS ACQUITTED BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE STREETS OF PARIS REMAINED VERY TENSE. ON ALL THE WALLS THERE WERE HUGE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DISFIGURED DESHAYES. IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH THE LEFTISTS AND ORDRE NOUVEAU CAME INTO EXTRAORDINARILY VIOLENT CONFLICT AND MANY POLICEMEN WERE WOUNDED.

SARTRE FOLLOWED ALL THIS TURBULENCE AND UNREST CLOSELY. HIS HEALTH SEEMED VERY GOOD. HE WENT ON CORRECTING THE PROOFS OF THE FAMILY IDIOT; HE ATTENDED ALL THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETINGS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN MY APARTMENT.

AT THE BEGINNING OF APRIL WE LEFT FOR SAINT-PAUL-DE-VENCE. SARTRE WENT BY TRAIN WITH ARLETTE AND I DROVE DOWN WITH SYLVIE. THE HOTEL WHERE WE STAYED WAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE TOWN—A TOWN CROWDED WITH TOURISTS DURING THE DAY BUT QUIET IN THE MORNINGS AND EVENINGS WHEN IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE OUR CHERISHED MEMORY OF IT. ARLETTE AND SARTRE WERE IN AN ANNEX SYLVIE AND I IN A LITTLE HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF A GARDEN FILLED WITH ORANGE TREES. IT HAD A BIG BEDROOM OPENING ONTO A VERY SMALL TERRACE AND AN IMMENSE LIVING ROOM WITH WHITE ROUGHCAST WALLS AND EXPOSED BEAMS; ON THE WALLS THERE WERE BEAUTIFUL VIVIDLY COLORED PICTURES BY CALDER. THE ROOM HAD A LONG WOODEN TABLE A COUCH AND A SIDEBOARD AND IT GAVE ON TO THE GARDEN. IT WAS THERE THAT I SPENT MOST OF MY EVENINGS WITH SARTRE DRINKING SCOTCH AND TALKING. WE DINED ON A PIECE OF DRIED SAUSAGE OR A SLAB OF CHOCOLATE BUT FOR LUNCH I TOOK HIM TO THE GOOD RESTAURANTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SOMETIMES ALL FOUR OF US WENT TOGETHER.

THE FIRST EVENING WE WERE ASTONISHED BY THE HUGE ILLUMINATIONS ON THE HILLSIDE FACING SAINT-PAUL: IT WAS THE GREENHOUSES BRILLIANTLY LIT AT NIGHT BY ELECTRICITY.

IN THE AFTERNOON WE OFTEN READ ON OUR OWN OR WE WENT FOR WALKS GOING BACK TO THE PLACES WE HAD LIKED. AMONG OTHERS WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE CAGNES AGAIN AND THE CHARMING HOTEL WHERE WE HAD HAD A DELIGHTFUL STAY MANY YEARS BEFORE. ONE AFTERNOON WE WENT TO THE FONDATION MAEGHT WITH WHICH WE WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR. THEY WERE HAVING A CHAR EXHIBITION AND THE PICTURES GROUPED AROUND HIS MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL—PICTURES BY KLEE VIEIRA DA SILVA GIACOMETTI AND MANY BY MIRÓ WHOSE WORK BECAME RICHER AND RICHER THE OLDER HE GREW.

ON THE LAST DAY SARTRE ORDERED AIOLI AND SINCE THERE WAS NO SUN WE ATE IT IN THE “CHAUFFOIR” A PLEASANT SPACIOUS ROOM WITH AN IMMENSE FIREPLACE AND MANY BOOKS. HE LEFT BY TRAIN THAT EVENING WITH ARLETTE AND SYLVIE AND I DROVE OFF THE NEXT MORNING. SARTRE HAD TRULY ENJOYED THIS VACATION.

HE WAS VERY HAPPY TOO TO BE BACK IN PARIS WHERE HE RECEIVED A HUGE CASE FROM GALLIMARD FULL OF COPIES OF THE FAMILY IDIOT—TWO THOUSAND PRINTED PAGES. HE TOLD ME THAT IT GAVE HIM AS MUCH PLEASURE AS THE PUBLICATION OF NAUSEA. IT WAS MOST WARMLY AND APPRECIATIVELY REVIEWED AT ONCE.

AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY POUILLON TOLD US OF THE DEATH OF THE FRIEND I CALLED PAGNIEZ IN MY MEMOIRS. ACCORDING TO HIM WHEN PAGNIEZ RETIRED HE WAS SO BORED THAT HE LET HIMSELF DIE. HE HAD HEPATITIS AND IT DEGENERATED INTO CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. AS MME LEMAIRE HAD DIED A FEW YEARS EARLIER PAGNIEZ’S DEATH MEANT THAT THE WHOLE OF ONE HAPPY PERIOD OF OUR PAST HAD FINALLY VANISHED. BUT FOR A GREAT WHILE PAGNIEZ HAD BEEN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO US AND WE HEARD THE NEWS UNMOVED.

IT WAS ALSO AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY THAT GOYTISOLO TELEPHONED SARTRE AND IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION ASKED HIM TO SIGN AN EXCEEDINGLY VIOLENT LETTER OF PROTEST ADDRESSED TO FIDEL CASTRO ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PADILLA AFFAIR. THIS AFFAIR HAD HAD VARIOUS STAGES: (1) THE ARREST OF PADILLA A POET VERY WELL KNOWN IN CUBA ON THE CHARGE OF SODOMY; (2) A POLITE LETTER OF PROTEST SIGNED BY GOYTISOLO FRANQUI SARTRE MYSELF AND SOME OTHERS; (3) PADILLA WAS RELEASED AND WROTE AN INSANE SELF-CRITICISM IN WHICH HE ACCUSED DUMONT AND KAROL OF BEING AGENTS OF THE C.I.A. HIS WIFE ALSO PRODUCED A SELF-CRITICISM STATING THAT THE POLICE HAD TREATED HER “TENDERLY.” THESE DECLARATIONS AROUSED A GREAT MANY PROTESTS. IN LE MONDE ARCOCHA OUR FORMER CUBAN INTERPRETER WHO HAD ALSO CHOSEN EXILE SAID THAT PADILLA AND HIS WIFE MUST HAVE BEEN TORTURED TO PRODUCE CONFESSIONS OF SUCH A KIND. IN THE BACKGROUND OF ALL THIS LOOMED THE SINISTER FIGURE OF LYSSENDRO OTERO. IN 1960 HE HAD BEEN WITH US DURING ALMOST THE WHOLE OF OUR JOURNEY; NOW HE SEEMED TO HAVE CULTURE IN ITS ENTIRETY UNDER HIS THUMB. GOYTISOLO WAS OF THE OPINION THAT CUBA WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF A VERITABLE GANG ALL BELONGING TO THE POLICE. WE LEARNED THAT CASTRO NOW LOOKED UPON SARTRE AS AN ENEMY AND AS BEING UNDER THE BALEFUL INFLUENCE OF FRANQUI. IN A SPEECH HE MADE AT THIS PERIOD CASTRO ATTACKED MOST OF THE FRENCH INTELLECTUALS: SARTRE WAS UNMOVED SINCE HE HAD NO LONGER HAD ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT CUBA.

AS WELL AS EVERYDAY CONTACTS AND HIS LEFTIST COMRADES SARTRE AND I ALSO SAW VARIOUS FRIENDS WHEN THE HOLIDAYS WERE OVER AND EVERYONE WAS BACK IN PARIS. TITO GERASSI TOLD US ABOUT THE AMERICAN UNDERGROUND. ROSSANA ROSSANDA DESCRIBED THE UPS AND DOWNS OF HER PAPER MANIFESTO WHICH WAS TO CHANGE FROM A WEEKLY TO A DAILY. ROBERT GALLIMARD LET US KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD. WE HAD LUNCH WITH ALI THE EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST WHO HAD ESCORTED US DURING OUR TOUR OF HIS COUNTRY IN 1967. AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY WE MET OUR JAPANESE FRIEND TOMIKO AGAIN AND SHE TOLD US ABOUT THE LONG JOURNEY SHE HAD JUST MADE IN ASIA.

ON MAY 12 SARTRE TOOK PART IN A MEETING HELD BEFORE THE IVRY TOWN HALL. BEHAR BEHALA A SOMEWHAT FEEBLE-MINDED IMMIGRANT HAD STOLEN A POT OF YOGURT FROM A VAN; THE POLICE FIRED AND WOUNDED HIM SERIOUSLY. AFTER AN INVESTIGATION SECOURS ROUGE ORGANIZED A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE POLICE.

AT THIS POINT SARTRE WAS STAYING MUCH OF THE TIME WITH ME BECAUSE HIS ELEVATOR WAS OUT OF ORDER AND HE FOUND IT VERY TIRING TO WALK UP TEN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS. ON TUESDAY MAY 18 AS ON ALL OTHER TUESDAYS SARTRE ARRIVED AT MY PLACE IN THE EVENING; HE HAD SPENT THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND NIGHT WITH ARLETTE. “HOW ARE YOU?” I ASKED IN THE ORDINARY RATHER CASUAL WAY. “WELL NOT SO GOOD.” AND INDEED HIS LEGS WERE GIVING WAY UNDER HIM HE SPOKE INDISTINCTLY AND HIS MOUTH WAS A LITTLE TWISTED. I HAD NOT NOTICED THAT HE WAS AILING THE DAY BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO MUSIC AND HAD HARDLY TALKED AT ALL. BUT THAT EVENING HE HAD REACHED ARLETTE’S IN A BAD WAY AND HE HAD AWAKENED THIS MORNING IN THE STATE IN WHICH I SAW HIM NOW; OBVIOUSLY HE HAD HAD A SLIGHT STROKE DURING THE NIGHT. I HAD DREADED AN OCCURRENCE OF THIS KIND FOR A LONG WHILE AND I HAD VOWED I WOULD KEEP MY HEAD. I FORCED MYSELF TO REMEMBER THE CASE OF FRIENDS WHO HAD GONE THROUGH THE SAME SORT OF TRIAL AND WHO HAD RECOVERED PERFECTLY. IN ANY EVENT SARTRE WAS TO SEE HIS DOCTOR THE NEXT DAY AND THAT CALMED ME A LITTLE BUT ONLY A LITTLE. I HAD TO MAKE A GREAT EFFORT NOT TO LET MY PANIC SHOW. SARTRE INSISTED UPON DRINKING HIS USUAL DOSE OF WHISKEY SO THAT BY MIDNIGHT HE COULD NOT PRONOUNCE HIS WORDS AT ALL AND FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAG HIMSELF AS FAR AS HIS BED. ALL NIGHT LONG I STRUGGLED AGAINST ANGUISH.

THE NEXT MORNING LILIANE SIEGEL WENT WITH HIM TO DR. ZAIDMANN’S. HE TELEPHONED TO TELL ME THAT ALL WAS WELL; HE HAD A BLOOD PRESSURE READING OF 180 WHICH WAS NORMAL FOR HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO START ON A SERIOUS COURSE OF TREATMENT RIGHT AWAY. A LITTLE LATER LILIANE ALSO SPEAKING ON THE TELEPHONE WAS LESS SANGUINE. ACCORDING TO ZAIDMANN THE CRISIS WAS WORSE THAN THAT OF OCTOBER AND IT WAS WORRYING THAT THE ANOMALIES SHOULD HAVE COME BACK SO QUICKLY. NO DOUBT ONE OF THE REASONS WAS THAT SINCE MARCH HE HAD NO LONGER BEEN TAKING HIS MEDICINES AND IT HAD ALSO BEEN VERY BAD FOR HIM TO WALK UP TEN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS EVERY NOW AND THEN. BUT THE ESSENCE OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BLOOD HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN CIRCULATING IN A CERTAIN AREA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS BRAIN.

I WENT TO SEE SARTRE IN THE AFTERNOON AND I FOUND HIM NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE. ZAIDMANN HAD STRICTLY FORBIDDEN HIM TO WALK. FORTUNATELY HIS ELEVATOR HAD BEEN REPAIRED. THAT EVENING SYLVIE DROVE US TO MY APARTMENT AND SHE STAYED WITH US A WHILE. SARTRE DRANK NOTHING BUT FRUIT JUICE. SHE WAS HORRIFIED AT HIS APPEARANCE. I IMAGINE THAT ALTHOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED IT THE STROKE MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE SHOCK; HE LOOKED QUITE PROSTRATED. HIS CIGARETTE KEPT DROPPING FROM HIS LIPS. SYLVIE WOULD PICK IT UP AND HAND IT TO HIM; HE WOULD TAKE IT AND IT WOULD SLIP OUT OF HIS GRASP. I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THE PROCESS WAS REPEATED DURING THE COURSE OF THAT GHASTLY EVENING. SINCE THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF CONVERSATION I PUT ON RECORDS AMONG OTHERS VERDI’S REQUIEM WHICH SARTRE WAS VERY FOND OF. “IT’S MOST APPROPRIATE” HE MURMURED CHILLING SYLVIE AND ME THROUGH AND THROUGH. SHE LEFT SHORTLY AFTER THIS AND PRESENTLY SARTRE WENT TO BED. WHEN HE WOKE UP IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS RIGHT ARM WAS SO HEAVY AND NUMB THAT HE COULD SCARCELY MOVE IT. WHEN LILIANE CAME TO FETCH HIM FOR BREAKFAST SHE WHISPERED “I THINK HE LOOKS WORSE THAN YESTERDAY.” AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE I TELEPHONED DR. LEBEAU AT THE HOSPITAL. HE COULD NOT COME HIMSELF BUT HE WOULD SEND ANOTHER SPECIALIST. I JOINED SARTRE AT HIS APARTMENT AND AT HALF PAST ELEVEN DR. MAHOUDEAU ARRIVED. HE EXAMINED SARTRE FOR AN HOUR AND HE REASSURED ME; THE UNDERLYING PERCEPTION WAS UNAFFECTED THE MIND WAS UNHARMED AND THE SLIGHT STAMMER CAME FROM THE TWIST TO HIS MOUTH. THE RIGHT HAND WAS WEAK. SARTRE STILL FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO HOLD A CIGARETTE. HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS 140; THIS WAS A DISTURBING FALL AND IT WAS CAUSED BY THE MEDICINES HE WAS TAKING. MAHOUDEAU WROTE A NEW PRESCRIPTION AND ADVISED THE UTMOST CARE FOR THE NEXT FORTY-EIGHT HOURS. SARTRE WAS TO REST A GREAT DEAL AND NEVER BE ALONE. IF HE DID THIS HE WOULD RECOVER ENTIRELY IN TEN TO TWENTY DAYS.

SARTRE HAD MEEKLY SUBMITTED TO ALL THE EXAMINATIONS BUT HE REFUSED TO STAY IN HIS ROOM. IT WAS ASCENSION DAY AND SYLVIE DID NOT HAVE TO GO TO HER LYCÉE. SHE DROVE US TO LA COUPOLE WHERE WE ALL THREE HAD LUNCH. SARTRE WAS DISTINCTLY BETTER. YET HIS MOUTH WAS STILL TWISTED. THE NEXT DAY WHEN HE WAS LUNCHING IN THE SAME PLACE WITH ARLETTE FRANÇOIS PÉRIER SAW HIM AND COMING TO MY TABLE HE SAID “IT’S ODIOUS WHAT’S HAPPENED TO HIM WITH THAT MOUTH ALL PULLED SIDEWAYS—IT’S VERY SERIOUS.” FORTUNATELY I KNEW THAT THIS TIME IT WAS NOT VERY SERIOUS. DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS THINGS WENT WELL AND ON MONDAY MORNING ZAIDMANN SAID THAT PRESENTLY SARTRE WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP THE TREATMENT BUT HE ADDED THAT THE SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME AND HE EVEN TOLD ARLETTE THAT PERHAPS SARTRE WOULD NEVER BE ENTIRELY CURED.

YET BY WEDNESDAY MAY 26 WHEN WE SPENT THE EVENING WITH BOST SARTRE HAD COMPLETELY RECOVERED THE POWER OF WALKING AND SPEAKING AND HIS GOOD HUMOR HAD COME BACK. LAUGHING I TOLD BOST IN FRONT OF HIM THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE COMPELLED TO WRANGLE WITH SARTRE TO KEEP HIM FROM DRINKING TOO MUCH ALCOHOL TEA COFFEE AND STIMULANTS. SARTRE WENT UPSTAIRS TO BED AND FROM THE BALCONY THAT OVERHANGS MY LIVING ROOM HE QUIETLY SANG “I DON’T WANT TO GRIEVE MY CASTOR EVEN TO THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE …”B IT TOUCHED ME DEEPLY. AND I WAS TOUCHED TOO WHEN WE WERE HAVING LUNCH AT LA COUPOLE AND HE POINTED OUT A DARK-HAIRED GIRL WITH BLUE EYES AND A RATHER ROUND FACE ASKING “DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE MAKES ME THINK OF? YOU WHEN YOU WERE HER AGE.”

HIS RIGHT HAND WAS STILL WEAK. IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO PLAY THE PIANO WHICH HE LIKED DOING AT ARLETTE’S AND IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO WRITE. BUT FOR THE MOMENT THAT WAS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE. UNTIL HE SHOULD START WORK AGAIN HE WAS CORRECTING THE PROOFS OF SITUATIONS VIII AND IX AND THAT KEPT HIM BUSY ENOUGH.

IN JUNE HE AND MAURICE CLAVEL SET UP THE LIBÉRATION PRESS AGENCY. THEY BOTH SIGNED A PAPER IN WHICH THEY SET OUT THE AIMS OF THE AGENCY WHICH RECKONED ON BEING ABLE TO PUBLISH A NEWS BULLETIN EVERY DAY:

WE ALL WISH TO CREATE A NEW INSTRUMENT FOR THE DEFENSE OF TRUTH TOGETHER.… IT IS NOT ENOUGH MERELY TO KNOW THE TRUTH; ONE MUST ALSO MAKE IT HEARD. THE LIBÉRATION PRESS AGENCY MEANS TO BE A NEW PLATFORM WHERE JOURNALISTS WHO WANT TO SAY EVERYTHING MAY SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING. IT WILL GIVE THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK.

AT THE END OF JUNE SARTRE BEGAN TO SUFFER CRUELLY FROM HIS TONGUE. HE COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK WITHOUT PAIN. I SAID TO HIM “REALLY THIS IS A HORRIBLE YEAR; YOU HAVE TROUBLES ALL THE TIME.” “OH IT DOESN’T MATTER” HE REPLIED. “WHEN YOU’RE OLD IT NO LONGER HAS ANY IMPORTANCE.” “HOW DO YOU MEAN?” “YOU KNOW IT WON’T LAST LONG.” “YOU MEAN BECAUSE ONE’S GOING TO DIE?” “YES. IT’S NATURAL TO COME TO PIECES LITTLE BY LITTLE. WHEN YOU’RE YOUNG IT’S DIFFERENT.” THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THIS OVERWHELMED ME; HE ALREADY SEEMED TO BE ON THE FAR SIDE OF LIFE. WHAT IS MORE EVERYBODY NOTICED THIS DETACHMENT. A GREAT MANY THINGS SEEMED TO LEAVE HIM INDIFFERENT NO DOUBT BECAUSE HE WAS LOSING INTEREST IN HIS OWN FATE. HE WAS OFTEN IF NOT SAD THEN AT LEAST REMOTE. I NEVER SAW HIM REALLY CHEERFUL EXCEPT DURING OUR EVENINGS WITH SYLVIE. WE CELEBRATED SARTRE’S SIXTY-SIXTH BIRTHDAY IN JUNE AT HER PLACE AND HE WAS RADIANT.

HE WENT BACK TO HIS DENTIST AND HIS PAIN STOPPED. AT ONCE THE PROGRESS THAT HE HAD MADE SINCE MAY BECAME APPARENT. ZAIDMANN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD ENTIRELY RECOVERED. AND SEVERAL TIMES SARTRE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS YEAR.

STILL I FELT VERY ANXIOUS LEAVING HIM. HE WAS GOING TO SPEND THREE WEEKS WITH ARLETTE AND TWO WITH WANDA WHILE I TRAVELED WITH SYLVIE. I LIKED THESE JOURNEYS BUT PARTING FROM SARTRE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING OF A WRENCH FOR ME. THIS TIME WE HAD LUNCH TOGETHER AT LA COUPOLE WHERE SYLVIE WAS TO COME FOR ME AT FOUR O’CLOCK. I STOOD UP THREE MINUTES BEFORE THE HOUR. HE GAVE ME AN INDEFINABLE SMILE AND SAID “SO THIS IS THE FAREWELL CEREMONY!” I TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER WITHOUT REPLYING. THE SMILE AND THE WORDS STAYED WITH ME FOR A GREAT WHILE. I GAVE THE WORD FAREWELL THE ULTIMATE MEANING IT WAS TO HAVE SOME YEARS LATER; BUT WHEN THAT HAPPENED I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO SAY IT.

I LEFT FOR ITALY WITH SYLVIE AND THE NEXT NIGHT WE STAYED AT BOLOGNA. IN THE MORNING WE TOOK THE HIGHWAY THAT LED TO THE EAST COAST. THE LANDSCAPE WAS DROWNED IN A WARM FOG AND NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I KNOWN SUCH A FEELING OF ABSURDITY AND FORSAKENNESS. WHAT WAS I DOING HERE? WHY HAD I COME? MY LOVE FOR ITALY SOON SEIZED ME AGAIN BUT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP I WEPT FOR A LONG WHILE.

MEANWHILE SARTRE WAS IN SWITZERLAND; FROM TIME TO TIME A TELEGRAM TOLD ME THAT HE WAS WELL. BUT WHEN I REACHED ROME WHERE HE WAS TO JOIN ME I FOUND A LETTER FROM ARLETTE. ON JULY 15 SARTRE HAD HAD A RELAPSE. ON WAKING HE REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS HE HAD THE FIRST TIME. HIS MOUTH WAS EVEN MORE TWISTED THAN IT HAD BEEN IN MAY PRONUNCIATION WAS DIFFICULT AND HIS ARM INSENSITIVE TO HEAT AND COLD. ARLETTE TOOK HIM TO A DOCTOR IN BERNE AND SARTRE UTTERLY FORBADE HER TO LET ME KNOW. THREE DAYS LATER THE CRISIS WAS OVER BUT SHE HAD TELEPHONED ZAIDMANN WHO SAID “HIS ARTERIES MUST BE VERY WORN FOR HIM TO HAVE SPASMS LIKE THAT.”

I WENT TO FETCH HIM AT THE TERMINI STATION. BEFORE I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE HAILED ME. HE WAS WEARING A LIGHT-COLORED SUIT AND HE HAD A CAP ON HIS HEAD. HIS FACE WAS SWOLLEN—ONE OF HIS TEETH WAS ABSCESSED—BUT HE SEEMED IN GOOD HEALTH. WE SETTLED IN OUR LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE HOTEL. IT HAD A TERRACE WHICH GAVE US A BOUNDLESS VIEW OUT OVER THE QUIRINAL THE ROOF OF THE PANTHEON SAINT PETER’S AND THE CAPITOL WHOSE LIGHTS WE SAW GO OUT EVERY NIGHT AT TWELVE. THAT YEAR PART OF THE TERRACE HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A DRAWING ROOM SEPARATED FROM THE OPEN-AIR SECTION BY A GLASS SCREEN AND WE COULD SIT THERE AT ANY TIME. SARTRE’S ABSCESS WENT DOWN AND HE HAD NO OTHER TROUBLE. HE NO LONGER SEEMED REMOTE AND HE WAS FULL OF LIFE AND MERRIMENT. HE STAYED UP UNTIL ONE IN THE MORNING AND ROSE ABOUT HALF PAST SEVEN. WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY ROOM TOWARD NINE I WOULD FIND HIM SITTING ON THE TERRACE GAZING AT THE BEAUTY OF ROME OR READING. HE SLEPT FOR TWO HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON BUT HE NO LONGER HAD FITS OF DROWSINESS. IN NAPLES WITH WANDA HE HAD GONE FOR LONG WALKS; AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD REVISITED POMPEII. IN ROME WE SCARCELY FELT ANY DESIRE TO WALK; WITHOUT HAVING TO STIR WE WERE EVERYWHERE.

ABOUT TWO O’CLOCK WE WOULD EAT A SANDWICH NEAR THE HOTEL; IN THE EVENING WE WALKED ALONG TO DINE IN THE PIAZZA NAVONA OR IN A NEARBY RESTAURANT. SOMETIMES SYLVIE DROVE US TO TRASTEVERE OR THE VIA APPIA ANTICA. SARTRE PRUDENTLY PUT ON HIS HAT WHEN HE CROSSED A SUNNY STRETCH. HE TOOK HIS MEDICINES REGULARLY DRANK A SINGLE GLASS OF WHITE WINE AT LUNCH BEER AT DINNER AND THEN TWO GLASSES OF WHISKEY ON THE TERRACE. NO COFFEE AND TEA ONLY FOR BREAKFAST (IN OTHER YEARS HE HAD DRUNK AN EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL BREW AT FIVE O’CLOCK). HE CORRECTED THE THIRD VOLUME OF THE FAMILY IDIOT AND AMUSED HIMSELF BY READING GIALLI ITALIAN DETECTIVE STORIES. FROM TIME TO TIME WE SAW ROSSANA ROSSANDA AND ONE AFTERNOON OUR YUGOSLAV FRIEND DEDIJER CALLED ON US.

LOOKING AT SARTRE AS HE WAS DURING THIS ROMAN VACATION ONE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM TWENTY YEARS OF LIFE TO COME. WHAT IS MORE HE RECKONED ON IT HIMSELF. ONE DAY WHEN I COMPLAINED THAT WE ALWAYS CHANCED ON THE SAME GIALLI HE SAID “IT’S NATURAL. THERE’S ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF THEM. YOU CAN’T HOPE TO READ NEW ONES ALL THROUGH THE TWENTY YEARS TO COME.”

SARTRE WAS STILL VERY WELL WHEN HE WAS BACK IN PARIS—HIS BLOOD-PRESSURE WAS 170 AND HIS REFLEXES WERE GOOD. HE WENT TO BED AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND GOT UP AT HALF PAST EIGHT NO LONGER SLEEPING DURING THE DAY. HIS MOUTH WAS STILL VERY SLIGHTLY PARALYZED AND THIS MADE IT HARD FOR HIM TO CHEW AND SOMETIMES HE LISPED. NOR WAS HE IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF HIS HANDWRITING. BUT THESE THINGS DID NOT WORRY HIM. ONCE AGAIN HE WAS PAYING THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO PEOPLE AND EVENTS. HE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THE CORDIAL RECEPTION THAT THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES OF THE FAMILY IDIOT HAD MET WITH; HE DELIVERED THE THIRD TO GALLIMARD AND SET ABOUT THE FOURTH IN WHICH HE INTENDED TO STUDY MADAME BOVARY. HE READ AND CAREFULLY CRITICIZED THE MANUSCRIPT OF MY NEXT BOOK ALL SAID AND DONE AND GAVE ME VERY GOOD ADVICE. IN MID-NOVEMBER I WROTE “SARTRE IS SO WELL THAT I HAVE ALMOST ENTIRELY STOPPED WORRYING.”

AT THE END OF NOVEMBER TOGETHER WITH FOUCAULT AND GENET HE TOOK PART IN A DEMONSTRATION IN THE GOUTTE D’OR DISTRICT TO PROTEST AGAINST THE MURDER OF DJELALLI A FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD-ALGERIAN. THE CONCIERGE OF HIS BUILDING HAD SHOT HIM DOWN WITH A RIFLE ON OCTOBER 27; THE BOY MADE TOO MUCH NOISE HE SAID. THEN NOT CARING WHETHER HE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF OR NOT HE STATED THAT HE HAD TAKEN HIM FOR A THIEF.

SARTRE WALKED ALONG THE RUE POISSONNIÈRE IN FRONT OF FOUCAULT AND CLAUDE MAURIAC WHO CARRIED A BANDEROLE ON WHICH COULD BE READ AN APPEAL TO THE WORKERS OF THE DISTRICT. THE COPS RECOGNIZED SARTRE AND DID NOT INTERVENE. HE MADE A SPEECH USING A MEGAPHONE AND ANNOUNCING THE SETTING UP OF THE DJELALLI COMMITTEE’S OFFICE. IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE NEXT DAY ONWARD IN THE PARISH HALL OF THE GOUTTE D’OR UNTIL ANOTHER PLACE COULD BE FOUND FOR IT. THE PROCESSION WENT ON AS FAR AS THE BOULEVARD DE LA CHAPELLE FOUCAULT SPEAKING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. SARTRE WANTED TO TAKE HIS TURN AT THE COMMITTEE’S OFFICE BUT WHEN HE AND GENET HAD LUNCH TOGETHER SOME DAYS LATER GENET ADVISED AGAINST IT NOT CONSIDERING HIM FIT ENOUGH.

I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER SARTRE WAS AWARE OF THIS UNFITNESS BUT SUDDENLY DURING THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 1 HE SAID TO ME “I’VE USED UP MY STORE OF HEALTH. I WON’T LIVE BEYOND SEVENTY.” I PROTESTED. HE WENT ON “YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF THAT PEOPLE FIND IT HARD TO RECOVER FROM A THIRD STROKE.” I COULD NO LONGER REMEMBER HAVING SAID THAT; NO DOUBT IT HAD BEEN A WARNING AGAINST POSSIBLE OVERINDULGENCES. “THE ONES YOU’VE HAD WERE VERY SLIGHT” I SAID. HE CONTINUED “I’M AFRAID I SHAN’T FINISH THE FLAUBERT.” “DOES THAT GRIEVE YOU?” “YES IT DOES.” AND HE SPOKE TO ME ABOUT HIS FUNERAL. HE WANTED A VERY SIMPLE CEREMONY AND HE WANTED TO BE CREMATED. ABOVE ALL HE DID NOT WISH TO BE BURIED IN THE PÈRE LACHAISE GRAVEYARD BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND STEPFATHER. HE HOPED THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF MAOISTS WOULD FOLLOW HIS COFFIN. IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT HE TOLD ME BUT THINK ABOUT IT HE DID.

ON THIS SUBJECT FORTUNATELY HIS MOOD WAS CHANGEABLE. ON JANUARY 12 1972 HE SAID TO ME WITH A HAPPY LOOK “PERHAPS WE’LL LIVE A GREAT WHILE YET.” NOW AND THEN HE WOULD MAKE A LAUGHING ALLUSION TO HIS “MINIPLEGIA” BUT HE DID NOT THINK THAT HE WAS IN ANY DANGER.

1972
AS PLEVEN’S PROMISES ABOUT CHANGING THE PRISON SYSTEM HAD NOT BEEN KEPT SARTRE DECIDED TO GIVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. ON JANUARY 18 1972 HE AND MICHÈLE VIAN WENT TO THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL TO MEET MEMBERS OF SECOURS ROUGE AND SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS—DELEUZE FOUCAULT AND CLAUDE MAURIAC. TWO RADIO CARS FROM RADIO LUXEMBOURG AND EUROPE 1 WERE THERE. THE DELEGATION MOVED OFF TO THE PLACE VENDÔME AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. FOUCAULT SPOKE AND READ THE REPORT SENT BY THE PRISONERS AT MELUN. THERE WERE CRIES OF “PLEVEN RESIGN. PLEVEN TO THE BLACK HOLE. PLEVEN MURDERER.” THE C.R.S. DISPERSED THE MEETING. THEY ARRESTED JAUBERT A JOURNALIST WHO TRIED TO INTERVENE WHEN AN IMMIGRANT WAS BEING CLUBBED AND WHO WAS SO SAVAGELY BEATEN UP THAT HE HAD TO BE TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL.C

SARTRE AND FOUCAULT STEPPED IN TO HAVE HIM RELEASED. FROM THE MINISTRY THE DEMONSTRATORS WENT ON TO THE LIBÉRATION PRESS AGENCY; HERE THERE WERE ABOUT THIRTY MILITANTS AND JOURNALISTS WHO HAD NOT BEEN AT THE PLACE VENDÔME AND AMONG THEM WAS ALAIN GEISMAR WHO HAD JUST COME OUT OF PRISON. SARTRE SAT AT A TABLE NEXT TO JEAN-PIERRE FAYE. HE GAVE AN AMUSING ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED: “THE C.R.S. WERE NOT PARTICULARLY BRUTAL” HE SAID “BUT THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY GENTLE EITHER: THEIR USUAL SELVES.” WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THE MEETING BROKE UP AND HE WENT HOME.

ONE UNDERTAKING THAT HE AGREED TO WITH A GREAT DEAL OF AMUSEMENT WAS THE FILM THAT CANTAT AND ASTRUC MADE OF HIM. HE WAS SURROUNDED BY HIS TEMPS MODERNES COLLEAGUESD AND IN REPLY TO THEIR QUESTIONS HE TALKED AND RECOUNTED HIS LIFE. THE FILMING USUALLY TOOK PLACE IN HIS APARTMENT SOMETIMES IN MINE. IT WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE MONOTONOUS SEEING HIM ALWAYS ENGAGED WITH THE SAME QUESTIONERS BUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO USED TO THEM THAT HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF SO FREELY AND NATURALLY. HE WAS FULL OF LIFE AND MERRIMENT—AT HIS BEST. HE HAD NOT WRITTEN A SEQUEL TO THE WORDS FOR FEAR OF HURTING MME MANCY AND BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TAKEN UP WITH OTHER WORK: IN THAT BOOK HE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS MOTHER’S REMARRIAGE HIS INNER BREAK WITH HER HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS STEPFATHER HIS LIFE AT LA ROCHELLE WHERE CLASSED AS A PARISIAN AND MORE OR LESS COLD-SHOULDERED BY THE OTHER SCHOOLBOYS HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT LONELINESS AND VIOLENCE. WHEN HE WAS ELEVEN HE HAD ALL AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IN GOD; AND AT ABOUT FIFTEEN EARTHLY IMMORTALITY HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF EVERLASTING AFTERLIFE FOR HIM. IT WAS THEN THAT HE HAD BEEN SEIZED BY WHAT HE CALLED “THE WRITING NEUROSIS”; AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE BOOKS HE READ HE BEGAN TO DREAM OF FAME WHICH AT THAT TIME HE ASSOCIATED WITH PHANTASMS OF DEATH.

HE DESCRIBED HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH NIZAN AND THEIR RIVALRY AND HIS DISCOVERY OF PROUST AND VALÉRY. IT WAS AT THIS PERIOD NEAR THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THAT HE BEGAN TO WRITE DOWN HIS IDEAS ALPHABETICALLY IN A NOTEBOOK HE HAD FOUND IN THE MÉTRO PUT OUT BY THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE MIDY SUPPOSITORIES. THE MAIN IDEA WAS ALREADY THAT OF FREEDOM. THEN HE GAVE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HIS HAPPY YEARS AT THE ECOLE NORMALE AND HE TOLD HOW HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD MILDLY PERSECUTED CONSERVATIVE PIOUS YOUTHS. HE HAD COME TO PHILOSOPHY THROUGH A READING OF BERGSON AND SINCE THEN IT HAD REMAINED ESSENTIAL FOR HIM: “WHAT BINDS EVERYTHING I DO TOGETHER IS PHILOSOPHY.”

HE SPOKE OF HIS STAY IN BERLIN AND HUSSERL’S INFLUENCE ON HIM; OF HIS CALLING AS A TEACHER HIS INTENSE DISLIKE OF GROWING UP THE NEUROSIS CAUSED BOTH BY THIS DISLIKE AND BY HIS EXPERIMENTS WITH MESCALINE WHICH WERE CONNECTED WITH HIS RESEARCHES INTO THE IMAGINARY. HE ALSO EXPLAINED WHAT NAUSEA AND THE TALE “THE WALL” MEANT TO HIM.

THE CONVERSATION THEN MOVED ON TO HIS TIME IN STALAG XII D THE PRODUCTION OF BARIONA HIS RETURN TO PARIS AND THE FLIES. THEN TO THE VOGUE OF EXISTENTIALISM THE ATTACKS DIRECTED AGAINST HIM AT THE END OF THE FORTIES THE MEANING OF LITERARY COMMITMENT AND HIS POLITICAL ATTITUDES—HIS JOINING THE R.D.R.E HIS BREAKING WITH IT HIS DECISION TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE COMMUNISTS IN 1952 BECAUSE OF THE SINISTER WAVE OF ANTI-COMMUNISM THAT WAS SWEEPING FRANCE AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE CASE OF DUCLOS AND THE CARRIER PIGEONS. HE MENTIONED DE GAULLE “A BANEFUL FIGURE IN HISTORY” AND HE CRIED OUT AGAINST THE ABJECT NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY SOCIETY.

HE SPOKE OF THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED WITH ETHICS AND OF HIS PLEASURE IN FINDING THESE SAME PREOCCUPATIONS IN ANOTHER FORM AMONG HIS MAOIST FRIENDS WHO LINKED ETHICS AND POLITICS. HE DEFINED HIS MORAL VIEWS AT LENGTH: “FUNDAMENTALLY THE PROBLEM FOR ME WAS TO KNOW WHETHER TO CHOOSE POLITICS OR ETHICS OR WHETHER POLITICS AND ETHICS WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING. NOW I HAVE COME BACK PERHAPS SOMEWHAT RICHER TO MY ORIGINAL POSITION—SETTING MYSELF AT THE LEVEL OF THE MASSES’ ACTION. AT PRESENT THERE IS A MORAL QUESTION ALMOST EVERYWHERE A MORAL QUESTION THAT IS NONE OTHER THAN THE POLITICAL QUESTION; AND IT IS ON THIS PLANE THAT I FIND MYSELF WHOLLY IN AGREEMENT FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE MAOISTS.… FUNDAMENTALLY I HAVE WRITTEN TWO ETHICS ONE BETWEEN 1945 AND 1946 COMPLETELY MISLED … AND THEN SOME NOTES ROUND ABOUT 1965 ON ANOTHER SYSTEM OF ETHICS WITH THE PROBLEM OF REALISM AND THAT OF MORALS.”

IN THE END HE WENT BACK TO A SUBJECT WHICH HE THOUGHT OF THE VERY FIRST IMPORTANCE—THE ANTITHESIS BETWEEN THE CLASSICAL INTELLECTUAL AND THE NEW INTELLECTUAL THAT HE HAD NOW ELECTED TO BE.

THE FILM WAS NOT YET FINISHED WHEN ON FEBRUARY 24 A BELGIAN FRIEND A LAWYER NAMED LALLEMANTF HAD SARTRE INVITED BY THE YOUNG BARRISTERS OF BRUSSELS TO GIVE A LECTURE ON REPRESSION. WE LEFT ABOUT ONE O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON TAKING THE AUTOROUTE. SYLVIE DROVE. IT WAS A FINE SUNNY DAY AND WE STOPPED IN A REST AREA TO EAT THE CROISSANTS AND HAM THAT SHE HAD PREPARED. WE REACHED BRUSSELS AT HALF PAST FIVE AND STRAIGHT AWAY WE FOUND THE HOTEL WHERE ROOMS HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR US. WHEN WE HAD SETTLED IN WE WENT TO HAVE A DRINK AT THE BAR WHERE LALLEMANT AND VERSTRAETEN JOINED US.G VERSTRAETEN STILL HAD HIS FINE BLUE EYES BUT HE WAS SO THIN THAT HE LOOKED LIKE CONRAD VEIDT. WE HAD DINNER WITH THEM AND SOME OTHER FRIENDS AT LE CYGNE ON THE GRAND PLACE A SQUARE THAT WE ADMIRED ALL OVER AGAIN. WE STROLLED FOR A WHILE IN THE LITTLE STREETS NEARBY AND THEN WE SET OFF FOR THE PALAIS DES CONGRÈS.

AT ONCE WE SAW THAT THE AUDIENCE WAS ENTIRELY MIDDLE-CLASS—IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE ELABORATELY DRESSED WOMEN HAD JUST HAD THEIR HAIR DONE. SARTRE HAD GIVEN UP TIES AND REGULAR SUITS SINCE 1968 AND THAT EVENING HE WAS WEARING A BLACK PULLOVER WHICH WAS LOOKED UPON WITH DISAPPROVAL. IN FACT HE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THESE PEOPLE AND WE COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY LALLEMANT HAD INVITED HIM.

WITHOUT MUCH ANIMATION SARTRE READ HIS PIECE ON CLASS JUSTICE AND PEOPLE’S JUSTICE. IN FRANCE HE SAID “THERE EXIST TWO KINDS OF JUSTICE: THE ONE WHICH IS BUREAUCRATIC IS USED FOR BINDING THE PROLETARIAT TO THEIR PROLETARIAN STATE; THE OTHER WHICH IS UNTAMED IS THE DEEP THRUST BY WHICH THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PLEBS JUST ASSERT THEIR FREEDOM AGAINST PROLETARIZATION.… THE SOURCE OF ALL JUSTICE IS THE PEOPLE.… I HAVE CHOSEN THE PEOPLE’S JUSTICE AS THE DEEPEST AND THE ONLY TRUE FORM.” HE WENT ON “IF AN INTELLECTUAL CHOOSES THE PEOPLE HE MUST KNOW THAT THE TIME OF SIGNING MANIFESTOES OF PLACID PROTEST MEETINGS OR OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN REFORMIST PAPERS IS OVER. HIS DUTY IS NOT SO MUCH TO SPEAK AS TO TRY BY THE MEANS THAT ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT OF SPEAKING.” WITH THIS HE EXPLAINED THE NATURE OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE AND OF THE PART HE HIMSELF PLAYED ON THE JOURNAL.

TO DEMONSTRATE THE FALSE DIRECTION OF BOURGEOIS LAWS HE QUOTED THE CASES OF GEISMAR AND ROLAND CASTRO AND THE AFFAIR OF THE FRIENDS OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE. HE DESCRIBED THE PRISON SYSTEM—A SYSTEM THAT HAD CONTINUALLY WORSENED DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS AND HE DENOUNCED THE HEAVY PRESSURE THAT WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE JUDGES.

ALL THIS FLOATED OVER THE HEADS OF HIS LISTENERS. THERE WERE A FEW RELEVANT QUESTIONS ASKED BY LEFTISTS AND A GREAT MANY FOOLISH ONES THAT SARTRE ANSWERED IN AN OFFHAND WAY. THE ONLY CHEERFUL THING IN THIS MEETING WAS THE SIGHT OF ASTRUC CREEPING ALONG THE GROUND WITH HIS CAMERA TO FILM SARTRE AS HE TALKED; HIS TROUSERS DROOPED AND HIS BARE BOTTOM APPEARED. THE FRONT ROW OF THE AUDIENCE FOUND IT VERY HARD TO KEEP THEIR FACES STRAIGHT.

AS EVERYBODY WAS LEAVING A WOMAN LOOKED AT SARTRE AND SAID ANGRILY “IT WASN’T WORTH DRESSING UP” AND ANOTHER “WHEN YOU SPEAK IN PUBLIC YOU MAKE AN EFFORT; YOU PUT ON PROPER CLOTHES.” AT ERASMUS’S CHARMING WELL-FURNISHED HOUSE WHERE THE YOUNG BARRISTERS WERE GIVING A COCKTAIL PARTY THE THEME WAS TAKEN UP AGAIN BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE. THIS ONE ATTACKED SARTRE DIRECTLY. SHE HAD RAISED HERSELF FROM THE WORKING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SHE SAID AND THE FIRST THING WORKERS DID WHO HAD RISEN LIKE THIS WAS TO WEAR A TIE.

THE NEXT DAY SARTRE WENT BACK BY TRAIN WITH ARLETTE WHO HAD ARRIVED SHORTLY BEFORE DINNER; AND I BY CAR WITH SYLVIE.

IN PARIS WE LEARNED OF THE MURDER OF OVERNEY. IT WAS THE TRAGIC END OF A LONG STORY. THERE HAD BEEN ARBITRARY DISMISSALS AT THE RENAULT WORKS DISMISSALS THAT HAD IN FACT A POLITICAL MOTIVE AND TWO OF THE WORKERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR JOBS THE TUNISIAN SADOK AND THE PORTUGUESE JOSÉ BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE; THE FRENCHMAN CHRISTIAN RISS JOINED THEM. THEY FOUND REFUGE IN A CHURCH IN THE RUE DU DÔME AT BOULOGNE. LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY 14 SARTRE WENT TO THE RENAULT WORKSHOPS ON THE ILE SEGUIN IN ORDER TO TALK WITH THE WORKERS. HE GOT IN SECRETLY BY MEANS OF A VAN TOGETHER WITH THE SINGER COLETTE MAGNY SOME MEMBERS OF THE GACEM ALI COMMITTEEH AND A FEW JOURNALISTS. THEY HANDED OUT TRACTS PROTESTING THE DISMISSAL OF MILITANT MAOISTS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WERE ON THE HUNGER STRIKE BUT THEY WERE BRUTALLY EXPELLED BY THE SECURITY MEN. SARTRE SPOKE ABOUT THE EVENT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE: “WE WENT TO RENAULT’S TO TALK TO THE WORKERS. SINCE RENAULT HAS BEEN NATIONALIZED ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK ABOUT THERE FREELY. WE WERE UNABLE TO SPEAK TO THE WORKERS. THAT PROVES THAT RENAULT EQUALS FASCISM. WHEN THE SECURITY MEN SAW THAT THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY WORKERS TO DEFEND US THEY GREW VIOLENT. SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE SAVAGELY STRUCK AND A WOMAN WAS THROWN DOWNSTAIRS.”

EVERY DAY SINCE THE END OF JANUARY MAOIST MILITANTS AT THE EMILE ZOLA GATE OF THE BILLANCOURT WORKS HAD BEEN DISTRIBUTING THE TRACTS OF THE COMITÉ DE LUTTE RENAULT. ON FEBRUARY 25 THEY CALLED FOR A DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE DISMISSALS AND AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT AND RACISM THAT EVENING AT CHARONNE. AMONG THEM WAS PIERRE OVERNEY WHO HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY RENAULT A YEAR EARLIER AND WHO NOW DROVE THE DELIVERY VAN FOR A LAUNDRY. THE EIGHT UNIFORMED SECURITY MEN GUARDING THE ENTRANCE WERE ON EDGE FOR IT WAS THE TIME WHEN THE WORKERS WERE BEGINNING TO COME OUT AND THE GATE WAS OPEN. THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN MAOISTS AND GUARDS AND THEN A SCUFFLE. A MAN IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES WAS WATCHING THE SCENE FROM A SENTRY BOX. AS THE MAOISTS MOVED FORWARD A FEW STEPS INTO THE WORKS HE SHOUTED “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE OR I’LL FIRE.” OVERNEY WHO WAS SIX FEET FROM HIM FELL BACK. TRAMONI PULLED THE TRIGGER; THE SHOT MISFIRED. HE PULLED IT AGAIN KILLING OVERNEY. THEN HE FLED INTO THE FACTORY.

AFTER THIS MURDER THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS AND OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF THE WORKERS AND FRESH DISMISSALS ON THE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT. SARTRE WENT TO CARRY OUT AN INQUIRY IN FRONT OF THE RENAULT WORKS. “YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN INQUIRY YOURSELF?” ASKED A JOURNALIST. “YOU DON’T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OFFICIAL JUSTICE?” “NO NONE AT ALL.” “AND WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNIST PARTY’S ATTITUDE?” “IT’S ABSURD. THEY TELL YOU ‘THE FACT THAT THEYI KILL ONE ANOTHER IS A PROOF THAT THEY’RE ACCOMPLICES.’ THAT SEEMS TO ME A PRETTY UNSOUND ARGUMENT. IT IS RATHER THE COMMUNISTS WHO ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE MAOISTS.”

ON FEBRUARY 28 MICHÈLE MANCEAUX DROVE SARTRE AND ME OVER TO JOIN IN A GREAT DEMONSTRATION ORGANIZED TO PROTEST AGAINST OVERNEY’S MURDER. THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS CROWD. WE DID NOT STAY LONG BECAUSE SARTRE HAD DIFFICULTY IN WALKING. I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO TO THE FUNERAL WITH HIM BECAUSE OF A MEETING OF CHOISIR.J WE WENT WITH MICHÈLE VIAN. HIS LEGS DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO FOLLOW THE COFFIN ALL THE WAY BUT HE WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE HUGE GATHERING. NEVER SINCE MAY 1968 HAD THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY LEFT WING BROUGHT SO MANY PEOPLE INTO THE STREETS OF PARIS. ACCORDING TO THE PAPERS THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THEY ALL SPOKE OF A REVIVAL OF LEFTISM AND EMPHASIZED ITS IMPORTANCE.

YET SARTRE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE KIDNAPPING OF NOGRETTE THE MAN IN CHARGE OF DISMISSALS AT RENAULT: THE NOUVELLE RÉSISTANCE POPULAIRE (N.R.P) HAD ABDUCTED HIM BY WAY OF RETALIATION A FEW DAYS AFTER THE MURDER. WITH CONSIDERABLE UNEASINESS HE WONDERED WHAT KIND OF A STATEMENT HE WOULD MAKE IF HE WERE EVER ASKED FOR ONE. THE KIDNAPPERS WERE UNEASY TOO. THEY QUICKLY RELEASED NOGRETTE WITHOUT HAVING MADE ANY CLAIM.

THE N.R.P WAS THE MILITANT SIDE OF THE GAUCHE PROLÉTARIENNE AND IT HAD SURVIVED IT BY GOING UNDERGROUND. AFTER THE KIDNAPPING OF NOGRETTE IT WAS AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS: EITHER IT MUST LAUNCH ITSELF WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO TERRORISM OR IT MUST CEASE TO EXIST. IT REVOLTED AGAINST TERRORISM AND CHOSE THE SECOND SOLUTION. A LITTLE LATER THIS BROUGHT ABOUT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SECOURS ROUGE; THE ORGANIZATION HAD IN FACT COME UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MAOISTS AND ONCE THEY HAD DECIDED TO DISPERSE THEY LOST ALL INTEREST IN IT.K

IT WAS AT THIS PERIOD THAT SARTRE WROTE A PREFACE FOR MICHÈLE MANCEAUX’S LES MAOS EN FRANCE A BOOK THAT CONTAINED HER INTERVIEWS WITH SOME OF THEIR LEADERS. IN THIS PREFACE HE EXPLAINED HOW HE LOOKED UPON THE MAOISTS AND THE REASONS FOR HIS AGREEMENT WITH THEM. “THE MAOISTS’ REGARD FOR SPONTANEITY” HE SAID “MEANS THAT REVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT ARISES FROM THE PEOPLE AND THAT THE PEOPLE ALONE CARRY IT INTO ITS FULL GROWTH AND EXTENT BY MEANS OF ACTION. THE PEOPLE DO NOT YET EXIST IN FRANCE BUT WHEREVER THE MASSES MOVE ON TO PRAXIS THEY ARE ALREADY THE PEOPLE …” HE PARTICULARLY STRESSED THE ETHICAL DIMENSION IN THE MAOIST ATTITUDE. “REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE IS IMMEDIATELY ETHICAL BECAUSE THE WORKERS BECOME THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR OWN HISTORY.” ACCORDING TO THE MAOISTS SAID SARTRE WHAT THE MASSES WANTED WAS FREEDOM AND IT WAS THIS DESIRE THAT TURNED THEIR ACTIONS INTO FESTIVITIES—THE SEQUESTRATION OF THE EMPLOYERS IN FACTORIES FOR EXAMPLE. THE WORKERS WERE TRYING TO BUILD UP AN ETHICAL SOCIETY THAT IS “ONE IN WHICH MAN SET FREE FROM HIS ALIENATION MAY DISCOVER HIMSELF IN HIS TRUE RELATION WITH THE GROUP.”

VIOLENCE SPONTANEITY MORALITY: THESE WERE THE THREE IMMEDIATE CHARACTERISTICS OF MAOIST REVOLUTIONARY ACTION. THEIR STRUGGLES WERE LESS AND LESS SYMBOLIC AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND MORE AND MORE REALISTIC. “WITH THEIR ANTIAUTHORITARIAN PRAXIS THE MAOISTS SHOW THEMSELVES AS THE ONLY REVOLUTIONARY FORCE CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO THE NEW FORMS OF THE CLASS WAR IN THE PERIOD OF ORGANIZED CAPITALISM.”

MEANWHILE ALTHOUGH HE REJECTED THE ROLE OF THE CLASSICAL INTELLECTUAL SARTRE HAD NOT GIVEN UP SIGNING MANIFESTOES WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO DO SO. AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH HE AND FOUCAULT CLAVEL CLAUDE MAURIAC AND DELEUZE LAUNCHED AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF THE CONGO.

IT WAS SPRING—A SUDDEN AND MAGNIFICENT SPRING. FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT THE SUN BECAME THE SUN OF SUMMER; BUDS OPENED THE TREES TURNED GREEN FLOWERS BLOOMED IN THE SQUARES AND BIRDS BURST INTO SONG; THERE WAS THE SMELL OF FRESH GRASS IN THE STREETS.

IN GENERAL WE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME AGREEABLE ROUTINE AS THAT OF THE YEAR BEFORE; WE SAW THE SAME FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WE LIKED BUT KNEW LESS WELL. WE LUNCHED WITH TITO GERASSI BACK FROM AMERICA AND HE GAVE US A LONG ACCOUNT OF THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS OF THE BLACK PANTHERS CLEAVER AND HUEY. IN SPITE OF HIS LIKING FOR CLEAVER—MORE INTELLIGENT LIVELIER—HE HAD A HIGHER OPINION OF HUEY’S SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. HE WOULD HAVE LIKED SARTRE TO SUPPORT HIM BUT REALIZING THAT HE DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT SARTRE WOULD NOT TAKE SIDES.

WE ALSO LUNCHED WITH TODD WHO AFTER A LONG SEARCH HAD FOUND HIS FATHER AGAIN. IT APPEARED THAT FOR HIM THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT. SINCE HE HAD LEFT HIS WIFE NIZAN’S DAUGHTER WHOM WE WERE VERY FOND OF WE HAD SEEN SCARCELY ANYTHING OF HIM. AS HE WAS PERPETUALLY LOOKING FOR A FATHER SARTRE WHOSE DEEP BENEVOLENCE OFTEN TOOK THE FORM OF EASY KINDNESS DEDICATED A BOOK TO HIM—“FOR MY REBEL SON.” BUT IN FACT SARTRE HAD NEVER HAD THE LEAST NOTION OF HAVING A SON. HE SAID TO CONTAT IN “SELF-PORTRAIT AT SEVENTY” “I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO HAVE A SON NEVER; AND IN MY CONTACTS WITH MEN YOUNGER THAN MYSELF I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PATERNAL RELATIONSHIP.”L

AT SAINT-PAUL-DE-VENCE WITH SYLVIE AND ARLETTE WE LED MUCH THE SAME LIFE AS WE HAD THE YEAR BEFORE. WE READ WE WENT FOR WALKS UNDER A MAGNIFICENT BLUE SKY AND WE LISTENED TO FRANCE-MUSIQUE ON OUR TRANSISTOR. WE REVISITED CAGNES AND THE MAEGHT GALLERY. SARTRE SEEMED VERY HAPPY.

BACK IN PARIS HE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO HIS MILITANT ACTIVITIES. AT THAT TIME THERE WERE 165000 UNOCCUPIED DWELLINGS IN GREATER PARIS. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE GOUTTE D’OR QUARTER WERE ALMOST ALL IMMIGRANTS FROM NORTH AFRICA. SOME OF THEM HAD OCCUPIED ONE OF THESE HOUSES ON THE BOULEVARD DE LA CHAPELLE. THEY STAYED THERE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE POLICE SURROUNDED THE BUILDING. THE BESIEGED SQUATTERS RETREATED TO THE TOP FLOOR. THE COPS BROUGHT A LONG LADDER AND BROKE EVERY WINDOW IN THE PLACE COMPELLING ALL THE SQUATTERS TO LEAVE. THE MEN WERE TAKEN TO AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO AN OFFICIAL CENTER.

BY WAY OF PROTEST SECOURS ROUGE ORGANIZED A PRESS CONFERENCE DIRECTED BY ROLAND CASTRO. CLAUDE MAURIAC FAYE AND JAUBERT WERE THERE AND SARTRE ALSO TOOK PART. HE SUMMED UP ALL THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT SINCE THE DJELALLI AFFAIR AND BROUGHT OUT THEIR POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE. HE DENOUNCED “WHAT IN THIS CASE MUST BE CALLED THE ENEMY” THAT IS THE FORCES OF ORDER AGAINST WHOM THESE ACTIONS HAD BEEN DIRECTED. IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID THESE DWELLINGS ARE UNINHABITABLE; ONE REALLY HAD TO BE QUITE HOMELESS TO PUT UP WITH THEM. SECOND EXPELLING THE UNFORTUNATE OCCUPANTS WAS EVIDENCE OF A HIGH DEGREE OF RACISM—THE DJELALLI FAMILY FOR EXAMPLE HAD NOT FOUND A DECENT APARTMENT. AND THAT WAS WHY POOR PEOPLE WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THAT WRETCHED HOVEL. IT HAD BEEN BOUGHT BY A COMPANY THAT INTENDED TO RAZE IT ONE DAY IN ORDER TO PUT UP AN APARTMENT BUILDING—AN INHUMAN UNDERTAKING THAT THE LOCAL POPULATION REACTED AGAINST SPONTANEOUSLY. ONCE AGAIN WE WERE IN THE REGION OF CLASS WARFARE. IT WAS CAPITALISM THAT WE WERE UP AGAINST. “AND YOU WILL OBSERVE” HE ADDED “THAT WHEN THE POLICE CLEAR THE SQUATTERS OUT THEY DESTROY HOUSES THAT CAN STILL BE USED.”

SARTRE WAS INTERESTED IN CONCERNS THAT VARIED WIDELY BUT THAT WERE IN HIS OPINION ALL INTERCONNECTED. IN APRIL HE PROVIDED A PREFACE IN THE FORM OF A LETTER TO A WORK ON MENTAL ILLNESS WRITTEN BY THE MEMBERS OF THE HEIDELBERG SOCIETY OF PATIENTS. HE CONGRATULATED THEM ON HAVING CARRIED INTO PRACTICE “THE ONLY POSSIBLE RADICALIZATION OF ANTIPSYCHIATRY” ON THE BASIS OF THE IDEA THAT “ILLNESS IS CAPITALISM’S ONLY POSSIBLE FORM OF LIFE” SINCE ALIENATION IN THE MARXIST SENSE FINDS ITS TRUEST EXPRESSION IN MENTAL ALIENATION AND THE REPRESSION THAT SANCTIONS IT.

AS USUAL THE WAY WE BEST LIKED SPENDING OUR FREE TIME WAS SEEING FRIENDS. THAT SPRING WE HAD LUNCH WITH THE CATHALAS.M THEY TOLD US THAT IN THE USSR THE INTELLECTUALS’ SITUATION WAS WORSE THAN EVER. FOUR YEARS EARLIER CATHALA HAD PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN LE MONDE ON THE LATEST NOVEL BY CHAKOVSKY THE EDITOR OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERARY WEEKLY IN MOSCOW. CATHALA HAD TRANSLATED IT HIMSELF AND HE STATED THAT THE BOOK WAS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY BAD BUT THAT IT WAS STALINIST TOO. NO MORE TRANSLATIONS WERE OFFERED HIM IN MOSCOW. HE LIVED BY TRANSLATING ONE OF ALEXIS TOLSTOY’S BOOKS FOR A FRENCH PUBLISHER. HIS WIFE LUCIA HAD BEEN REFUSED A VISA FOR FRANCE UNLESS SHE WOULD DECLARE THAT SHE DID NOT SHARE HER HUSBAND’S VIEWS. THAT WAS WHY THEY HAD NOT BEEN TO FRANCE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IN THE END SHE HAD LOST HER JOB AND NOW SHE WAS UNEMPLOYED BUT THANKS TO THE FRENCH EMBASSY SHE HAD OBTAINED A PASSPORT. THEY INTENDED TO COME BACK TO PARIS FOR GOOD IN A YEAR’S TIME. SOLZHENITSYN WAS IN WORSE ODOR THAN EVER BECAUSE OF HIS LATEST BOOK WHICH WAS TO APPEAR IN FRANCE BUT NOT IN THE USSR.

ONCE AGAIN SARTRE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIS TEETH. THE DENTIST TOLD HIM THAT IN OCTOBER HE WOULD HAVE TO FIT HIM WITH A REAL PLATE AND THAT IT WOULD MAKE SPEAKING IN PUBLIC DIFFICULT. SARTRE WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED. IF HE COULD NO LONGER SPEAK AT BIG MEETINGS OR EVEN IN GATHERINGS OF A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEN HE WOULD BE FORCED TO RETIRE FROM POLITICAL LIFE. HE ALSO COMPLAINED OF LOSING HIS MEMORY WHICH WAS TRUE FOR SOME LITTLE THINGS. BUT THE FEAR OF DEATH DID NOT TOUCH HIM AT ALL. BOST WHOSE ELDER BROTHER PIERRE WAS DYING ASKED HIM WHETHER HE EVER FELT IT. “YES SOMETIMES” SAID SARTRE. “ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS WHEN I AM GOING TO SEE THE CASTOR AND SYLVIE IN THE EVENING I TELL MYSELF THAT IT WOULD BE STUPID TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.” BY ACCIDENT HE MEANT A STROKE. THE NEXT DAY I ASKED HIM “WHY SATURDAY?” HE REPLIED THAT THE ONLY TWO TIMES IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF DEATH BUT ONLY OF BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS EVENING.

HE GAVE GOYTISOLO AN INTERVIEW FOR LIBRE A SPANISH-LANGUAGE MAGAZINE PUBLISHED IN PARIS IN WHICH HE ANALYZED THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS THAT AROSE IN 1972 AND RETURNED TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUALS. IN MAY WRITING IN LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE HE DEALT WITH VIEWS ON PEOPLE’S JUSTICE AT GREATER LENGTH.

LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE WAS NOT DOING WELL AT ALL; IT EVEN SUSPENDED PUBLICATION. EVERY MORNING SARTRE ATTENDED THE MEETINGS AT WHICH THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE PAPER DISCUSSED WAYS OF SAVING IT. HE WOKE VERY EARLY AND HE GREW VERY TIRED. IN THE EVENING LISTENING TO MUSIC HE WOULD DROP OFF TO SLEEP. ONCE AFTER NO MORE THAN A SINGLE GLASS OF WHISKEY HE BEGAN TO TALK NONSENSE AND STAGGERED AS HE WENT UP TO BED. THE NEXT DAY HE GOT UP BY HIMSELF AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND HE SEEMED PERFECTLY NORMAL. STILL IN THE PLANE THAT WAS TAKING ME TO GRENOBLE TO GIVE A LECTURE FOR CHOISIR I FELT ANXIOUS; WHEN I CAME BACK TO PARIS THE NEXT DAY I EXPECTED BAD NEWS. AND INDEED AT HALF PAST ELEVEN ARLETTE TELEPHONED ME. SHE TOO HAD BEEN AWAY FROM PARIS LATE ON THURSDAY AND SARTRE HAD SPENT THE EVENING ALONE IN HER APARTMENT TO WATCH TELEVISION (HE HAD NO SET AT HOME). WHEN PUIG CAME TO HER PLACE A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE FOUND SARTRE LYING ON THE FLOOR DRUNK. IT HAD TAKEN PUIG HALF AN HOUR TO GET HIM TO STAND UP. THEN HE WALKED BACK WITH HIM. SARTRE LIVED NOT FAR AWAY BUT HE FELL AND BLOODIED HIS NOSE. IN THE MORNING HE TELEPHONED ARLETTE AND HIS MIND SEEMED CLEAR. I WENT TO SEE HIM AT ABOUT TWO. HE HAD SCRAPED HIS NOSE AND HIS LIPS WERE RATHER SWOLLEN BUT HIS WITS WERE IN ORDER. AT MY URGING HE PROMISED TO GO AND SEE ZAIDMANN ON MONDAY. WE HAD LUNCH AT LA COUPOLE WHERE MICHÈLE JOINED HIM FOR COFFEE. I WENT BACK TO HIS APARTMENT AND FROM THERE I TELEPHONED ZAIDMANN. HE SAID THAT SARTRE SHOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL MONDAY BUT COME IMMEDIATELY. I WENT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT. AFTER A LITTLE GRUMBLING SARTRE WENT OFF TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH MICHÈLE AND CAME BACK ABOUT SIX. HIS REFLEXES WERE GOOD; THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG EXCEPT FOR HIS BLOOD PRESSURE—210. BUT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF HIS DRUNKEN NIGHT. ZAIDMANN HAD PRESCRIBED THE SAME MEDICINE AS BEFORE AND HAD GIVEN HIM AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY.

SATURDAY EVENING WITH SYLVIE WAS DELIGHTFUL. SARTRE DID NOT BEGIN TO FEEL VERY DROWSY UNTIL MIDNIGHT THEN HE SLEPT UNTIL HALF PAST NINE WITHOUT A BREAK AND WOKE UP FEELING WELL AND IN GOOD SPIRITS. JUNE ENDED VERY WELL. LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE CAME OUT AGAIN AND THE FIRST NEW ISSUE WAS A SUCCESS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY SARTRE WENT OFF WITH ARLETTE FOR A BRIEF STAY IN AUSTRIA. I TRAVELED IN BELGIUM HOLLAND AND SWITZERLAND WITH SYLVIE. SARTRE SENT ME TELEGRAMS WE TELEPHONED ONE ANOTHER AND HIS HEALTH SEEMED EXCELLENT. IN ROME ON AUGUST 12 I WENT TO FETCH HIM AT THE STATION BUT I MISSED HIM. I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED IN A TAXI. HIS SPEECH WAS BLURRED BUT HE SAID AT ONCE “IT’LL BE ALL RIGHT IN A MINUTE.” HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BEING ALONE TO DRINK TWO HALF-BOTTLES OF WINE IN THE RESTAURANT CAR. HE GOT OVER IT QUICKLY BUT I DID WONDER WHY HE WAS LIKE THIS—WHY HE DRANK TOO MUCH WHENEVER HE COULD. “IT’S PLEASANT” HE SAID BUT THE ANSWER DID NOT SATISFY ME. I SUPPOSED THAT THE REASON HE ESCAPED FROM HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WAS THAT HE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH HIS WORK. IN THE FOURTH VOLUME OF THE FAMILY IDIOT HE INTENDED TO STUDY MADAME BOVARY; AND SINCE HE WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO EXTEND HIS RANGE HE WISHED TO USE STRUCTURALIST METHODS. BUT HE DID NOT LIKE STRUCTURALISM. HE GAVE HIS REASONS: “THE SPECIALISTS IN LINGUISTICS TRY TO TREAT LANGUAGE FROM WITHOUT AND THE STRUCTURALISTS WHO BASE THEMSELVES ON LINGUISTICS ALSO DEAL WITH A WHOLE FROM OUTSIDE; FOR THEM IT IS A MATTER OF CARRYING CONCEPTS TO THEIR UTMOST LIMIT. BUT I CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE I SET MYSELF NOT ON A SCIENTIFIC BUT A PHILOSOPHIC PLANE AND THAT IS WHY I DO NOT NEED TO EXTERIORIZE WHAT IS ENTIRE.” SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HIS PLAN WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM. AND PERHAPS HE ALSO REALIZED THAT IN THEMSELVES THE FIRST THREE VOLUMES OF THE FAMILY IDIOT CONTAINED THE IMPLICIT EXPLANATION OF MADAME BOVARY AND THAT BY NOW TRYING TO WORK BACK FROM THE BOOK TO ITS AUTHOR HE RAN THE RISK OF REPEATING HIMSELF. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT; HE MADE NOTES; BUT HE DID NOT POSSESS A GENERAL COMPREHENSIVE IDEA OF WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. AND HE DID NOT WORK MUCH: HE LACKED ENTHUSIASM. IN 1975 HE SAID TO MICHEL CONTAT “I FOUND THIS FOURTH VOLUME BOTH THE HARDEST AND FOR ME THE LEAST INTERESTING.”

YET FOR ALL THAT WE HAD A PLEASANT VACATION FIRST WITH SYLVIE AND THEN BY OURSELVES. DURING JUNE SARTRE HAD SOMETIMES BEEN RATHER ABSENT-MINDED RATHER REMOTE; IN ROME NOT AT ALL. WE STILL HAD THAT TERRACED APARTMENT THAT DELIGHTED US SO. AND AS WE ALWAYS DID WE TALKED WE READ WE LISTENED TO MUSIC. I DO NOT KNOW WHY BUT THAT YEAR WE TOOK TO PLAYING DRAUGHTS AND QUICKLY WE BECAME PASSIONATELY FOND OF IT.

WHEN WE CAME BACK AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER SARTRE WAS IN GREAT FORM. “I LIKE BEING BACK HERE” HE SAID TO ME. RETURNING TO MY APARTMENT PLEASED HIM. “AS FAR AS THE REST IS CONCERNED I DON’T CARE. BUT I’M GLAD TO BE IN THIS PLACE AGAIN.” WE SPENT SOME HAPPY EVENINGS THERE AND AGAIN I ALMOST STOPPED WORRYING.

BUT NOT FOR LONG. IN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER I ONCE MORE BECAME AWARE OF THE IRREVERSIBLE DETERIORATION OF OLD AGE. IN ROME I HAD NOTICED THAT WHEN WE WENT AFTER LUNCH TO EAT GIOLITTI’S WONDERFUL ICES SARTRE WOULD HURRY TO THE LAVATORY. ONE AFTERNOON WHEN WE WERE GOING ALONG BY THE PANTHEON BACK TOWARD THE HOTEL AND HE WAS WALKING VERY QUICKLY AHEAD OF US HE STOPPED AND SAID “CATS HAVE JUST PISSED ON ME. I WENT CLOSE TO THE BALUSTRADE AND I WAS WET ON.” SYLVIE BELIEVED HIM AND LAUGHED ABOUT IT. FOR MY PART I KNEW WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT I SAID NOTHING. IN PARIS AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER SARTRE GOT UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM—HE WAS IN MY APARTMENT—AND THERE WAS A MARK ON HIS CHAIR. THE NEXT DAY I TOLD SYLVIE THAT HE HAD SPILLED SOME TEA. “YOU WOULD SAY THAT A CHILD HAD HAD AN ACCIDENT” SHE OBSERVED. THE NEXT EVENING IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS ANOTHER MARK. SO I SPOKE TO SARTRE ABOUT IT. “YOU ARE INCONTINENT. YOU OUGHT TO TELL THE DOCTOR.” TO MY UTTER ASTONISHMENT HE REPLIED IN A PERFECTLY NATURAL VOICE “I HAVE TOLD HIM. IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG WHILE NOW. IT’S THOSE CELLS THAT I LOST.” SARTRE HAD ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY PURITANICAL; HE NEVER REFERRED TO HIS NATURAL FUNCTIONS AND HE CARRIED THEM OUT WITH THE UTMOST DISCRETION. THAT WAS WHY I ASKED HIM THE NEXT MORNING WHETHER HE DID NOT FIND THIS LACK OF CONTROL EXCEEDINGLY EMBARRASSING. HE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE “WHEN YOU’RE OLD YOU CAN’T EXPECT TOO MUCH YOUR CLAIMS HAVE TO BE MODEST.” I WAS TOUCHED BY HIS SIMPLICITY AND BY THIS MODERATION SO NEW IN HIM; AND AT THE SAME TIME HIS LACK OF AGGRESSIVENESS AND HIS RESIGNATION WOUNDED ME.

IN FACT HIS CHIEF WORRY AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME WAS HIS TEETH. HE OFTEN HAD ABSCESSES AND THEY GAVE HIM MUCH PAIN. HE ATE ONLY SOFT THINGS AND HE COULD NO LONGER AVOID HAVING A PLATE. THE DAY BEFORE THE DENTIST WAS TO FINISH TAKING OUT ALL THE TEETH OF HIS UPPER JAW HE SAID “I’VE HAD A SAD DAY. I WAS DEPRESSED. THERE WAS THIS ODIOUS WEATHER. AND THEN MY TEETH.…” I DID NOT PUT ON ANY RECORDS THAT EVENING; I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD BROOD. WE LOOKED AT MY DAY’S LETTERS AND PLAYED DRAUGHTS. BY NOON THE NEXT DAY ALL HIS UPPER TEETH HAD VANISHED. HE CAME TO MY PLACE AND HE WAS ASHAMED OF BEING SEEN IN THE STREET. IN FACT WITH HIS MOUTH SHUT HE WAS MUCH LESS DISFIGURED THAN WHEN HE HAD AN ABSCESS. FOR LUNCH I GAVE HIM MASHED POTATOES BRANDADE AND STEWED APPLES. THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE DENTIST FITTED HIS PLATE TELLING HIM THAT FOR A WEEK HE WOULD NO DOUBT FIND IT SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THAT HE WOULD BE FREE OF ALL THOSE INFECTIONS THAT HAD TORMENTED HIM BEFORE. SARTRE WAS RELIEVED TO KNOW THAT THE PROCESS WAS UNDERWAY AND WAS DISTINCTLY LESS GLOOMY THAN HE HAD BEEN THE EVENING BEFORE.

TWO DAYS LATER HE CAME HOME AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE IN HIGH SPIRITS. HIS NEW TEETH DID NOT BOTHER HIM AT ALL—NO DIFFICULTY IN SPEAKING AND HE CHEWED BETTER THAN BEFORE. LATER WHEN HE CAME TO MY APARTMENT ABOUT MIDNIGHT I ASKED HIM HOW THE EVENING HAD GONE—AN EVENING THAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO BE BORING. “IT WAS DEADLY DULL” HE SAID. “BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING BUT MY TEETH AND I WAS SO PLEASED!”

AT ONCE HE WAS GAYER AND MORE FULL OF LIFE THAN EVER. ON NOVEMBER 26 WE WATCHED THE SHOWING OF THE FILM ABOUT HIM AND JUST AS HE APPEARED ON THE SCREEN SO HE WAS IN LIFE; THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE SEEMED TO ME TO BE OVERFLOWING WITH YOUTH. (WHAT WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT SARTRE AND SO DISCONCERTING FOR THOSE AROUND HIM WAS THAT HE COULD EMERGE CHEERFUL AND INTACT FROM THE BOTTOM OF ABYSSES THAT SEEMED TO HAVE SWALLOWED HIM FOREVER. I HAD WEPT OVER HIM FOR A WHOLE SUMMER AND YET HE HAD RETURNED ENTIRELY TO HIS FORMER STATE WHOLLY HIMSELF AGAIN AS THOUGH “THE WING OF WEAKNESS” HAD NEVER BRUSHED HIM. THESE RESURRECTIONS THIS RETURNING FROM LIMBO EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT LATER ON I COULD SAY FROM ONE PAGE TO ANOTHER “HE WAS VERY ILL. HE WAS VERY WELL.” HE POSSESSED A FUND OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT RESISTED ALL ATTACKS UNTIL HIS LAST HOURS.)

HE WAS STILL BUSY WITH LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE. IN OCTOBER HE AND HIS FRIENDS WHO WORKED ON THE PAPER WROTE A PIECE “WE ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC” WHICH WAS DISTRIBUTED IN THE FORM OF POSTERS AND REPRODUCED IN THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE TWENTY-NINTH ISSUE OF THE PAPER. IN DECEMBER TOGETHER WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SIX OTHER INTELLECTUALS HE SIGNED AN APPEAL CALLED “THE NEW RACISM” THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE AND IN THE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. IT WAS ALSO LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE ON DECEMBER 22 THAT PRINTED HIS INTERVIEW WITH ARANDA. ARANDA A TECHNICAL COUNSELOR TO THE MINISTER OF EQUIPMENT HAD PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS IN LE CANARD ENCHAÎNÉ PROVING FRAUD AND CORRUPT USE OF INFLUENCE ON THE PART OF CERTAIN IMPORTANT PEOPLE BELONGING TO THE GOVERNMENT. HE HANDED THE RELEVANT FILES OVER TO THE LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON CHARGED. HIS CHARACTER INTRIGUED SARTRE WHO SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. ARANDA AGREED; AND SARTRE TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM THAT BY DENOUNCING THE MISDEEDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION HE WAS ATTACKING THE STATE AND THAT IN ORDER TO PREVENT MALPRACTICE A “GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED AND SUPERVISED BY A PEOPLE CAPABLE OF REFUSING ANY SUCH UNJUST ACTS” SHOULD BE SET UP. ARANDA WAS DEEPLY WOUNDED BECAUSE POMPIDOU WAS TRYING TO STIFLE THE AFFAIR BUT EVEN SO HE RECOILED FROM CALLING THE STATE INTO QUESTION AND SPOKE OF THE WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE. SARTRE MAINTAINED THAT WHETHER HE LIKED IT OR NOT IN HIS WAY ARANDA WAS “AN AGENT OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY.”

IN NOVEMBER HE EMBARKED UPON AN UNDERTAKING THAT ATTRACTED HIM VERY MUCH—A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH TWO LEFTIST FRIENDS PIERRE VICTOR AND PHILIPPE GAVI. IN THESE HE WOULD TAKE STOCK OF HIS POLITICAL PROGRESS AND WOULD ATTEMPT TO DEFINE LEFTIST THOUGHT AS IT HAD DEVELOPED SINCE 1968. THE WHOLE WOULD BE PUBLISHED UNDER THE TITLE ON A RAISON DE SE REVOLTER (TO REBEL IS JUSTIFIED).

GEISMAR HAD INTRODUCED HIS INTERLOCUTORS TO HIM TWO YEARS BEFORE. PIERRE VICTOR—BENNI LÉVI WAS HIS REAL NAME—WAS A YOUNG EGYPTIAN JEW WHO HAD STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AND WHO HAD BEEN TO THE ECOLE NORMALE. HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE MARXIST-LENINIST MOVEMENT; THEN WITH GEISMAR HE HAD LED THE G.P. UNTIL IT WAS DISSOLVED. HE HAD ALREADY HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH SARTRE WHO HAD A VERY HIGH OPINION OF HIM AND WHO WAS CHARMED BY HIS YOUTH AND HIS MILITANTISM. HE SPOKE ABOUT THIS IN 1977 IN A DIALOGUE WITH VICTOR THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN LIBÉRATION:

SARTRE: I LUNCHED WITH YOU ONE DAY IN THE SPRING OF 1970.

VICTOR: WHAT KIND OF PERSON DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MEET?

SARTRE: AN ODD CHARACTER WHOM I THOUGHT OF AS BEING SOMETHING OF A MILORD I’ARSOUILLE.… AFTER WHAT I HAD BEEN TOLD I WAS QUITE CURIOUS TO SEE YOU THAT MORNING.… A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER.

VICTOR: NOW YOU SEE ME AS I AM …

SARTRE: I SEE YOU; AND WHAT PLEASED ME AT ONCE WAS THAT YOU SEEMED TO ME MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MOST OF THE POLITICIANS I HAD MET UP UNTIL THEN ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNISTS AND MUCH FREER. I INSIST ON THE POINT: YOU DIDN’T REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT SUBJECTS LESS WHOLLY POLITICAL. IN A WORD YOU HAD THAT WAY OF CONVERSING OUTSIDE THE MAIN SUBJECT WHICH I LIKE IN WOMEN—TALKING ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING WHICH ONE RARELY DOES WITH MEN.

VICTOR: YOU DIDN’T SEE ME WHOLLY AS A LEADER NOR JUST AS A GUY.

SARTRE: YET YOU WERE JUST A GUY; BUT A GUY WHO HAD SOME FEMININE QUALITIES. I LIKED YOU FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW.

VICTOR: WHEN DID YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN A THEORETICAL FUNDAMENTAL DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE TWO OF US?

SARTRE: THAT CAME ABOUT LITTLE BY LITTLE.… I HAD A RELATION WITH YOU THAT GRADUALLY CHANGED ITS NATURE.… THERE WAS REAL FREEDOM BETWEEN US—THE FREEDOM OF ENDANGERING ONE’S POSITION.

GAVI WAS A YOUNG JOURNALIST WHO HAD WRITTEN SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR LES TEMPS MODERNES. HE BELONGED TO V.L.R. (VIVE LA RÉVOLUTION)—A LESS DOGMATIC MORE ANARCHIST MOVEMENT THAN MAOISM—WHOSE PAPER TOUT SARTRE HAD EDITED FOR A WHILE. SARTRE WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AS WELL. AND HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE IDEA OF GIVING HIS RELATIONS WITH THE MAOISTS CONCRETE FORM IN A BOOK SINCE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEM THAT HE HAD RENEWED HIS POLITICAL THOUGHT. WITH A HAPPY LOOK HE TOLD BOST AND ME ONE EVENING THAT HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH THEM HAD MADE HIM FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. HE WAS ONLY SORRY THAT HE WAS SOMEWHAT TOO OLD FOR IT TO BE ENTIRELY PROFITABLE. HE SAID IN THE COURSE OF ONE OF HIS FIRST CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR IN DECEMBER 1972:

“NINETEEN SIXTY-EIGHT CAME RATHER LATE FOR ME. IF IT HAD HAPPENED WHEN I WAS FIFTY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.… FOR A WELL-KNOWN INTELLECTUAL TO CARRY OUT ALL THAT CAN BE REQUIRED OF HIM CARRY IT THROUGH TO THE END HE HAS TO BE BETWEEN FORTY-FIVE AND FIFTY. I CAN’T LAST TO THE END OF A DEMONSTRATION FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE I HAVE A LEG THAT NO LONGER WORKS. AT OVERNEY’S FUNERAL FOR INSTANCE I COULD ONLY GO PART OF THE WAY.…

“I HAVE STATED THE OBJECTIVE REASONS WHY I AM WITH YOU AND I SHALL STATE THEM AGAIN. ONE OF THE SUBJECTIVE REASONS IS THAT THE MAOISTS’ DEMANDS MAKE ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.… THE ONLY TROUBLE IS IF YOU GO ON MIXING WITH POLITICALLY ACTIVE PEOPLE AFTER YOU’RE SEVENTY YOU ARE TAKEN THERE IN A CAR WITH A FOLDING CHAIR. YOU ARE A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY AND AGE TURNS YOU INTO A MERE IMAGE.… I SAY THIS WITHOUT SADNESS; I’VE HAD A WELL-FILLED LIFE AND I’M SATISFIED.…

“AND I’M SATISFIED WITH YOUR RELATIONS WITH ME. OF COURSE I EXIST FOR YOU ONLY INSOFAR AS I AM USEFUL TO YOU. I FULLY APPROVE OF THAT. BUT WHEN IT’S A QUESTION OF CARRYING OUT AN ACTION TOGETHER FRIENDSHIP COMES INTO IT THAT IS A RELATION THAT GOES BEYOND THE ACTION UNDERTAKEN A RELATION OF RECIPROCITY.… THAT’S THE UNDERLYING SIGNIFICANCE OF MY RELATIONS WITH YOU. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU CALL ME INTO QUESTION AND I ARGUE WITH MYSELF IN ORDER TO BE ON YOUR SIDE THEN AS FAR AS MY ABILITIES GO I AM HELPING TO CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH THERE WILL STILL BE PHILOSOPHERS MEN OF A NEW KIND WORKER-INTELLECTUALS; BUT MEN WHO WILL ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION ‘WHAT IS MAN?’ ”

THE ONLY INCONVENIENCE ABOUT THESE MEETINGS WAS THAT IN ORDER TO CARRY ON UNTIL TWO O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON VICTOR AND GAVI ATE SANDWICHES AND DRANK RED WINE; SARTRE WHO LUNCHED LATER DRANK SOME TOO BUT WITHOUT EATING. NO DOUBT THAT WAS WHY HE WAS OFTEN OUT OF FORM AND DROWSY IN THE EVENING. IN JANUARY LILIANE SIEGEL WHO WAS A FRIEND OF THEIRS ASKED VICTOR AND GAVI TO SEE THAT SARTRE DRANK LESS THOUGH WITHOUT HIS NOTICING IT. THIS THEY DID AND IN JANUARY SARTRE STOPPED BEING DROWSY.

VICTOR AND GAVI WERE EXTREMELY EXCITED BY A PLAN THAT ALSO INTERESTED SARTRE TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE—THE LAUNCHING OF A PAPER THAT WAS TO BE CALLED LIBÉRATION. ON DECEMBER 6 AT THE NEW OFFICES OF THE AGENCE DE PRESSE LIBÉRATION 14 RUE DE BRETAGNE THERE WAS A PREPARATORY MEETING WHICH SARTRE ATTENDED. GAVI SET OUT THE PROGRAM OF THE PAPER WHICH WAS TO APPEAR IN FEBRUARY. SARTRE SPOKE OF THE PART HE INTENDED TO PLAY: “WHENEVER I AM ASKED FOR ARTICLES I SHALL WRITE THEM.” HE ALSO BLAMED LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE FOR THE HEADLINE IN ITS LAST ISSUE “THE GUILLOTINE BUT FOR TOUVIER.”N OF COURSE IT WAS UNTHINKABLE THAT TOUVIER SHOULD HAVE BEEN LET OUT. BUT HE HAD BEEN SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT NOT TO DEATH AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO DEMAND THAT HE SHOULD BE GUILLOTINED.

1973
THERE WAS ANOTHER PREPARATORY MEETING ON JANUARY 4. AND ON FEBRUARY 7 1973 SARTRE AGREED TO BE INTERVIEWED BY JACQUES CHANCEL IN THE TELEVISION SERIES RADIOSCOPIE IN ORDER TO PRESENT LIBÉRATION. CHANCEL TRIED TO MAKE HIM TALK ABOUT HIS LIFE AND HIS BOOKS WHICH WOULD HAVE SUITED THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. SARTRE ELUDED HIM AND BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE ONLY SUBJECT THAT INTERESTED HIM—LIBÉRATION. A LITTLE LATER AND STILL TO MAKE THE PAPER KNOWN HE WENT TO A RALLY IN LYONS COMING BACK QUITE PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS. I WENT WITH HIM TO ANOTHER MEETING AT LILLE. IT WAS HELD IN AN IMMENSE HALL GIVING ON TO THE MAIN SQUARE. A CONSIDERABLE CROWD WAS PRESENT MOST OF THEM YOUNG. SARTRE AND TWO OTHER SPEAKERS EXPLAINED WHAT LIBÉRATION INTENDED TO BE. THE AUDIENCE EAGERLY TOOK PART IN THE DISCUSSION AND POINTED OUT VARIOUS SCANDALS DEMANDING THAT LIBÉRATION DENOUNCE THEM.

AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY LIBÉRATION WAS LAUNCHED AT ITS OFFICES NEAR THE PORTE DE PANTIN. SARTRE HAD SENT OUT EIGHTY INVITATIONS AND A COPIOUS BUFFET HAD BEEN PROVIDED BUT—AND WE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY—ALMOST NOBODY CAME. THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE WERE THOSE WHO WORKED ON THE PAPER. TOWARD SEVEN O’CLOCK CUNY BLAIN AND MOULOUDJI PUT IN AN APPEARANCE.

SARTRE HAD A GREAT MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES. IN JANUARY 1973 REFERRING TO PRISONS HE PUT OUT A MESSAGE THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN LE MONDE ON “THIS RÉGIME THAT KEEPS US ALL IN A CONCENTRATION-CAMP WORLD.” HE GAVE THE BELGIAN MAGAZINE PRO JUSTITIA AN INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE SPOKE OF THE ARANDA CASE OF THE BRUAY-EN-ARTOIS AFFAIR OF MICHEL FOUCAULT’S POSITIONS AND OF JUSTICE IN CHINA. HE WROTE A PREFACE FOR OLIVIER TODD’S BOOK LES PAUMÉSO WHICH WAS A REPRINTING OF UNE DEMICAMPAGNE PUBLISHED BY JULLIARD IN 1957.

HE GAVE M.-A. BURNIER AN INTERVIEW THAT APPEARED IN ACTUEL IN FEBRUARY 1973—“SARTRE ON THE MAOISTS.” HE ANALYZED HIS POLITICAL ACTION SINCE MAY 1968 PARTICULARLY HIS COMMITMENT TO LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE: “I BELIEVE IN ILLEGALITY” HE SAID. HE STILL PAID GREAT ATTENTION TO LES TEMPS MODERNES IN WHOSE JANUARY ISSUE HE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE “ELECTIONS A TRAP FOR FOOLS.” IN THIS HE REFUSED THE SYSTEM OF INDIRECT DEMOCRACY THAT DELIBERATELY REDUCED US TO POWERLESSNESS—IT WAS A SYSTEM THAT ATOMIZED THE ELECTORS REDUCING THEM TO MERE CIPHERS. ALL THE ARTICLES IN THIS NUMBER HAD THE SAME GENERAL DRIFT AND THEY WERE EVIDENCE OF THE TEAM’S POLITICAL UNITY. THE ISSUE WAS A GREAT SUCCESS WITH THE READERS AND SARTRE WAS THOROUGHLY SATISFIED. HE RETURNED TO HIS ANALYSIS OF FRENCH POLITICS IN AN INTERVIEW HE GAVE TO DER SPIEGEL IN FEBRUARY.

IN THAT SAME MONTH HE AND THE LIBÉRATION JOURNALISTS WENT TO INVESTIGATE THE GREAT HOUSING COMPLEXES OF VILLENEUVE-LA-GARENNE. HE DID NOT THINK THE EXPEDITION VERY PROFITABLE. IT WAS THE OCCASION FOR A DISCUSSION THAT LIBÉRATION PUBLISHED IN JUNE A DISCUSSION IN WHICH A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE SPOKE BUT IN WHICH SARTRE WHO WAS PRESENT REMAINED SILENT.

AT THE END OF FEBRUARY HE HAD BRONCHITIS. HE SOON RECOVERED BUT IT LEFT HIM RATHER FATIGUED. ON SUNDAY MARCH 4 THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS WAS HELD. LIBÉRATION HAD ASKED HIM FOR AN ARTICLE ON THE SUBJECT AND THAT EVENING MICHÈLE VIAN AND I WENT TO THE EDITORIAL OFFICE WITH HIM. A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE AND EVERYONE FOLLOWED THE RESULTS AMID THE NOISE OF THE RADIO AND THE ARGUMENTS. SITTING AT THE CORNER OF A TABLE SARTRE WROTE AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE FOR THE FIRST NUMBER. HE WAS PROUD OF HAVING WRITTEN IT SO FAST AND EFFICIENTLY IN SPITE OF THE DIN. FOR MY PART I WAS WORRIED. THE EVENING HAD BEEN VERY TRYING FOR HIM. THE NEXT DAY HE LUNCHED AT LA COUPOLE WITH MICHÈLE WHO ALWAYS MADE HIM DRINK TOO MUCH AND HE WENT BACK TO LIBÉRATION WITH HER FOR AN INTERVIEW. THERE WERE TRAFFIC JAMS: THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN A TAXI GOING AND THE SAME COMING BACK. I HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIM THAT EVENING AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT HAD BEEN EXTREMELY WEARING. AT ABOUT EIGHT HE WENT TO ARLETTE’S TO WATCH A FILM ON TELEVISION AND AFTERWARD SHE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE ARRIVED HE SEEMED OUT OF SORTS. SHE TELEPHONED ME THE NEXT DAY AT ABOUT NOON. “SARTRE IS NOT WELL.” THE EVENING BEFORE TOWARD TEN O’CLOCK HE HAD HAD A STROKE. HIS FACE HAD TWISTED HIS CIGARETTE HAD FALLEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND SITTING THERE IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION HE ASKED “WHERE’S THE TELLY?” HE LOOKED LIKE A DOTARD OF NINETY. THREE TIMES HIS ARM HAD BEEN PARALYZED. ZAIDMANN ALERTED GAVE ORDERS FOR INJECTIONS OF PERVINCAMINE TO BEGIN AT ONCE. SARTRE HAD ALREADY HAD THE FIRST. THE USE OF HIS ARM HAD COME BACK AND HIS FACE WAS NO LONGER DISTORTED BUT HIS BRAIN WAS NOT TOO GOOD. I TELEPHONED DR. LEBEAU AT THE SALPÊTRIÈRE AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD SEE SARTRE IN TWO DAYS TIME.

THAT EVENING BOST CAME TO SEE US. SARTRE ARRIVED BEFORE HIM. I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT HIS STROKE; HE REMEMBERED ALMOST NOTHING. WITH BOST WE DISCUSSED THE ELECTIONS. SARTRE MADE A POINT OF DRINKING TWO GLASSES OF SCOTCH AND TOWARD ELEVEN HE FELL TO PIECES. I PACKED HIM OFF TO BED. BOST LEFT AT ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND I LAY DOWN ON MY DIVAN FULLY DRESSED.

AT ABOUT NINE IN THE MORNING SARTRE APPEARED ON THE BALCONY ABOVE MY LIVING ROOM. “HOW ARE YOU?” I ASKED. HE TOUCHED HIS MOUTH. “BETTER” HE SAID. “MY TOOTHACHE HAS GONE.” “BUT YOU DIDN’T HAVE A TOOTHACHE …” “I CERTAINLY DID AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL. ALL THROUGH THE EVENING WITH ARON.” HE VANISHED INTO THE BATHROOM. WHEN HE CAME DOWN TO DRINK HIS FRUIT JUICE I SAID “IT WASN’T ARON WHO WAS HERE LAST NIGHT. IT WAS BOST.” “OH YES. THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT.” “YOU REMEMBER. THE EVENING BEGAN VERY PLEASANTLY. AND THEN WHEN YOU HAD DRUNK A SCOTCH YOU FELT UNWELL.” “IT WASN’T BECAUSE OF THE SCOTCH IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE MY EAR PLUGS OUT.”

I WAS PANIC-STRICKEN. LILIANE CAME TO FETCH HIM FOR COFFEE AND TOWARD TEN SHE TELEPHONED ME. THINGS WERE GOING BADLY. SARTRE HAD SAID TO HER “I SPENT AN EXCELLENT EVENING WITH GEORGES MICHEL.P I’M GLAD TO BE RECONCILED WITH HIM. IT WAS STUPID BEING ON BAD TERMS. THEY WERE VERY KIND AND LET ME GO TO BED AT ELEVEN.” (SARTRE WAS NOT ON BAD TERMS AT ALL WITH GEORGES MICHEL.) HE HAD GONE ON WANDERING IN HIS SPEECH.

I TELEPHONED DR. LEBEAU ASKING HIM TO SEE SARTRE THAT DAY. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS NOT REALLY HIS PROVINCE AND HE WOULD ARRANGE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME WITH A NEUROLOGIST DR. B. THE APPOINTMENT WAS FIXED FOR SIX IN THE EVENING.

AT HALF PAST FIVE SYLVIE AND I WENT TO FETCH SARTRE AT ARLETTE’S. HE SEEMED NORMAL AND I TOOK HIM IN A TAXI TO SEE DR. B. TO WHOM I EXPLAINED THE FACTS. HE EXAMINED SARTRE AND GAVE HIM A PRESCRIPTION AND THE ADDRESS OF A WOMAN DOCTOR TO WHOM HE WAS TO GO DIRECTLY FOR AN ENCEPHALOGRAM. SYLVIE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR US IN A CAFÉ AND SHE CAME TOO. WE LEFT SARTRE IN THE HALL OF A LARGE MODERN BUILDING AND WENT TO SIT IN A GHASTLY CAFÉ LIT UP IN RED WHERE A BIRD PERPETUALLY WHISTLED AND CALLED OUT “BONJOUR NAPOLÉON!” AFTER AN HOUR WE WENT UP TO THE DOCTOR’S AND WAITED IN A QUIET COMFORTABLE RECEPTION ROOM. SARTRE JOINED US AT ABOUT EIGHT. THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANY SERIOUS ANOMALY. WE TOOK A TAXI BACK TO MY APARTMENT DROPPING SYLVIE ON THE WAY. SARTRE SAID THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN VERY KIND; SHE HAD TAKEN HIM ONTO THE BALCONY TO SHOW HIM THE VIEW AND HAD OFFERED HIM A GLASS OF WHISKEY. THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE. DR. B. HAD PRESCRIBED MEDICINES HAD URGED SARTRE TO DRINK VERY LITTLE AND HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO SMOKE. BUT SARTRE HAD DECIDED TO TAKE NO NOTICE. WE SPENT THE EVENING PLAYING DRAUGHTS AND WENT TO BED EARLY.

THE NEXT DAY SARTRE SEEMED WELL. BUT AT ELEVEN LILIANE TOLD ME ON THE TELEPHONE THAT WHILE HE WAS HAVING BREAKFAST WITH HER HE HAD GROWN STRANGE. HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER—SOMETIMES HE TOOK HER FOR ARLETTE SOMETIMES FOR ME. SHE SAID SHE WAS LILIANE SIEGEL. “I KNOW LILIANE SIEGEL” HE REPLIED. “SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR AND SHE TEACHES YOGA.” THAT WAS TRUE; BUT HE WOULD NOT IDENTIFY LILIANE WITH THIS TEACHER OF YOGA. HE ALSO ASKED “WHO WAS THAT GIRL WHO CAME YESTERDAY WITH THE CASTOR AND ME?” “NO DOUBT IT WAS SYLVIE.” “NO. NOT SYLVIE. IT WAS YOU.”

I HAD LUNCH WITH HIM. HE TOLD ME AGAIN ABOUT THE GLASS OF WHISKEY THAT THE DOCTOR HAD OFFERED HIM. I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY A FALSE MEMORY. HE ADMITTED IT. I SPENT THE AFTERNOON AT HIS PLACE. HE READ. SO DID I.

THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT AT HALF PAST EIGHT WITH DR. B. AT THE SALPÊTRIÈRE. WHEN I REACHED HIS DOOR AT EIGHT I FOUND ARLETTE WHO WAS TO COME WITH US RINGING WITHOUT GETTING ANY REPLY. I OPENED THE DOOR WITH MY KEY. SARTRE WAS FAST ASLEEP. HE DRESSED QUICKLY AND A TAXI RUSHED US TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE A MALE NURSE TOOK CHARGE OF HIM. WHILE ARLETTE AND I WERE TRYING TO FIND A TAXI SHE SUGGESTED THAT SARTRE SHOULD SPEND A FEW DAYS WITH HER AT JUNAS TO RECOVER. I PROPOSED THAT AFTERWARD HE SHOULD JOIN ME IN AVIGNON. BUT WOULD HE AGREE? SHE POINTED OUT THAT HIS NO OFTEN MEANT YES AND THAT WHEN HIS HAND WAS FORCED HE WAS NOT DISPLEASED. AT NOON I SAW DR. B. AT THE SALPÊTRIÈRE. HE TOLD ME THAT SARTRE HAD HAD AN ATTACK OF ANOXIA THAT IS ASPHYXIA OF THE BRAIN CAUSED PARTLY BY TOBACCO BUT ABOVE ALL BY THE STATE OF HIS ARTERIES AND ARTERIOLES. HE APPROVED OF THE PLAN OF A STAY IN THE COUNTRY AND SARTRE AGREED TO IT WITHOUT DEBATE. B. ASKED HIM TO WRITE HIS NAME AND ADDRESS AND SARTRE DID SO WITH EASE WHEREUPON B. SAID CONFIDENTLY “WE SHALL CURE YOU.”

I SAW SARTRE AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON AND HE SPENT THE EVENING AT WANDA’S WHERE LILIANE SIEGEL’S SON PICKED HIM UP TO DRIVE HIM TO MY APARTMENT. LATER SHE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN WANDERING TELLING HER AT LENGTH ABOUT A NEGRESS WHO SAT ON HIS KNEE …

ON THE NEXT DAY SATURDAY OUR EVENING WITH SYLVIE WAS NOT A SUCCESS. SARTRE OBSTINATELY DRANK AND SMOKED AND WE WERE HORRIFIED. WE REPROACHED HIM AT LUNCH THE NEXT DAY WHICH PUT HIM OUT OF COUNTENANCE. ONCE AGAIN HIS ELEVATOR WAS NOT WORKING BUT HE INSISTED ON CLIMBING THE TEN FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO GO BACK AND WORK IN HIS ROOM. BY WORKING AT THAT JUNCTURE HE MEANT PREPARING AN ARTICLE HE HAD BEEN ASKED FOR ON THE GREEK RESISTANCE: HE READ AND REREAD AN EXCELLENT BOOK LES KAPETANIOS BUT I DO NOT THINK HE RETAINED ANYTHING. IN THE EVENING WE PLAYED DRAUGHTS AT MY FLAT. HE WAS MARKEDLY BETTER BUT HIS MEMORY WAS STILL CLOUDED.

ON MONDAY EVENING HAVING SPENT THE WHOLE DAY READING LES KAPETANIOS AGAIN HE LEFT FOR JUNAS. ARLETTE CALLED ME ON TUESDAY. THE WEATHER WAS FINE; SARTRE WAS GLAD TO BE IN THE SOUTH AGAIN; HE WAS READING DETECTIVE STORIES. BUT HIS MIND WAS STILL TROUBLED. HE HAD ASKED “JUST WHY AM I HERE? AH IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS UNWELL. AND THEN WE ARE EXPECTING HERCULE POIROT.” SHE THOUGHT THE DETECTIVE STORIES INCITED HIM TO FABULATE AND SHE TOOK HIM OUT FOR WALKS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. ON FRIDAY SHE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS IN AN EXCELLENT MOOD AND THAT HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF BY CLIMBING THE ROCKS IN THE QUARRIES THAT WERE TO BE FOUND IN THE GARRIGUE THE WILD COUNTRYSIDE. BUT WHEN PUIG HIS SECRETARY CAME TO SPEND TWO DAYS WITH THEM SARTRE CAUTIOUSLY ASKED ARLETTE AFTER HE HAD LEFT “DID DEDIJER COME?” (DEDIJER HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO PUIG BUT HE TOO WAS A CLOSE FRIEND OF ARLETTE’S.) ON SATURDAY SHE CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS WELL BUT THERE WAS ONE ODD THING—ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO ASK FOR HIS USUAL WHISKEY BEFORE GOING TO BED. LATER I HEARD THAT HE HAD ALSO FORGOTTEN IT ON SATURDAY. WHEN I REMINDED SARTRE ABOUT THE WHISKEY HE SAID IN A VEXED TONE “IT’S BECAUSE I’M SENILE.”

IN THE TRAIN THAT WAS CARRYING ME TO AVIGNON ON SUNDAY MORNING I FELT EXTREMELY ANXIOUS. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT KIND OF SARTRE I SHOULD FIND. WHEN I SAW THE TREES IN BLOSSOM AND AFTER VALENCE THE CYPRESSES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WORLD WAS LURCHING SWINGING OVER INTO DEATH AND FOREVER.

SARTRE GOT OUT OF A TAXI IN FRONT OF THE HÔTEL DE L’EUROPE WHERE I WAS WAITING FOR HIM. HE WAS UNSHAVEN HIS HAIR WAS TOO LONG AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN MUCH OLDER. I TOOK HIM TO HIS ROOM AND I GAVE HIM SOME BOOKS (A LIFE OF RAYMOND ROUSSEL AND JOYCE’S LETTERS). WE TALKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN I LEFT HIM TO REST.

WE WENT OUT AT DUSK AND WALKED TOWARD THE NEARBY PLACE DE L’HORLOGE. “WE MUST TURN TO THE LEFT” HE TOLD ME AND HE WAS RIGHT. AND SHOWING ME A HOTEL HE ADDED “I WAITED FOR YOU IN FRONT OF THAT HOTEL THIS MORNING WHILE YOU WENT INTO A SHOP.” I REPLIED THAT WE HAD NOT YET BEEN FOR A WALK IN AVIGNON. “THEN IT WAS ARLETTE.” BUT ARLETTE HAD NOT GOT OUT OF THE TAXI. SARTRE COULD NOT MANAGE TO PIN THIS FALSE RECOLLECTION BUT HE CLUNG TO IT. WE HAD AN EXCELLENT DINNER WITH WHICH WE DRANK CHÂTEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE. IN HIS ROOM I GAVE HIM A GLASS OF SCOTCH WITH PLENTY OF ICE AND WE PLAYED DRAUGHTS BUT HE FOUND IT HARD TO FOCUS HIS ATTENTION.

HE WAS IN FINE FORM THE NEXT MORNING WHEN WE HAD BREAKFAST IN HIS ROOM. A TAXI TOOK US TO VILLENEUVE-LÈS-AVIGNON. SOME YEARS BEFORE I HAD SPENT THREE WEEKS AT THE HOTEL WHERE WE HAD LUNCH AND THE YOUNG PROPRIETRESS RECOGNIZED ME. SHE TOLD SARTRE THAT HER SON WHO WAS SEVEN WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS LEARNING SOME OF HIS POEMS AT SCHOOL. THIS SURPRISED US. WHEN WE GOT UP TO GO SHE HANDED SARTRE THE VISITORS’ BOOK. “YOUR SIGNATURE PLEASE MONSIEUR PRÉVERT.” “BUT I AM NOT MONSIEUR PRÉVERT” SAID SARTRE LEAVING HER OPEN-MOUTHED. WE VISITED THE FORT SAINT ANDRÉ ONCE MORE. THERE WAS A GREAT WIND BLOWING AND IT TOUSLED SARTRE’S HAIR. HOW VULNERABLE HE LOOKED TO ME! WE SAT ON THE GRASS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN ON A BENCH BY THE GATE OF THE FORT WITH AVIGNON AND THE RHÔNE LAID OUT BEFORE US: IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPRING—MASSES OF TREES IN BLOSSOM. THE WEATHER WAS MILD AND GENTLE; IT WAS QUITE LIKE HAPPINESS.

FROM THE SQUARE IN VILLENEUVE A TAXI TOOK US BACK TO THE HOTEL. THE CONCIERGE WENT WITH US TO THE NUNS WHO WERE TO GIVE SARTRE AN INJECTION EVERY DAY. IT WAS ONLY TWENTY YARDS FROM THE HOTEL AND I LEFT HIM THERE. HE CAME BACK BY HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY. AFTER DINNER IN THE PLACE DE L’HORLOGE WE PLAYED DRAUGHTS AND SARTRE WAS IN FULL POSSESSION OF HIS WITS.

THE NEXT MORNING WE HIRED A CHAUFFEUR-DRIVEN CAR TO GO AND REVISIT LES BAUX. THE FIRST VIEW WAS QUITE SUPERB—A DESERT OF ROCKS UNDER A PERFECT SKY. SARTRE SMILED WITH PLEASURE AND IN A HAPPY VOICE HE SAID “WHEN WE TRAVEL THE TWO OF US THIS SUMMER …” I TOOK HIM UP “YOU MEAN WHEN WE ARE IN ROME?” “YES” HE SAID. BUT SEVERAL TIMES HE REPEATED “WHEN WE TRAVEL THE TWO OF US …” WE HAD A DRINK IN THE SUN AT L’OUSTAU DE BAUMANIÈRE WHERE WE LUNCHED. WE WALKED ABOUT THE DEAD TOWN. WE CAME BACK BY WAY OF SAINT-RÉMY THROUGH A LOVELY COUNTRYSIDE ALL GAY WITH FLOWERS. SARTRE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH. SMILING I ASKED “HAVE YOU AN APPOINTMENT?” “YES OF COURSE WITH THAT WOMAN WE MET THIS MORNING IN A CAFÉ.” I SAID WE HAD NOT BEEN IN A CAFÉ. “OH YES WE WERE—BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS WE LEFT AVIGNON.” HE HESITATED. “OR PERHAPS IT WAS YESTERDAY.” I PERSUADED HIM THAT WE HAD NO APPOINTMENT AT ALL. LATER HE TOLD ME THAT IT HAD BEEN A FLOATING IMPRESSION NO MORE AND THAT EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN LEFT TO HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT BACK TO THE HOTEL. AFTER THAT WE STAYED IN HIS ROOM READING SIDE BY SIDE. HE READ VERY SLOWLY. IT TOOK HIM TWO DAYS TO GET THROUGH LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. YET HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. IN THE EVENING HE SAID TO ME “BUT YOU REALLY MUST GET BACK TO WORK YOU KNOW.” “SO I SHALL” I SAID “ONCE YOU ARE QUITE WELL AGAIN.”

THE NEXT DAY MARCH 21 THE WEATHER WAS STILL DAZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL. “IT’S SPRING!” SAID SARTRE GAILY. WE WENT BY CAR TO SEE THE PONT DU GARD AGAIN. AS WE WERE DRINKING A GLASS OF WHISKEY ON THE SUNLIT TERRACE OF THE AUBERGE DU VIEUX MOULIN HE ASKED ME “IS THAT A NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRIDGE?” WITH PAIN IN MY HEART I SET HIM STRAIGHT. AFTER THE MEAL WE WALKED A LITTLE WAY ALONG THE PATHS THAT RUN BEHIND THE BRIDGE. SARTRE SAT DOWN ON EVERY BENCH. IT WAS THE FOOD THAT MADE HIM FEEL HEAVY HE SAID. AND WHEN HE KEPT LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK TO AVIGNON I SAID “WE HAVE NO APPOINTMENT YOU KNOW.” “OH YES WE HAVE” HE REPLIED “WITH THAT GIRL …” BUT HE DID NOT DWELL UPON IT. THE DAY BEFORE WHEN HE WAS GOING FOR HIS INJECTION HE HAD MET A PAIR OF SECONDARY-SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO BELONGED TO A LIBÉRATION COMMITTEE; AS HE CAME BACK THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS WAITING FOR HIM AT THE CORNER AND HE HAD TALKED TO HER. THE IDEA OF A RENDEZVOUS WAS LINKED TO THAT INCIDENT. IN THE EVENING I MADE SARTRE RECAPITULATE HIS DAY AND HE REMEMBERED IT VERY WELL. WE PLAYED DRAUGHTS AND TALKED.

THE NEXT MORNING HE WOKE AT TEN JUST AS OUR BREAKFAST WAS ARRIVING. “WE HAD A PLEASANT EVENING YESTERDAY” I SAID. HE HESITATED. “YES. BUT YESTERDAY EVENING I THOUGHT I WAS INVISIBLE.” “YOU DIDN’T TELL ME ABOUT IT.” “IT’S SINCE I CAME HERE. I FELT I WAS IN DANGER WITH REGARD TO OTHER PEOPLE. SO I THOUGHT I WAS INVISIBLE.” WHEN I PRESSED HIM HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE IN PARTICULAR BUT THAT HE HAD THE FEELING OF BEING AN OBJECT WITHOUT ANY RELATION TO OTHERS. “BUT YOU HAVE RELATIONS WITH THEM.” “IF I CAUSE THEM TO EXIST.” HE ALSO ASSERTED THAT IT WAS ALWAYS I WHO ORDERED THE MEALS APART FROM THE WINE WHICH WAS UNTRUE. FROM ALL THIS I CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM. HE MADE LIGHT OF THE GAPS IN HIS MEMORY AND HIS SLIGHT WANDERING YET HE DID SAY THAT HE WAS “OUT OF SORTS” IF NOT ILL. TWICE DURING THIS STAY HE REPEATED WITH A LOOK OF EXTREME DEJECTION “I AM GOING TO BE SIXTY-EIGHT!” ONCE IN PARIS SHORTLY BEFORE HIS STROKE HE HAD SAID TO ME “IN THE END THEY’LL CUT MY LEGS OFF.” AND WHEN I PROTESTED HE WENT ON “OH AS FOR MY LEGS—I COULD DO WITHOUT THEM.” OBVIOUSLY HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A GENERALIZED ANXIETY RELATED TO HIS BODY TO HIS AGE AND TO DEATH.

THAT DAY WE WENT TO ARLES. AFTER LUNCH AT THE JULES CÉSAR WE LOOKED AT SAINT TROPHIME’S THE THEATER AND THE AMPHITHEATER ONCE AGAIN. SARTRE SEEMED VERY-LOW SPIRITED. IN THE AMPHITHEATER HE ASKED ME “HAS THAT THING THAT WAS LOST BEEN FOUND?” “WHAT THING?” “THE THING WE NEEDED TO SEE THE AMPHITHEATER. THIS MORNING IT WAS LOST.” HE BECAME CONFUSED AND REPEATED IT SEVERAL TIMES. AT SAINT TROPHIME’S WE HAD TAKEN A TICKET VALID FOR THE CHURCH ONLY THEN AT THE THEATER A TICKET THAT COVERED EVERYTHING: WAS IT THAT HE WAS DREAMING ABOUT? IN ANY EVENT HE WAS QUITE BEWILDERED. WE WENT BACK BY WAY OF TARASCON WHERE WE VISITED THE CASTLE AGAIN. WHEN WE REACHED AVIGNON SARTRE SAID TO THE CHAUFFEUR “SO IT’S AGREED THAT YOU WILL BE PAID TOMORROW.” “OH NO” I SAID “TOMORROW WE ARE LEAVING. WE SHALL NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN.” SARTRE PAID GIVING AN ENORMOUS TIP. THE NUN WHO GAVE HIM HIS INJECTIONS HAD SAID HE COULD PAY FOR THEM ALL TOGETHER ON THE LAST DAY. NO DOUBT HE HAD CONFUSED THE TWO IN HIS MIND.

THE NEXT MORNING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS STAY BUT THAT GOING BACK TO PARIS SEEMED TO HIM “NORMAL.” HE HAD NOT LEFT AN ADDRESS WITH MICHÈLE VIAN AND I ASKED HIM WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT BE OFFENDED. “OH NO” HE SAID. “SHE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE YOUR ADDRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THAT MAN WHO ANNOYED YOU.” “ME?” “YES. BECAUSE HE WANTED NOTES ABOUT MY ILLNESS.” I DENIED IT AND SARTRE SAID WITH A LOOK OF SURPRISE “I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.” THESE IMAGINARY RECOLLECTIONS WHICH WENT BACK TO THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS STROKE DID NOT WORRY ME UNDULY.

THAT MORNING SOME JOURNALISTS TELEPHONED BUT SARTRE WOULD NOT SEE THEM. WE HAD A DRINK IN THE SUN ON THE PLACE DE L’HORLOGE AND LUNCHED ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A RESTAURANT. SARTRE AMUSED HIMSELF BY WATCHING THE PEOPLE WHO WENT BY IN THE STREET. WE WENT FOR A LONG WALK AROUND THE TOWN AND IT DID NOT SEEM TO TIRE HIM AT ALL. AT SIX WE TOOK OUR PLACES ON THE TRAIN AND DINED ABOARD. LILIANE SIEGEL AND HER SON WERE WAITING FOR US AT THE STATION AT HALF PAST ELEVEN AND THEY DROVE US TO MY APARTMENT.

THE NEXT DAY SARTRE HAD HIS HAIR CUT WHICH MADE HIM LOOK MUCH YOUNGER. HE HAD LUNCH WITH ARLETTE AND TOLD ME SHE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH HIM BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME WHY. SHE LET ME KNOW BY TELEPHONE. SARTRE HAD TOLD HER THAT HIS CIGARETTES HAD BURNED IN THE GUTTER AND WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A DOUBTING EXPRESSION HE ADDED “YOU THINK I’M SENILE BUT IT’S TRUE FOR ALL THAT.” HE ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE GIVEN AN ENGLISHMAN AN INTERVIEW.

IN THE AFTERNOON I BROUGHT HIM HIS SUITCASE. HE WENT THROUGH HIS MAIL AND LOOKED AT THE BOOKS THAT HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM. AT MY PLACE IN THE EVENING WITH SYLVIE HE COULD NOT KEEP UP A CONVERSATION AND WENT TO BED AT ABOUT HALF PAST ELEVEN.

WHEN HE WOKE HE REMEMBERED THE DAY BEFORE PERFECTLY. HE WAS HAPPY AT THE IDEA OF SEEING A YOUNG GREEK WOMAN TOWARD NOON; SHE HAD WRITTEN AN ESSAY ON HIM AND HE WAS FOND OF HER. HE SEEMED PERFECTLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING BUT I WONDERED WHEN HE WOULD BE CAPABLE OF GOING BACK TO WORK.

THAT EVENING HE DID NOT NOTICE THAT SYLVIE HAD PUT WATER IN THE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. I VERY MUCH DISLIKED THIS LITTLE BETRAYAL BUT I COULD THINK OF NO OTHER WAY OF DIMINISHING HIS RATION OF SPIRITS. IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING HE REPEATED “I’M GOING TO BE SIXTY-EIGHT!” I ASKED HIM WHY THAT SHOULD STRIKE HIM SO. “BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS ONLY GOING TO BE SIXTY-SEVEN.”

THE NEXT DAY WE SAW DR. B. AGAIN. I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT SARTRE’S STATES OF CONFUSION. SARTRE WAS THERE AND HE LISTENED UNMOVED. THEN B. TOOK HIM INTO THE LABORATORY TO EXAMINE HIM. HE DID NOT THINK HIS CONDITION BAD. SARTRE’S HANDWRITING WAS CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN THE TIME BEFORE. B. TOLD HIM THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMIES WERE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO BUT OF THE TWO HE WOULD RATHER FORBID HIM THE ALCOHOL WHICH MIGHT RUIN HIS BRAIN. ALL HE ALLOWED HIM WAS ONE GLASS OF WINE AT THE END OF LUNCH. HE PRESCRIBED CERTAIN MEDICINES. WHEN WE WENT OUT SARTRE WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED AT THE IDEA OF HAVING TO GIVE UP SPIRITS. “IT’S SIXTY YEARS OF MY LIFE THAT I’M SAYING GOODBYE TO.” A LITTLE LATER WHEN HE WAS NOT THERE I TELEPHONED DR. B. HE TOLD ME THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER STROKE HE WAS NOT SURE THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT SARTRE BACK ON HIS FEET AGAIN. “HE IS IN DANGER?” I ASKED. “YES.” HE SAID. I HAD KNOWN IT; BUT EVEN SO IT WAS A STUNNING BLOW. MORE OR LESS CLEARLY SARTRE KNEW THAT HE WAS THREATENED BECAUSE THAT EVENING HE SAID “ONE HAS TO END BY COMING TO AN END. AFTER ALL I HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD. I HAVE DONE WHAT I HAD TO DO.”

WHEN HE WOKE IN THE MORNING HE ONCE AGAIN RAMBLED A LITTLE. HE TOLD ME ABOUT A PREFACE THAT HE WAS TO WRITE FOR SOME GREEKS WHICH WAS TRUE BUT ALSO OF ANOTHER FOR A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD WANTED TO KILL HIMSELF BECAUSE HIS RELATIVES KEPT HIM PRISONER. SARTRE COULD NO LONGER REMEMBER HIS NAME BUT IT WAS A FRIEND OF HORST AND LANZMANN. IN FACT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY QUESTION OF THIS YOUNG MAN AT ANY TIME. YET IN THE EVENING SARTRE SEEMED TO BE PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT; HE SEEMED QUITE RESIGNED TO GIVING UP ALCOHOL AND HE BEAT ME AT DRAUGHTS.

A SHORT RESPITE. TWO DAYS LATER ARLETTE RANG ME UP IN THE MORNING TO SAY THAT SARTRE WAS GIDDY: HE HAD FALLEN. DR. B. CONSULTED BY TELEPHONE HAD ADVISED REDUCING THE DOSES OF HIS MEDICINES; BUT IF IN SPITE OF THAT THE DISTURBANCE CONTINUED SARTRE WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO THE SALPÊTRIÈRE FOR OBSERVATION. WHEN HE WAS WITH ME IN THE AFTERNOON HE STAGGERED AS HE WALKED.

HIS BALANCE WAS BETTER THE NEXT DAY. BUT WHEN HE WAS DRINKING MORNING COFFEE WITH LILIANE HE WANDERED AGAIN TALKING ABOUT AN APPOINTMENT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WITH SOME WORKMEN. NEVERTHELESS THAT DAY WE SPENT A DELIGHTFUL EVENING WITH SYLVIE. CHEERFULLY HE SAID TO US “WHEN I’M SEVENTY I SHALL DRINK WHISKEY AGAIN.” THAT COMFORTED ME BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO MEAN THAT HE WOULD KEEP OFF IT FOR TWO YEARS.

DURING THIS EARLY PART OF APRIL HE WAS FAIRLY WELL IN SPITE OF A CERTAIN WEAKNESS IN HIS LEGS AND A FEW CLOUDY PASSAGES IN HIS MIND. HE READ A LITTLE CRITICAL BOOK ON THE WALL WHICH INTERESTED HIM. HE BEGAN TO REGRET NOT WORKING. HE WROTE A LETTER PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS CALLING FOR AN AMNESTY FOR THOSE AMERICANS WHO HAD DESERTED DURING THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

HE SPENT A FEW DAYS AT JUNAS WITH ARLETTE. SYLVIE AND I WENT BY CAR TO GET THEM AND TAKE THEM TO SAINT-PAUL-DE-VENCE. WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE SARTRE CAME DOWN FROM THE BALCONY WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE SUN. AS IT HAPPENED EVERY TIME WHEN I SAW HIM AFTER AN ABSENCE I DID NOT THINK HE LOOKED WELL—HIS FACE WAS SWOLLEN AND THERE WAS SOMETHING NUMB AND AWKWARD ABOUT HIS MOVEMENTS. WE SET OFF ALL FOUR OF US ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE OF THE LANGUEDOC—GARRIGUES AND VINEYARDS FRUIT TREES IN BLOSSOM BLUE HILLS IN THE DISTANCE. WE DROVE OVER THE CRAU SKIRTED THE CAMARGUE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ARLES AND STOPPED FOR LUNCH AT AN AGREEABLE HOTEL AT THE ENTRANCE TO AIX. SYLVIE STAYED IN THE CAR TO SLEEP. WE SET OFF AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF BRIGNOLES GOING THROUGH THAT AIX LANDSCAPE I LOVE SO MUCH. AT ONE POINT SARTRE SAID “BUT WHAT’S HAPPENED TO THAT YOUNG MAN WE HAD WITH US? HAS HE BEEN FORGOTTEN?” HE DID NOT DWELL ON IT. AFTERWARD HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS SYLVIE’S ABSENCE DURING LUNCH THAT HAD MUDDLED HIM.

HE GAVE NO FURTHER SIGNS OF MENTAL CONFUSION DURING OUR STAY AT SAINT-PAUL BUT HE HAD NO ENERGY. THE SUN SHONE SPLENDIDLY; THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS BRILLIANT. HE LIKED DRIVING ABOUT SEEING NICE CAGNES CANNES MOUGINS. BUT IN HIS ROOM HE DRAGGED ENDLESSLY ALONG WITH LES KAPETANIOS AND HE COULD SCARCELY MANAGE TO READ EVEN DETECTIVE STORIES. “HE CAN’T GO ON LIKE THIS” ARLETTE SAID TO ME AND HER VOICE WAS FRIGHTENED. HE HIMSELF WAS AWARE OF HIS STATE. ONE MORNING AS HE LIT HIS FIRST CIGARETTE HE SAID TO ME “I CAN’T WORK ANY MORE … I’M GAGA AS THEY SAY.…” YET HE RETAINED HIS PLEASURE IN LIFE. WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT PICASSO WHO DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY-ONE I OBSERVED “THAT’S A FINE AGE. IT WOULD GIVE YOU ANOTHER TWENTY-FOUR YEARS.” “TWENTY-FOUR YEARS IS NOT MUCH” HE REPLIED.

HE WENT BACK TO PARIS WITH ARLETTE; I WITH SYLVIE. WHEN I LUNCHED WITH HIM THE DAY OF MY RETURN HE WAS LIVELY AND AFFECTIONATE; MY ACCOUNT OF THE JOURNEY FROM SAINT-PAUL TO PARIS AMUSED HIM. AT HIS PLACE IN THE AFTERNOON HE TOOK PLEASURE IN OPENING HIS LETTERS AND LEAFING THROUGH THE BOOKS THAT HAD BEEN SENT. BUT ON OTHER DAYS HE SEEMED TO ME SHRUNK IN UPON HIMSELF LACKLUSTER DROWSY. THIS ALTERNATE HOPE AND INTENSE ANXIETY WORE ME OUT.

WE SAW DR. B. AGAIN. WHILE HE WAS TESTING SARTRE’S REFLEXES IN ANOTHER ROOM I HEARD HIM SAY “GOOD … VERY GOOD …” EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT EXCEPT THE BLOOD PRESSURE: 200/120. WHEN THEY CAME BACK INTO THE CONSULTING ROOM SARTRE COMPLAINED OF HIS NUMBNESS OF MIND. WITH A KIND OF CHARMING SIMPLICITY HE SAID “I’M NOT STUPID. BUT I’M EMPTY.” B. PRESCRIBED A TONIC AND REDUCED THE WHOLE RANGE OF MEDICINES. THEN SINCE SARTRE COULD NO LONGER WRITE SERIOUS BOOKS HE ADVISED HIM TO TRY POETRY. WHEN WE LEFT SARTRE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO RECOVER HIS AGGRESSIVITY CRIED “HE’S DONE NOTHING FOR ME THAT GODDAMN FOOL!” WHEN I PROTESTED HE REPLIED “ZAIDMANN WOULD HAVE DONE QUITE AS WELL.” IN FACT HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE GOT BETTER BY HIMSELF WHICH WAS UTTERLY UNTRUE.

HE WENT ON HAVING UPS AND DOWNS. HE SLEPT A LITTLE IN THE AFTERNOONS AND ON WAKING HE OFTEN UTTERED JUMBLED WORDS. ONE DAY WHEN ARLETTE WAS TELLING HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO SEE THE PRIVATE SCREENING OF LANZMANN’S FILM POURQUOI ISRAËL? HE SAID “YOU WEREN’T THE ONLY ONE. ARLETTE WAS THERE TOO.” “ARLETTE?” “YES IT INTERESTS HER BECAUSE SHE’S A PIED-NOIR JEWESS.”Q THEN SHE ASKED HIM “AND WHAT ABOUT ME? WHO AM I?” SARTRE RECOVERED HIMSELF. “OH I MEANT YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER GIRL WITH YOU.” SHE TOLD SARTRE THAT THERE WAS A BOMB SCARE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW AND THAT THE PLACE HAD BEEN SEARCHED. HE ONLY TOLD ME THAT THE SHOWING HAD STARTED LATE. HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHY. THINGS SLIPPED OFF HIM AND AS ALL HIS FRIENDS NOTICED HE WAS FAR AWAY RATHER SLEEPY ALMOST GLUM WITH A FIXED SMILE OF UNIVERSAL KINDNESS ON HIS LIPS (A SMILE CAUSED BY A SLIGHT PARALYSIS OF THE FACIAL MUSCLES).

YET I OFTEN SPENT PLEASANT EVENINGS WITH HIM. HE DRANK HIS FRUIT JUICE WITH PLEASURE AND THE SUNDAY MEALS WITH SYLVIE WERE ALWAYS LIVELY. TITO GERASSI WHO WANTED TO WRITE A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF SARTRE LUNCHED WITH HIM AND ME AT LA COUPOLE AND THEN TALKED TO HIM ALONE. HE THOUGHT SARTRE WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. ON MAY 21 SARTRE RESUMED HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH PIERRE VICTOR AND GAVI AND THEY SAID TO LILIANE SIEGEL “HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY INTELLIGENT: EXACTLY AS HE WAS BEFORE.” AT THE END OF MAY HE TOOK PART IN A LES TEMPS MODERNES MEETING. HORST AND LANZMANN (WHO HAD HAD THE MOST DEPLORABLE IMPRESSION WHEN SARTRE CAME BACK FROM THE SOUTH) THOUGHT HIM AS LIVELY AND AS INTELLIGENT AS HE HAD EVER BEEN. HE STILL HESITATED OVER PROPER NAMES AND HE HAD A VERY POOR RECOLLECTION OF THE VARIOUS STAGES OF HIS ILLNESS PARTICULARLY THE FITS OF DIZZINESS. SOMETIMES HE REFERRED TO HIS “MINIPLEGIA” AND ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME “IT CAN’T HAVE BEEN MUCH FUN FOR YOU.” “NO” I REPLIED “BUT EVEN LESS FOR YOU.” “OH ME. I DIDN’T REALIZE WHAT WAS GOING ON.”

SARTRE WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE GONE BACK TO HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR AND GAVI. DURING OUR EVENINGS WITH SYLVIE HE WAS CHEERFUL AND EVEN FUNNY. ON JUNE 17 HE TALKED TO FRANCIS JEANSON ABOUT HIS ADOLESCENCE. HE DEFINED HIS RELATION TO VIOLENCE.

THE ONLY DARK CLOUD WAS HIS EYES. AS HE DID EVERY YEAR HE HAD BEEN TO SEE AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST WHO FOUND THAT HE HAD LOST FOUR-TENTHS OF HIS VISION—ALMOST HALF. AND HE HAD ONLY ONE EYE THAT WORKED. HE WAS TO FOLLOW A CERTAIN TREATMENT FOR TWO WEEKS AND IF THAT GAVE NO RESULT THEN A MINOR OPERATION WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.

TWO WEEKS LATER THE OCULIST COULD NOT BE SURE OF THE NATURE OF THE TROUBLE. THE FACT WAS THAT SARTRE SAW BADLY. I REMEMBER HIM LEANING OVER A BIG MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT OUR JAPANESE FRIEND HAD GIVEN HIM AND ANXIOUSLY PEERING AT NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. EVEN WITH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO READ EVERYTHING. HE TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN ALWAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS.

A FEW DAYS LATER ARLETTE TELEPHONED ME—SARTRE’S DIZZINESS HAD RETURNED AND HE HAD FALLEN AS HE WAS GETTING OUT OF BED. THAT SAME AFTERNOON HE SAW A WELL-KNOWN SPECIALIST. IN THE EVENING WHEN HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS CONSULTATION HE WAS DEJECTED; THE OCULIST HAD DISCOVERED A THROMBOSIS IN A TEMPORAL VEIN AND A TRIPLE HEMORRHAGE AT THE BACK OF THE EYE. ON THE OTHER HAND DR. B. WITH WHOM I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT WAS ENCOURAGING. THE DIZZINESS HAD STOPPED AND SARTRE COULD WALK PROPERLY AGAIN. THE BLOOD PRESSURE WAS STILL HIGH—200/120—BUT FROM THE NEUROLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL. B. GAVE ME A LETTER FOR THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST IN WHICH HE STATED THAT SARTRE WAS SUFFERING FROM A “CEREBRAL ARTERIOPATHY WITH SPELLS OF GIDDINESS” THAT HE HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND THAT HE WAS PREDIABETIC. AT A CERTAIN LEVEL I HAD KNOWN ALL THIS BUT SEEING IT WRITTEN DOWN OVERWHELMED ME. AT THE SIGHT OF MY DISTRESS LANZMANN TELEPHONED A FRIEND OF HIS A PHYSICIAN NAMED COURNOT. DR. COURNOT EXPLAINED THAT SARTRE WOULD NEED AT LEAST A YEAR FOR A COMPLETE RECOVERY BUT ONCE HE HAD RECOVERED HE MIGHT LIVE TILL NINETY. IF ANOTHER STROKE WERE TO OCCUR THERE WAS NO TELLING WHETHER IT WOULD BE MILD OR VERY SERIOUS INDEED.

WHEN SARTRE SAW THE OCULIST AGAIN THE DOCTOR SAID THAT TWO HEMORRHAGES OUT OF THE THREE HAD BEEN CURED AND TWO-TENTHS OF THE VISION REGAINED. TWO OR THREE MORE WEEKS WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE WHOLE. SARTRE WAS STILL UNEASY. AT A LUNCHEON WITH SOME FRIENDS HE WAS FOND OF—ROBERT GALLIMARD AND JEANNINE MICHEL’S WIDOW—HE DID NOT UTTER A WORD. ON LEAVING THEM HE ASKED ME NOT WITHOUT ANXIETY “IT DIDN’T LOOK ODD DID IT?” BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING HE BORE HIS MISFORTUNE PATIENTLY. IN HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR AND GAVI HE DID NOT SPEAK MUCH BUT HE FOLLOWED THE ARGUMENTS ATTENTIVELY AND HIS INTERVENTIONS WERE ALL VERY MUCH TO THE POINT. HE TOOK PART IN A DISCUSSION WITH THE YOUNG WORKERS OF VILLENEUVE-LA-GARENNE (HE HAD BEEN THERE FOR AN INVESTIGATION) THAT APPEARED IN LIBÉRATION HALFWAY THROUGH JUNE. HE SIGNED AN APPEAL FOR THE BANNING OF AN ORDRE NOUVEAU MEETING; AND WHEN ON JUNE 21 THE MEETING TOOK PLACE HE ATTACKED MARCELLIN’S DECISION IN LIBÉRATION. AT THE LES TEMPS MODERNES GATHERING OF JUNE 27 HE WAS THOROUGHLY CHEERFUL AND SO HE REMAINED DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED. DR. B. WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS HEALTH AND IT SEEMED TO SARTRE THAT HIS SIGHT WAS IMPROVING.

AS USUAL HE SPENT THREE WEEKS WITH ARLETTE. I WAS TRAVELING IN THE SOUTH WITH SYLVIE AND ARLETTE GAVE ME NEWS OF HIM. IT WAS GOOD NEWS THOUGH WALKING SOON TIRED HIM AND HE FOUND READING HARD. ON JUNE 29 WE WENT TO JUNAS TO FETCH HIM AND TAKE HIM TO VENICE WHERE HE WAS TO MEET WANDA. ONCE MORE SEEING SARTRE AGAIN WAS A JOY MIXED WITH SADNESS. BECAUSE OF HIS TWISTED MOUTH AND HIS BAD SIGHT HIS FACE HAD A SET EXPRESSION; HE SEEMED OLD AND DEVOID OF RESILIENCE.

YET THE FOUR DAYS WE SPENT TRAVELING FROM JUNAS TO VENICE WERE PLEASANT. SARTRE WAS RATHER BEWILDERED RATHER VACANT BUT LIVELY. IN SPITE OF NOT SEEING WELL HE COULD MAKE OUT THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THE MOTION KEPT HIM INTERESTED. WE WENT THROUGH NÎMES AND FOLLOWED THE DURANCE AVOIDING ARLES AND AIX BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC JAMS. WE LUNCHED AND LUNCHED VERY WELL AT THE CHÂTEAU DE MEYRARGUES AND SARTRE DRANK A GLASS OF OLD CHÂTEAUNEUF. I HAD BOOKED ROOMS AT THE BASTIDE DU TOURTOUR AND WE GOT THERE BY CHARMING LITTLE SIDE ROADS. THE VIEW FROM OUR BALCONIES WAS SENSATIONAL: PINE WOODS AND MOUNTAINS BLUE IN THE DISTANCE.

THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I REJOINED SARTRE ON HIS TERRACE GIVING ONTO THE WONDERFUL PROVENÇAL LANDSCAPE I FOUND THAT HE HAD ALREADY BEEN SITTING THERE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR. HAD HE NOT BEEN BORED? NO. HE LIKED GAZING AT THE WORLD DOING NOTHING. AT JUNAS HE WOULD SIT ON THE BALCONY FOR LONG PERIODS AND CONTEMPLATE THE VILLAGE. I WAS GLAD THAT HE DID NOT FIND IDLENESS WEARISOME BUT IT RATHER WOUNDED MY HEART THAT TO FIND PLEASURE IN IT HE SHOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY “EMPTY” AS HE HAD SAID TO THE DOCTOR.

BOST HAD ADVISED US TO GO TO MENTON AND EAT A FISH SOUP WITH AIÖLI AT FRANCINE’S. SARTRE WAS VERY EAGER TO DO SO. WE HAD A TABLE ON THE TERRACE OF THE LITTLE RESTAURANT; THEY BROUGHT US THE SOUP AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE OVERTURNED HIS PLATE ONTO HIS FEET. THERE WAS NO GREAT DAMAGE. WE MOPPED HIS SHOES AND THE WAITRESS BROUGHT ANOTHER PLATEFUL. SARTRE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CLUMSY BUT NOW WITH HIS BAD SIGHT HE SEEMED QUITE DISORIENTED. HE OBSERVED THE ACCIDENT WITH AN ABNORMAL INDIFFERENCE AS THOUGH HE NO LONGER FELT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS OR CONCERNED BY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

WE REACHED GENOA BY A HIGHWAY CROWDED WITH LORRIES AND THE WAY INTO THE TOWN WAS LONG AND DIFFICULT BUT FAR FROM GROWING IMPATIENT SARTRE WAS IN A CHARMING MOOD. WE TOOK ROOMS IN A HOTEL NEAR THE STATION AND HAD A LIGHT DINNER AT A RESTAURANT IN THE SQUARE.

ONCE AGAIN AT ABOUT NINE IN THE MORNING I FOUND SARTRE AT HIS WINDOW; HE HAD RISEN AT HALF PAST SEVEN AND SINCE THEN HE HAD BEEN AMUSING HIMSELF BY WATCHING THE STATION SQUARE AND ITS ACTIVITIES. HE HAD THE FEELING OF BEING IN ITALY AND IT DELIGHTED HIM. WE LUNCHED AT VERONA EATING A DELICIOUS HAM BAKED IN PASTRY AND WE CHECKED IN AT A HOTEL WITH VERY PRETTY RATHER BAROQUE ROOMS WHERE I HAD BEEN WITH SARTRE TEN YEARS BEFORE. WHILE HE HAD A REST I WENT FOR A WALK WITH SYLVIE. LATER WE ALL THREE HAD A DRINK IN ONE OF THE MANY CAFÉS ON THE MAIN SQUARE BESIDE THE AMPHITHEATER. SYLVIE WAS TIRED AND I DINED ALONE WITH SARTRE IN A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE TO THE HOTEL. HE WALKED TAKING LITTLE STEPS BUT WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY AND HE LOOKED VERY HAPPY.

IN VENICE SYLVIE LEFT THE CAR AT THE ENORMOUS GARAGE IN THE PIAZZALE ROMA AND WE STEPPED INTO A GONDOLA. HAVING LEFT SARTRE AT HIS HOTEL ON THE GRAND CANAL WE WENT ON TO THE CAVALETTO BEHIND SAINT MARK’S SQUARE AND SETTLED IN. THEN WE WENT TO FIND SARTRE. WE GAVE HIM THE TRANSISTOR SO THAT HE COULD LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE MORNING WHILE WANDA WAS STILL ASLEEP IN THE NEXT ROOM. HE TOOK US TO THE FENICE FOR LUNCH SCARCELY MISTAKING THE WAY AT ALL. AS A PROTECTION FROM THE SUN WHICH WAS DANGEROUS FOR HIM HE WORE A STRAW HAT THAT HE LOATHED. “I’M ASHAMED OF BEING SEEN IN THIS HAT” HE TOLD ME LATER IN ROME. WE DRANK COCKTAILS IN SAINT MARK’S SQUARE AND THEN WENT BACK TO SARTRE’S HOTEL; FROM THERE A MOTORBOAT TOOK HIM TO THE AIRPORT TO FETCH WANDA. STANDING IN THE BOAT HE WAVED TO US SMILING WITH THAT KINDLY ALMOST TOO KINDLY SMILE THAT RARELY LEFT HIS LIPS. FOR NO CLEARLY DEFINED REASON I WAS AFRAID FOR HIM; HE SEEMED TO ME SO VERY VULNERABLE!

TWO DAYS LATER ON AUGUST 3 I MET HIM AT NINE O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING AT A CAFÉ IN SAINT MARK’S SQUARE. WE MET IN THE SAME WAY FOR THE THREE FOLLOWING DAYS. SOMETIMES HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME. TWICE BEING UNABLE TO SEE THE TIME ON HIS WATCH HE HAD GOT UP AT FOUR AND DRESSED. ONLY THEN DID HE REALIZE THAT IT WAS STILL DARK AND GO BACK TO BED. WANDA GAVE HIM HIS MEDICINES WITH METICULOUS CARE. HE WALKED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL WITH HER SOMETIMES FOR NEARLY AN HOUR. HE LOVED BEING IN VENICE.

THEN ONE MORNING I LEFT HIM. I DID NOT WANT SYLVIE TO GET BORED WITH VENICE WHICH SHE WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW BY HEART. AND EVEN THOUGH THESE MORNING ENCOUNTERS PLEASED SARTRE (“I SHALL MISS YOU” HE SAID) THEY DID PUT HIM OUT A LITTLE. I LEFT ADDRESSES WITH WANDA AND I SET OFF FOR FLORENCE.

I REACHED ROME ON AUGUST 15 AND ON THE NEXT AFTERNOON I WENT WITH SYLVIE TO MEET SARTRE AT FIUMICINO. PEERING THROUGH THE GLASS WE RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BY HIS HAT HIS HEIGHT AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY THE WAY HE WALKED. IN ONE HAND HE WAS CARRYING A LITTLE TRAVELING BAG AND IN THE OTHER THE TRANSISTOR. HE TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING OUR TERRACE AT THE HOTEL AGAIN. HE WAS WELL BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A LITTLE ILL-ADAPTED. SYLVIE PUT THE TRANSISTOR DOWN ON A TABLE. “DON’T YOU WANT TO KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF?” HE ASKED. “WHY NO. IT’S FOR YOU.” “OH I DON’T NEED IT.” YET AFTERWARD HE SPENT HOURS LISTENING TO MUSIC AND HE ADMITTED THAT BEING DEPRIVED OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DISAGREEABLE.

DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING AT ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT SARTRE WOULD ALREADY BE THERE ON THE TERRACE OFTEN HAVING HIS BREAKFAST AND GAZING VAGUELY AT THE SCENE BELOW. HIS SIGHT WAS MUCH WORSE THAN IT HAD BEEN AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE. I GOT MICHÈLE TO TELEPHONE HIS OCULIST WHO SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT THERE HAD BEEN A FRESH HEMORRHAGE. HE ADVISED THAT A LOCAL SPECIALIST SHOULD BE CONSULTED. THE HOTEL TOLD ME OF ONE WHO WAS SAID TO BE THE BEST IN ROME; HE HAD CURED CARLO LEVI OF A DETACHED RETINA. WE ARRANGED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE NEXT AFTERNOON. THE DOCTOR LIVED IN THE PRATI DISTRICT AN OPEN CHEERFUL QUARTER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TIBER. HE WAS YOUNG AND LIKEABLE. HE ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WAS A HEMORRHAGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EYE. NOTHING COULD BE DONE APART FROM WAITING. THERE WAS ALSO THE BEGINNING OF GLAUCOMA AND THE PRESSURE WITHIN THE EYE WAS TOO GREAT. HE PRESCRIBED DROPS OF PILOCARPINE AND DIAMOX. THE NEXT TIME WE WENT TO SEE HIM THE PRESSURE HAD DIMINISHED BUT THEN I HAD GIVEN SARTRE HIS DIAMOX DROPS THAT VERY MORNING. WHEN HE WENT BACK AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THEM THE PRESSURE WAS HIGHER BUT IT WAS NOT EXCESSIVE. THE OCULIST HOPED THAT THE PILOCARPINE ALONE WOULD NEUTRALIZE THE GLAUCOMA. AT THE LAST CONSULTATION HE WOULD NOT LET SARTRE PAY A FEE. HE ASKED ONLY FOR A SIGNED BOOK. SARTRE TOOK HIM THREE IN WHICH HE HAD BLINDLY WRITTEN A FEW WORDS. THIS FRIENDLY ENCOURAGING DOCTOR PLEASED HIM VERY MUCH.

WE LIKED THE REGULARITY OF OUR DAYS. IN THE MORNING I READ ALOUD TO SARTRE (THAT YEAR I READ HIM WORKS ON FLAUBERT AN ISSUE OF LES TEMPS MODERNES DEVOTED TO CHILE HORST’SR AND LE ROY LADURIE’S LATEST BOOKS AS WELL AS TWO FAT AND UNUSUALLY INTERESTING VOLUMES ON JAPAN AND MATHIEZ’S LA VIE CHÈRE SOUS LA TERREUR). THEN AFTER A QUICK LUNCH HE WOULD SLEEP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. I WENT FOR A WALK WITH SYLVIE OR WE READ SIDE BY SIDE IN THE COVERED PART OF THE TERRACE. IT WAS HOT THERE IN SPITE OF THE AIR CONDITIONING BUT I LIKED THAT WARMTH THE DIMNESS AND THE SMELL OF IMITATION LEATHER. WHEN SARTRE WOKE I READ HIM THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN PAPERS. IN THE EVENING WE DINED WITH SYLVIE.

IT WAS AT MEALS THAT SARTRE WORRIED ME MOST. HE WAS NO LONGER INCONTINENT AND HE ONLY DRANK THE ALLOWED QUANTITIES OF ALCOHOL COFFEE AND TEA. BUT IT GRIEVED ME TO SEE HIM GULP DOWN SUCH QUANTITIES OF PASTA AND ABOVE ALL OF ICES WHEN HE WAS PREDIABETIC. AND THEN BECAUSE OF HIS FALSE TEETH THE NEAR-INSENSIBILITY OF HIS LIPS AND HIS HALF-BLINDNESS HE DID NOT EAT IN A CLEAN FASHION; THERE WAS FOOD ALL ROUND HIS MOUTH AND I WAS AFRAID OF VEXING HIM IF I TOLD HIM TO WIPE IT. HE STRUGGLED WITH THE SPAGHETTI TAKING UP HUGE FORKFULS AND LETTING THEM FALL. HE COULD HARDLY BE BROUGHT TO LET ME CUT UP HIS MEAT.

INTELLECTUALLY HE WAS OFTEN VERY LIVELY AND HIS MEMORY WAS KEEN. BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD DRIFT AWAY. SOMETIMES IT IRRITATED ME; AT OTHERS IT ALMOST BROUGHT TEARS OF COMPASSION TO MY EYES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HE SAID TO ME “I’M ASHAMED OF MYSELF IN THIS HAT” OR WHEN HE WHISPERED TO ME AS WE LEFT A RESTAURANT “PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT ME” IN A VOICE THAT IMPLIED “THEY THINK I’M IN A VERY BAD WAY.” BUT I WAS ALSO ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHED BY HIS GOOD HUMOR HIS PATIENCE AND HIS CARE NOT TO SEEM DREARY. HE NEVER COMPLAINED OF NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO SEE PROPERLY.

THE MAGAZINE AUT AUT DEVOTED AN ISSUE TO SARTRE PUBLISHING THE TEXT OF THE STATEMENT HE HAD MADE ON “SUBJECTIVITY AND MARXISM” AT THE GRAMSCI INSTITUTE IN 1961 AS WELL AS ARTICLES ABOUT HIM. I READ IT ALOUD TRANSLATING AS I WENT. OCCASIONALLY WE MET LELIO BASSO OR ROSSANA ROSSANDA. SYLVIE LEFT US ON SEPTEMBER 5 TAKING THE CAR BACK TO PARIS AND THE DAY AFTER THAT ALICE SCHWARZER A GERMAN NEWSPAPERWOMAN WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I HAD MADE AT M.L.F. MEETINGS AND FOR WHOM I HAD A LIKING SHARED BY SARTRE CAME TO SEE US. SHE MADE A SHORT FILM OF ME FOR GERMAN TELEVISION AND SHE FILMED BOTH OF US ON OUR TERRACE IN THE EVENING. WE HAD AN AGREEABLE DINNER WITH HER. OUR FRIENDS THE BOSTS ALSO CAME TO SEE US AND SPENT A FEW DAYS IN ROME.

AS WE WERE LEAVING I FELT ANXIOUS. “SHALL WE EVER COME BACK?” I WONDERED CASTING A LAST GLANCE OVER THE CITY. “SO THIS ROMAN VACATION AND ITS SAD SWEETNESS IS OVER” I WROTE WHEN I WAS BACK IN PARIS. THE FALL WAS SPLENDID BUT I WAS AFRAID OF THE FATIGUES OF PARIS FOR SARTRE.

HE CHANGED HIS LIVING QUARTERS HIS PLACE ON THE BOULEVARD RASPAIL HAVING BECOME TOO SMALL. ARLETTE AND LILIANE HAD FOUND HIM A MUCH BIGGER APARTMENT; IT TOO WAS ON THE TENTH FLOOR BUT THERE WERE TWO ELEVATORS. THE APARTMENT HAD A BIG STUDY OVERLOOKING THE RUE DU DÉPART WITH THE NEW TOUR MONTPARNASSE HIGHRISE IN THE FOREGROUND AND THE EIFFEL TOWER IN THE DISTANCE. SARTRE WOULD HAVE ONE OF THE TWO BEDROOMS WHOSE WINDOWS OPENED ONTO AN INNER GARDEN WHILE SOMEONE ELSE COULD SLEEP IN THE OTHER SO THAT HE WOULD NO LONGER BE ALONE AT NIGHT. HE VISITED THIS NEW AND AS YET UNFURNISHED DWELLING AND LIKED IT.

HE WAS IN AN EXCELLENT: FRAME OF MIND AND HE SAID HE COULD SEE A LITTLE BETTER. THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF READING BUT HE COULD PLAY DRAUGHTS. HE SPOKE OF WHAT HE CALLED “MY ILLNESS” WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION. “I’M TOO FAT” HE TOLD ME. “IT’S BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS.” AND IN THE STREET WHEN WE WERE GOING TO HAVE LUNCH “DON’T WALK SO QUICKLY; I CAN’T KEEP UP WITH YOU BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS.” I SAID “BUT YOU AREN’T ILL ANYMORE.” “WHAT AM I THEN?” HE SAID. “FAILING?” THE WORD WRUNG MY HEART. “OF COURSE NOT” I SAID. “IT’S ONLY THAT YOUR LEGS ARE A LITTLE WEAK.” BUT I WAS NOT REALLY SURE WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HIS CONDITION.

HOWEVER A FEW DAYS LATER HE DID FEEL TIRED. “I’VE BEEN SEEING TOO MANY PEOPLE. IN ROME WE SAW NOBODY.” HOW WOULD HE BEAR THE STRESS OF THE TRIAL THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON OCTOBER 8? THIS WAS AN OLD STORY. IN MAY 1971 MINUTE HAD CALLED FOR SARTRE TO BE PUT IN PRISON. IN JUNE THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR CHARGED HIM WITH LIBEL ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLES SELECTED FROM LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE AND TOUT. AS HE WAS LEFT AT LIBERTY HE SPENT HIS VACATION IN ITALY. THE PRELIMINARY JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN OCTOBER AND WAS SOON FINISHED. IN FEBRUARY 1972 THE TIME OF THE TRIAL WAS STILL NOT KNOWN BUT NOW THE DATE WAS FIXED.

ON OCTOBER 8 SARTRE WOULD APPEAR BEFORE A PARIS COURT SUED BY EIGHT MEMBERS OF MINUTE‘S EDITORIAL STAFF WHO CLAIMED 800000 FRANCS BY WAY OF DAMAGES FOR LIBEL INSULTS AND THREATS OF DEATH. IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE HAD NOT HANDLED THEM GENTLY. IT HAD CALLED THEM “A GANG OF UNDESIRABLES ILL-PURGED AT THE LIBERATION HALF-PAY MEMBERS OF THE O.A.S.S AND PROFESSIONAL INCITERS TO MURDER.” THOSE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE HAD THROWN THE WRITS INTO THE WASTEPAPER BASKET AND SARTRE WAS THEREFORE ESTOPPED PRECLUDED FROM MAKING ANY DENIAL. IN ORDER TO COUNTERATTACK HE WAS OBLIGED TO CALL WITNESSES WHO WOULD STATE THAT IN ALL GOOD FAITH HE HAD THE RIGHT TO THINK WHAT HIS PAPER HAD PRINTED. AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER WE BEGAN TO WORK ON THE MINUTE PAPERS THAT SARTRE’S COUNSEL GISÈLE HALIMI HAD SENT US AND WE DRAFTED THE MAIN LINES OF THE STATEMENT HE WOULD MAKE TO THE COURT.

BUT HE WAS NOT WELL. ONCE AGAIN HIS ELEVATOR WAS OUT OF ORDER; HE WALKED ALL THE WAY UP TO HIS APARTMENT; HE HAD PAINS IN THE BACK OF HIS NECK. HE SAW DR. B. WHO COULD NOT SAY THAT HE WAS EITHER WELL OR ILL AND WHO WANTED A GENERAL CHECKUP. WHEN SARTRE WOKE THE NEXT DAY HE SEEMED A LITTLE BEWILDERED SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED TO HIM FOR A LONG WHILE. I SAID TO HIM “TODAY YOU’RE GOING TO SEE THE OCULIST.” “NO IT’S NOT THE OCULIST.” “YES IT IS.” “NO. I’M GOING TO SEE THE DOCTOR WHO TAKES CARE OF ME AFTER DR. B.” “THAT IS THE OCULIST.” “OH REALLY?” HE ASKED WHETHER IT WAS DR. B. WHO HAD PRESCRIBED THE PILOCARPINE. HE WAS EXTREMELY UNWILLING TO HAVE A CONSULTATION ABOUT HIS EYES OR EVEN TO THINK ABOUT THEM. ARLETTE AND LILIANE WENT TO THE OCULIST’S WITH HIM AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE TOLD ME HE WOULD NEVER GET HIS SIGHT BACK ENTIRELY AND FOR A LONG WHILE HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO READ. HE LOOKED UPON THE PROSPECT WITH A KIND OF DEJECTED APATHY. I LEARNED FROM ZAIDMANN THAT HE HAD A THROMBOSIS WHICH INEVITABLY PRODUCED HEMORRHAGES.

HE STAYED WITH ME MUCH OF THE TIME DURING HIS MOVE FROM ONE APARTMENT TO THE OTHER WHICH WAS TAKEN IN HAND BY ARLETTE AND LILIANE. ON SEPTEMBER 26 HE SIGNED THE UNION OF WRITERS’ APPEAL AGAINST REPRESSION IN CHILE AND ANOTHER AGAINST THE LACK OF OFFICIAL NEWS CONCERNING THAT COUNTRY. WE PERFECTED HIS STATEMENT ABOUT MINUTE AND HE TRIED TO LEARN IT BY HEART BUT HE COULD NOT MANAGE TO MEMORIZE MORE THAN THE BEGINNING AND I WONDERED HOW HE WAS GOING TO MANAGE. OUR EVENINGS WERE PLEASANT BUT HE WENT HEAVILY TO SLEEP IN THE AFTERNOONS.

ON OCTOBER 8 GISÈLE HALIMI AND ONE OF HER YOUNG COLLEAGUES ARRIVED IN A CAR TO TAKE US TO THE PLACE DAUPHINE FOR LUNCH. THEY WERE RATHER NERVOUS THEY SAID; SARTRE NOT AT ALL. HE WAS REMOTE AS HE OFTEN WAS THESE DAYS. WE WENT TO COURT 17 AND FOR AN HOUR WE LISTENED TO QUICKLY DECIDED MINOR OFFENSES. AT TWO O’CLOCK SARTRE’S CASE WAS CALLED. NONE OF MINUTE‘S PEOPLE WAS THERE. THEY HAD BRIEFED BIAGGI AS WELL AS THEIR USUAL COUNSEL. FIRST THERE WERE ARGUMENTS ABOUT PROCEDURE THEN THE WITNESSES WERE TOLD TO LEAVE AND SARTRE ADDRESSED THE COURT. HE DEALT WITH MINUTE ON THE LINES WE HAD AGREED UPON AND HE DID SO QUITE POWERFULLY. BUT HE MADE THE MISTAKE OF REFERRING TO THE ABDUCTION OF NOGRETTE AND ON THIS POINT HE GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE. THEN THE WITNESSES WERE HEARD. IN HIS ALTERCATION WITH BIAGGI DANIEL MAYER WAS VERY FUNNY. BIAGGI HAD PRESUMED TO SAY HE WAS ATTACKING SARTRE BECAUSE OF HIS PLAY THE FLIES. DEBÛ-BRIDEL REPLIED THAT A GOOD MANY RESISTERS INCLUDING PAULHAN WERE OF THE OPINION THAT ONE MIGHT EXPRESS ONESELF PUBLICLY DURING THE OCCUPATION SO LONG AS WHAT WAS EXPRESSED WAS EFFICACIOUS WHICH WAS THE CASE WITH THE FLIES. CLAUDE MAURIAC LET HIMSELF BE BULLIED AND BECAME RATHER FLUSTERED; HE WAS THERE OUT OF FRIENDSHIP FOR SARTRE BUT HE HAD NOT LIKED COMING AT ALL. THEN THERE WERE STILL MORE ARGUMENTS ABOUT PROCEDURE. MINUTE HAD ABANDONED THE CHARGES OF INSULTS AND LIBEL RETAINING ONLY THAT OF THREATS. THEIR YOUNG COUNSEL INFLICTED A VEHEMENT EMPTY SPEECH ON US. THE PRESIDING JUDGE SHARPLY TOLD HIM TO STOP PERPETUALLY BANGING ON THE TABLE BECAUSE IT INTERFERED WITH THE MICROPHONES. THEN BIAGGI POURED OUT A FLOOD OF INSULTS; HE OBVIOUSLY HAD NOT STUDIED HIS BRIEF OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND A GOOD MANY UNWISE PASSAGES IN LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE INSTEAD OF LIMITING HIMSELF TO ABUSE AND LITERARY QUOTATIONS. GISÈLE HALIMI SPOKE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR. SHE DREW UP A PITILESS INDICTMENT OF MINUTE—ITS REFERENCES TO THE O.A.S. ITS INCITEMENTS TO MURDER ITS RACISM. FROM TIME TO TIME THE JUDGE REMINDED HER THAT THE QUESTION LAY ELSEWHERE BUT HE LET HER GO ON. BEFORE BRINGING THE SITTING TO A CLOSE HE LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN ORDER NOT TO CONDEMN MINUTE YET AGAIN THE SUIT WOULD BE ANNULLED SINCE THE WRIT THAT COUPLED INSULTS AND LIBEL WAS NOT ADMISSIBLE.T WE LEFT VERY HAPPY TO BE DONE WITH IT.

THAT EVENING GISÈLE HALIMI TELEPHONED TO TELL ME THAT SHE HAD BEEN ACCOSTED BY FRANCE-SOIR JOURNALISTS WHO ASKED WITH MAN-EATING EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACES “WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH SARTRE? HE DOESN’T LOOK WELL.” “HE’S CONVALESCING” SHE REPLIED. AND THEY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SHAME “IF ANYTHING HAPPENS YOU’LL LET US KNOW WON’T YOU?” THE FACT IS THAT WITH HIS DRAGGING WALK HIS CORPULENCE AND HIS REMOTE VAGUE LOOK SARTRE WAS A SAD SPECTACLE. WE HAD PASSED SIMONE SIGNORET IN THE PLACE DAUPHINE AND SHE HAD SEEMED MUCH STRUCK BY THE SIGHT OF HIM. HE HAD SOME SUSPICION OF IT. ONE DAY AS WE WERE WALKING SLOWLY ALONG THE RUE DELAMBRE ON THE WAY TO HAVE LUNCH AT THE DÔME HE SAID “I DON’T LOOK TOO MUCH LIKE AN INVALID DO I?” I LIED REASSURINGLY.

LATE ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE DAY OF THE TRIAL HE WENT TO THE OCULIST’S WITH ARLETTE. THE OCULIST TOLD HIM FLATLY THAT THE RETINA WAS AFFECTED—PARTLY AFFECTED TOWARD THE CENTER—AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO HOPE OF A CURE. AN OPTICIAN WOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH A SPECIAL APPARATUS THAT MIGHT ALLOW HIM TO READ PERHAPS AN HOUR A DAY USING LATERAL VISION. SARTRE STILL LOOKED SHATTERED THE NEXT MORNING. I SAID “THE TRIAL HAS WORN YOU OUT.” “NO NOT THE TRIAL. IT WAS GOING TO SEE THE DOCTOR.” IN ITSELF THE CONSULTATION HAD NOT BEEN TIRING BUT THE OCULIST HAD GIVEN HIM A CRUSHING BLOW. THAT EVENING WHEN BOST CAME AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE TRIAL SARTRE NEVER SAID A WORD AND HE WENT TO BED AS MIDNIGHT STRUCK.

ON OCTOBER 12 HE UNDERWENT A COMPLETE EXAMINATION AT THE SALPÊTRIÈRE; ARLETTE TOOK HIM THERE AND I WENT TO FETCH HIM AT NOON. DR. B. TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRUE. HE HAD ABOUT THREE HOURS OF REAL HEALTH A DAY; THEN HE SLEPT OR HIS MIND WAS FAR AWAY. WHEN THE EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER HE SEEMED QUITE OVERWHELMED.

ON TUESDAY OCTOBER 16 I WENT TO THE OPTICIAN’S WITH HIM. THE OPTICIAN LEFT HIM SCARCELY ANY HOPE EITHER. PERHAPS SARTRE MIGHT BE ABLE TO READ FOR AN HOUR A DAY THOUGH IN UNCOMFORTABLE CONDITIONS BY MEANS OF THE SPECIAL APPARATUS THAT WE WERE TO ORDER FROM HIM. THAT EVENING FOR THE FIRST TIME WE SPOKE ABOUT HIS NEAR-BLINDNESS AND HE SEEMED TO MEAN IT WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE DID NOT SUFFER ALL THAT MUCH. (YET APART FROM CERTAIN TOOTHACHES HE HAD NEVER ADMITTED THAT HE WAS SUFFERING NOT EVEN WHEN RENAL CALCULI WERE MAKING HIM WRITHE WITH PAIN.) I SAW THE RESULTS OF THE SALPÊTRIÈRE EXAMINATIONS THE NEXT DAY. THEY WERE NOT GOOD. SARTRE HAD DIABETES AND HIS ENCEPHALOGRAM HAD CHANGED FOR THE WORSE. LATER DR. B. TOLD ME OVER THE TELEPHONE THAT THIS CHANGE HAD NO DOUBT BEEN CAUSED BY THE DIABETES. SO PERHAPS IT WAS REVERSIBLE I THOUGHT HOPEFULLY. SLOW WAVES HAD BEEN DETECTED IN HIS BRAIN AND THESE MIGHT EXPLAIN HIS STATES OF DROWSINESS. (BUT EVEN NOW I AM STILL CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE A DEFENSE AGAINST HIS ANXIETY OVER HIS EYES.)

THE OPTICIAN HAD LENT US THE APPARATUS HE HAD TOLD US ABOUT BUT IT WAS USELESS TO SARTRE. THE WORDS WENT BY SO SLOWLY THAT HE PREFERRED HEARING THEM READ ALOUD—SO SLOWLY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO REVISE AND CORRECT HIS OWN TEXTS. HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER HAD ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT. WE SENT THE APPARATUS BACK.

SARTRE RETURNED TO HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR AND GAVI. HE LISTENED TO THEM HE CRITICIZED A LITTLE BUT HE SCARCELY INTERVENED AT ALL. ONE SUNDAY MORNING THE TEMPS MODERNES TEAM CAME TO HIS APARTMENT TO TALK ABOUT A LEAD ARTICLE ON A QUESTION THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM AND THAT WE OFTEN DISCUSSED THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARABS. HE DID NOT SAY A WORD AND THE NEXT DAY HE TOLD ARLETTE THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE SLEPT. LANZMANN AND POUILLON WERE APPALLED. HE OFTEN DROPPED OFF WHILE I WAS READING ALOUD EVEN WHEN IT WAS LIBÉRATION WHICH INTERESTED HIM. HE DID NOT REALIZE HIS CONDITION. HE TOLD ONE OF HIS OLD FRIENDS CLAUDE DAY “MY EYES ARE NO GOOD BUT AS FAR AS MY BRAIN IS CONCERNED EVERYTHING’S FINE.”

DURING OUR EVENINGS WITH SYLVIE HE WAS CHEERFUL AND SOMETIMES HE EVEN LAUGHED WHICH WAS NOW VERY UNUSUAL FOR HIM. BUT WHEN WE HAD LUNCH ONE DAY WITH HER AND OUR FRIEND LENA WHO HAD JUST COME FROM MOSCOW AND WHOM HE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO SEEING AGAIN HE WAS SILENT AND LIFELESS. LENA WAS LOW-SPIRITED; I WAS TIRED. ONLY SYLVIE PROVIDED A LITTLE ANIMATION AND THAT NOT WITHOUT EFFORT. FORTUNATELY WE HAD A MORE RELAXED EVENING WITH LENA SOME TIME AFTER THIS.

AT THE END OF OCTOBER SARTRE BEGAN TO RALLY. HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN OUR CONVERSATIONS. ONE MORNING WHEN A NEW TENANT WAS MOVING INTO THE APARTMENT OVER MINE THERE WAS SUCH A NOISE THAT ON LEAVING ME HE SAID “THIS IS CERTAINLY THE VERY FIRST TIME I’VE EVER BEEN GLAD TO GO AWAY FROM YOUR PLACE!”

OUR MAIN SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION WAS THE YOM KIPPUR WAR AND THIS TIME WE BOTH HAD EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE. HE EXPLAINED HIS IN ONE OF HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR AND GAVI. “I AM NOT FOR ISRAEL IN HER PRESENT FORM. BUT I DON’T ACCEPT THE IDEA OF HER DESTRUCTION.… WE MUST FIGHT SO THAT THESE THREE MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOT DONE AWAY WITH OR REDUCED TO SLAVERY.… YOU CAN’T BE PRO-ARAB WITHOUT ALSO BEING SOMEWHAT PRO-JEW AS VICTOR IS BY THE WAY AND YOU CAN’T BE PRO-JEW WITHOUT BEING PRO-ARAB AS I AM. SO THIS LEADS ONE TO A CURIOUS KIND OF ATTITUDE.…”

ON OCTOBER 26 HE GAVE ELI BEN GAL AN INTERVIEW OVER THE TELEPHONE.U AT THE END OF THE YOM KIPPUR WAR HE MADE A STATEMENT IN WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID “MY HOPE IS THAT THE ISRAELIS WILL REALIZE THAT IT IS THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM THAT PROVIDES THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE ARABS’ WARLIKE SPIRIT.” HE DICTATED TO ME A DECLARATION FOR LIBÉRATION WHICH THE PAPER PRINTED ON OCTOBER 29 ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT AGREE WITH HIS WORDS AT ALL. “THIS WAR CANNOT BUT CHECK THE MIDDLE EAST’S EVOLUTION IN THE DIRECTION OF SOCIALISM” HE SAID. AND HE ANALYZED THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE TWO SIDES. ON NOVEMBER 7 SARTRE CALVEL AND DEBÛ-BRIDEL CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD OFFICIALLY CHARGED SOME UNKNOWN PERSONV WITH LISTENING TO THE AGENCE DE PRESSE LIBÉRATION’S TELEPHONE AND OPENING ITS LETTERS. (THE CHARGE OF COURSE LED TO NOTHING.)

SINCE HE WAS NOW FEELING BETTER SARTRE BEGAN TO FIND HIS ILLNESS MORE WEARISOME. HE DISLIKED HAVING INJECTIONS MORNING AND EVENING. “ARE THEY GOING TO CARRY ON WITH THIS TREATMENT ALL MY LIFE?” HE ASKED ME IN AN IRRITATED VOICE. I WENT WITH HIM TO A SPECIALIST IN DIABETES WHOSE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT HE HAD A SLIGHT DEGREE OF GLYCEMIA; HE PRESCRIBED SOME PILLS AND A SUGARLESS DIET AND HE FORBADE HIM THE FRUIT JUICE THAT HE DRANK IN THE EVENING. DR. B. THOUGHT HE WAS IMPROVING AND CUT OUT SOME OF HIS MEDICINES. ON LEAVING SARTRE SAID WITH A DISSATISFIED LOOK “HE’S NOT INTERESTED IN ME!” AND IT WAS TRUE THAT ALTHOUGH B. PAID GREAT ATTENTION TO SARTRE’S ILLNESS HE DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN HIM AS A WRITER SINCE HE HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD TURN TO POETRY.

THE FOLLOWING DAYS WITH ARLETTE WITH ME SYLVIE AND LENA HE WAS IMMEDIATELY PRESENT AND FULL OF LIFE. HE NO LONGER WENT TO ANY ENTERTAINMENT AT ALL BUT ONE EVENING WITH MICHÈLE VIAN WE DID GO TO THE LITTLE THEATER IN THE RUE MOUFFETARD TO SEE A VERY GOOD PLAY BASED ON THE THÉVENIN CASE J’AI CONFIANCE EN LA JUSTICE DE MON PAYS.W SARTRE APPLAUDED IT HEARTILY. THE NEXT DAY AT THE LES TEMPS MODERNES MEETING WHICH TOOK PLACE IN HIS APARTMENT HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE READING OF POUILLON’S LEAD ARTICLE ON THE ISRAELI-ARAB CONFLICT. HE DISCUSSED IT AND MADE COMMENTS. AND THAT EVENING TOO WHEN BOST WAS THERE HE WAS FULL OF LIFE.

BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH JULY THE EDITOR OF LIBÉRATION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE RAPE OF A VIETNAMESE STUDENT BY ONE OF HER COMPANIONS A BLACK IMMIGRANT AND IT TIRED HIM VERY MUCH. WHEN I CAME TO SEE HIM AT FIVE I MADE HIM GO AND REST. HE SLEPT THE NEXT AFTERNOON AS WELL WHILE I WAS READING HIM THE TWO VERSIONS OF A CHAPTER IN MADAME BOVARY AT HIS REQUEST. IN THE EVENING WHEN SYLVIE WAS WITH US HE WAS WIDE AWAKE AND HE DELIGHTED IN THE FINE FUR-LINED COAT WE HAD GIVEN HER. SHE PREPARED COLD SPICED TEA TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT JUICE AND HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THE NEXT MORNING HE TOOK PLEASURE IN SEEING HIS YOUNG FRIEND THE GREEK GIRL AGAIN; SHE HAD COME TO LIVE IN PARIS FOR A WHILE TO FOLLOW THE LECTURES ON PHILOSOPHY AT THE SORBONNE. BUT IN THE AFTERNOON HE SLEPT HEAVILY ONCE AGAIN.

THE MORNING AFTER THAT HE AND JULY WERE TO REREAD THEIR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RAPE. AT HALF PAST NINE I WENT TO THE CAFÉ WHERE HE USUALLY HAD HIS BREAKFAST WITH LILIANE. SHE WAS THERE AND SO WAS JULY BUT THERE WAS NO SARTRE. I LOOKED OVER THE TEXT JULY HAD BROUGHT. IT WAS A DISCONNECTED JUMBLE. AND STILL SARTRE DID NOT APPEAR. AT TEN LILIANE TELEPHONED HIM; HE HAD ONLY JUST AWAKENED. AT LAST HE ARRIVED AND WHEN HE HAD DRUNK A CUP OF COFFEE AND EATEN A LITTLE I TOOK HIM HOME WITH ME. IN TWO HOURS AND A HALF WE HAD DRAWN UP A SUITABLE PIECE AND IT APPEARED IN LIBÉRATION ON NOVEMBER 15. IN THIS ARTICLE SARTRE REFLECTED UPON THE MORAL AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE VIETNAMESE GIRL’S RAPE. IN THE EVENING I READ HIM AN EXCELLENT PAPER BY ORESTE PUCIANI ON HIS—SARTRE’S—AESTHETIC THOUGHT A PAPER IN WHICH HE WAS KEENLY INTERESTED.X THEN WE TRIED TO PLAY DRAUGHTS BUT HE COULD NO LONGER SEE WELL ENOUGH AND WE HAD TO GIVE IT UP. WHAT DISTRESSED ME MOST AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME WAS THAT HE BELIEVED—HE WANTED TO BELIEVE—THAT IN THREE MONTHS TIME HIS EYES WOULD BE CURED.

THE NEW APARTMENT WAS READY; THEY HAD EVEN INSTALLED THE TELEPHONE. SETTLING IN AMUSED HIM. FROM THIS TIME ON I STAYED THERE IN THE EVENING AND FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK I SLEPT IN THE BEDROOM NEXT TO HIS. THE OTHER TWO NIGHTS ARLETTE SLEPT THERE.

SARTRE WENT ON SLEEPING HEAVILY IN THE AFTERNOON; AND EVEN AFTER LONG NIGHTS OF SOUND SLEEP HE WOULD SOMETIMES DROP OFF IN THE MORNING WHILE I WAS READING TO HIM. HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BECOME INDIFFERENT TO MANY THINGS. ONE MORNING AS HE WAS GETTING UP I WIPED A LITTLE SALIVA OFF HIS SHIRT. HE SAID “YES I DRIBBLE. FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW I HAVE BEEN DRIBBLING.” I HAD NOT MENTIONED IT FOR FEAR OF EMBARRASSING HIM BUT HE ATTACHED NO IMPORTANCE TO IT. WHAT DID DISPLEASE HIM A LITTLE WAS HIS DROWSINESS. “IT’S STUPID SLEEPING LIKE THIS.” HE ALSO TOLD ME SADLY “I’M NOT MAKING ANY PROGRESS.” ONE SATURDAY EVENING HE AND SYLVIE AND I WERE INVITED TO EAT COUSCOUS AT GISÈLE HALIMI’S HOME; HE DID NOT UTTER A WORD. AND HE SCARCELY SPOKE WHEN WE HAD LUNCH AT A RESTAURANT WITH LENA EITHER.

I DECIDED TO ASK DR. LAPRESLE FOR AN APPOINTMENT: DR. COURNOT HAD STRONGLY RECOMMENDED HIM. WE WENT TO SEE HIM AT THE BICÊTRE ON NOVEMBER 23. HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SARTRE’S VASCULAR HISTORY AND THE RESULTS HE OBSERVED WHICH WERE VERY GOOD. ACCORDING TO HIM THERE WAS NOTHING PATHOLOGICAL ABOUT THE ENCEPHALOGRAM. AS FOR THE DROWSINESS HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT. HE ORDERED THE KIND OF BRAIN EXAMINATION CALLED A GAMMA-ENCEPHALOGRAM. HE VERY STRONGLY URGED SARTRE TO STOP SMOKING. YOUR SIGHT AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE ARE AT STAKE HE TOLD HIM.

WHEN WE LEFT SARTRE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO ON SMOKING. BUT NEVERTHELESS HE SMOKED LESS THE NEXT DAY AND SYLVIE AND I HAD THE SURPRISE OF A DELIGHTFUL EVENING AN EVENING SUCH AS WE HAD NOT KNOWN FOR A GREAT WHILE. SARTRE TALKED ABOUT FLAUBERT AND THE PROBLEMS OF PASSIVITY; AND HE SAID “IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS I SHALL HAVE GIVEN UP SMOKING COMPLETELY.” LATER HE ALLOWED HIMSELF THREE CIGARETTES A DAY; DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED HE SMOKED EIGHT THEN SEVEN THEN SIX AND HE REACHED HIS THREE. SO HE LIKED LIVING AND HE WAS PREPARED TO STRUGGLE FOR IT.Y

AND INDEED HIS PLEASURE IN LIVING SEEMED TO BE COMING BACK. HE OFTEN SAW HIS YOUNG GREEK FRIEND AND SHE BROUGHT HAPPINESS INTO HIS DAYS. ONE EVENING HE HAD A VERY CHEERFUL DINNER AT THE CLOCHE D’OR WITH TOMIKO SYLVIE AND ME. AND WE HAD SOME VERY AGREEABLE TIMES JUST THE TWO OF US. I READ HIM A COLLECTION OF ARTICLES OF WHICH HE WAS THE SUBJECT AND HE THOUGHT THEM VERY SENSIBLE.

HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS TAKING ON PIERRE VICTOR AS SECRETARY. PUIG WOULD STILL BE HIS ORDINARY SECRETARY; VICTOR WOULD READ ALOUD AND WORK WITH HIM. LILIANE TELEPHONED ME TO SAY THAT SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS DECISION; AND ARLETTE TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS FURIOUS—SHE WAS THINKING OF SCHOENMANN’S RELATIONS WITH RUSSELL AND SHE WAS AFRAID THAT VICTOR MIGHT BECOME SARTRE’S SCHOENMANN.Z BUT SARTRE WAS VERY HAPPY AT THE IDEA OF WORKING WITH VICTOR. AND IT SUITED ME NO LONGER HAVING TO READ ALOUD EVERY MORNING. I HAD A LITTLE TIME TO MYSELF ONCE AGAIN.

AT THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER HE WAS NO WORSE BUT HE WAS NO BETTER EITHER. HE SLEPT. EVEN IN THE MORNING WHEN VICTOR WAS READING TO HIM HE SLEPT. IT WAS A FORM OF ESCAPE I AM SURE. HE COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS NEAR-BLINDNESS. THERE WERE MANY OTHER SIGNS THAT SHOWED THIS REFUSAL. WHEN I ASKED HIM “WHAT DID YOU DO THIS MORNING?” “I READ AND I WORKED.” I STRESSED THE POINT. “WHY DO YOU SAY YOU READ?” “WELL I THOUGHT ABOUT MME BOVARY AND CHARLES AGAIN. I REMEMBER A GREAT DEAL.…”

ONE THURSDAY I WENT WITH HIM TO DR. CIOLEK A YOUNG AND VERY LIKEABLE OPHTHALMOLOGIST. HE LEFT US NO HOPE: THE HEMORRHAGE WAS HEALING OVER BUT IT HAD LEFT INERADICABLE SCARS ON THE MIDDLE OF THE RETINA WHICH WAS NOW DEAD TISSUE. AS WE LEFT SARTRE SAID TO ME “SO I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO READ AGAIN?” HE SAT HUDDLED IN THE TAXI ON THE WAY BACK AND DOZED OFF TO SLEEP. DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED HE WAS NO SADDER THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE. HE HAD HEARD THIS VERDICT BEFORE AND ALTHOUGH HE RAN AWAY FROM THE TRUTH HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS. NOW IN SPITE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE HE STILL WENT ON RUNNING AWAY. FOR EXAMPLE HE WOULD SAY TO ME “NO DON’T TAKE LIBÉRATION. I’LL LOOK AT IT TOMORROW MORNING.” ONE DAY WHEN I HAD MOVED THE LAMP AWAY FROM HIS CHAIR HE ASKED ME TO PUT IT NEARER AGAIN. “YOU SAY THE LIGHT BOTHERS YOU.” “YES BUT I NEED IT WHEN I’M READING.” HE CHECKED HIMSELF. “WELL WHEN I LEAF THROUGH A BOOK.” IN FACT HE COULD NO MORE LEAF THROUGH A BOOK THAN HE COULD READ IT. YET HE ALWAYS WANTED TO HOLD THE NEW ONES I BROUGHT HIM—TO HOLD THEM IN HIS HANDS FOR A MOMENT. INTELLECTUALLY HE WAS TOO NUMBED TO SUFFER MUCH FROM HIS INFIRMITY. WOULD THIS STATE OF BALANCE LAST? AND SHOULD ONE HOPE THAT IT WOULD?

ACCORDING TO HIS GAMMA-ENCEPHALOGRAM THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS BRAIN. YET SOMETIMES HE WOULD UTTER VERY STRANGE WORDS. ONE MORNING WHEN I WAS GIVING HIM HIS MEDICINES HE SAID TO ME “YOU’RE A GOOD WIFE.” AT THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETING ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 12 HE DOZED. STILL HE DID LISTEN CLOSELY THAT EVENING WHEN I READ ALOUD LE MONDE’S REVIEW OF VARIOUS BOOKS ON HIM.

WHEN I WENT TO HIS APARTMENT ON SATURDAY DECEMBER 15 I FOUND HIM SITTING AT HIS WORKTABLE AND IN A HEARTBROKEN VOICE HE SAID “I HAVE NO IDEAS.” HE WAS TO DRAW UP AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF LIBÉRATION WHICH WAS DOING VERY BADLY. I ADVISED HIM TO HAVE A SHORT SLEEP AND AFTERWARD WE BOTH WORKED ON IT TOGETHER. HE FOUND IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE BUT EVEN SO HE GAVE ME THE ESSENTIAL LINES. GAVI CAME FOR THE PAPER AND HE WAS PLEASED WITH IT. A LITTLE LATER I READ SARTRE THE END OF GENEVIÈVE IDT’S EXCELLENT LITTLE BOOK ON THE WORDS. IT FILLED HIM WITH SATISFACTION. BUT THEN ONCE AGAIN HE PIERCED MY HEART. LOOKING AROUND HIS STUDY HE SAID “IT’S ODD TO THINK THAT IT’S MINE THIS APARTMENT.” “IT’S A VERY FINE ONE YOU KNOW.” “I DON’T LIKE IT ANYMORE.” “OH COME. YOU WERE VERY PLEASED WITH IT.” “ONE GETS TIRED OF THINGS.” “YOU TIRE QUICKLY. I’VE BEEN IN MINE EIGHTEEN YEARS NOW AND I LIKE IT STILL.” “YES BUT THIS APARTMENT IS THE PLACE WHERE I DON’T WORK ANYMORE.” A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN I WAS READING HIM A PASSAGE FROM BAUDELAIRE’S CORRESPONDENCE I TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE TO READ A BOOK ON LOUISE COLET. “I’LL DO SO AS SOON AS I’M BACK IN PARIS” HE REPLIED. THEN HE CORRECTED HIMSELF. “AS SOON AS I’VE GOT USED TO THIS WAY OF LIVING.” THIS NEW APARTMENT AND THIS NEW WAY OF LIVING ALL MEANT THAT HE WAS NO LONGER AT EASE NO LONGER IN HIS REAL PLACE.

HE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO BE CLEAR-SIGHTED—TO THINK CLEARLY—BUT NOW AS FAR AS HIS EYES WERE CONCERNED HE WENT ON DENYING WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRUE. WHEN IN ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION I CAUTIOUSLY REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NEVER WHOLLY RECOVER HIS SIGHT HE SAID “I DON’T WANT TO THINK SO. IN ANY CASE I FEEL THAT I AM SEEING RATHER BETTER.” AT LUNCH ONE DAY CONTAT ASKED HIM HOW HE WAS TAKING THINGS AND HE ANSWERED “OBVIOUSLY IT’S BEARABLE ONLY IF YOU THINK IT’S TEMPORARY.”

MOST OF THE TIME HE CONTRIVED TO HIDE THIS ANXIETY. HE AND SYLVIE AND I SAW THE NEW YEAR IN VERY CHEERFULLY INDEED AT MY PLACE. HE WAS BETTER AT THIS PERIOD; HE DOZED LESS AND NOW AND THEN HE WAS ENTIRELY THE SARTRE OF FORMER DAYS—AT THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETING OF JANUARY 2 1974 FOR EXAMPLE. AT OTHER TIMES HE FELL BACK INTO APATHY. WHEN HE CAME HOME ON JANUARY 8 AT ABOUT HALF PAST SEVEN HIS FACE WAS SO DEJECTED SO SET THAT LANZMANN WHO HAD COME TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH US WAS HORROR-STRUCK. WHEN HE LEFT HE KISSED SARTRE AND SARTRE SAID TO HIM “I DON’T KNOW WHETHER YOU’RE KISSING A PIECE OF A TOMB OR A LIVING MAN” WHICH FROZE US THROUGH AND THROUGH. HE SLEPT A LITTLE AND THEN LISTENED TO FRANCE-MUSIQUE. AT THE END OF THE EVENING I ASKED HIM WHAT HE HAD MEANT. “OH NOTHING. IT WAS A JOKE.” I PRESSED HIM. HE FELT EMPTY HE SAID; AT PRESENT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO WORK. THEN HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A LOOK OF ANXIETY AND ALMOST OF SHAME. “SHALL I NEVER GET MY EYES BACK?” I SAID I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NOT. IT WAS SO HEARTRENDING THAT I WEPT ALL NIGHT LONG.

A FEW DAYS LATER DR. LEPRESLE TOLD ME AGAIN OVER THE TELEPHONE THAT SARTRE WAS DOING VERY WELL THAT HE DID NOT NEED TO SEE HIM AGAIN FOR THREE MONTHS AND THAT IT WAS NORMAL THAT HE SHOULD TAKE REFUGE IN SLEEP FROM A TRUTH THAT WAS TOO DISTRESSING TO CONFRONT. I TOLD SARTRE THAT ACCORDING TO LAPRESLE HIS HEALTH WAS EXCELLENT. “AND MY EYES? WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT MY EYES?” THERE WAS A POIGNANT MIXTURE OF INTENSE ANXIETY AND HOPE IN THE QUESTION. “EYES ARE NOT HIS CONCERN” I SAID. “BUT EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED” SAID SARTRE. AND HE WENT TO SLEEP. I WAS SHATTERED. IT IS APPALLING TO WATCH THE DEATH AGONY OF A HOPE.

DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED HE WENT ON DROPPING OFF TO SLEEP WHILE I READ HIM BAUDELAIRE’S LETTERS AND THEN STRINDBERG’S THE SON OF A MAIDSERVANT. WHEN WE WERE HAVING LUNCH WITH SYLVIE HE WAS SO SILENT THAT I SAID “WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?” “NOTHING. I’M NOT HERE.” “WHERE ARE YOU?” “NOWHERE. I’M EMPTY.” THIS KIND OF ABSENCE OFTEN OCCURRED. ONE MORNING AT THE END OF JANUARY I WAS WORKING WITH HIM REVISING ONE OF HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR AND GAVI. HE FELL ASLEEP. HE WAS MORE AND MORE PESSIMISTIC AS FAR AS HIS SIGHT WAS CONCERNED. THE FOG WAS THICKENING HE TOLD ME. HE ALSO SAID WHEN WE WERE LUNCHING TOGETHER AT THE COUPOLE “I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT MY SIGHT WILL NOT GET BETTER.” HE WENT ON “AS FOR THE REST I’M ALL RIGHT.” THEN WITH A TIMID LOOK “I’M AS INTELLIGENT AS I WAS BEFORE?” I SAID YES OF COURSE. AND I ADDED “MY POOR DEAR YOU’RE NOT VERY CHEERFUL.” “THERE’S NOTHING TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT.”

HE HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY STOPPED SMOKING AND ANOTHER DAY I ASKED HIM “DON’T YOU FIND IT BURDENSOME?” “I FIND IT MAKES ME SAD.” ANOTHER TIME HE SAID TO ME “BOST HAS BEEN TALKING TO HIS FRIEND COURNOT. HE SAID THAT AFTER WHAT I HAD HAD IT WOULD TAKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO RECOVER COMPLETELY.” “REALLY? HE TOLD ME TWELVE MONTHS.” AT THIS SARTRE SAID RATHER SHARPLY “YOU DON’T SUPPOSE THAT I SHALL HAVE GOT MY SIGHT BACK IN TWO MONTHS DO YOU?”AA FOR HIM SIGHT AND GENERAL CONDITION WERE ONE.

I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. CIOLEK. HE SAID THAT SARTRE WOULD NOT GO BLIND BUT THAT HE WOULD NEVER RECOVER ANYTHING LIKE CLEAR SHARP SIGHT. I BEGGED HIM NOT TO TELL SARTRE THIS FACT TOO BLUNTLY. WHEN WE WENT TO SEE HIM AT THE END OF JANUARY HE TOLD SARTRE THAT HIS SIGHT HAD NOT GROWN WORSE. BUT WHEN SARTRE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO READ AGAIN CIOLEK WAS EVASIVE. IN THE CORRIDOR SARTRE SAID “HE DIDN’T SEEM TO THINK THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE AGAIN.” HE PAUSED AS THOUGH HIS OWN WORDS HAD SHOCKED HIM; THEN HE ADDED “FOR A LONG TIME YET.”

THE NEXT DAY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE MIGHT TRY TO WORK IN THE MEANTIME. ABRUPTLY JUST BEFORE GOING TO BED HE SAID IN A HARSH VOICE “MY EYES ARE DONE FOR … ACCORDING TO EVERYTHING EVERYBODY TELLS ME.” THE DAY AFTER THAT HE PICKED UP A DETECTIVE STORY THAT WAS LYING ABOUT IN HIS APARTMENT AND PUT IT DOWN UNDER HIS BIG LAMP. “I WANT TO SEE THE TITLE.” HE MADE IT OUT CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH QUITE OFTEN HE COULD NOT READ THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DID NOT PROVE MUCH. HE DID HAVE A CERTAIN MARGIN OF VISION BUT IT WAS VERY MUCH REDUCED. THE NEXT DAY I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE US TO TRY WORKING. “NO NOT YET; NOT RIGHT AWAY.” HE WHO WAS USUALLY SO FAR FROM TOUCHY REACTED AT ONCE WHERE HIS EYES WERE CONCERNED. AS WE WERE GOING ALONG THE COVERED WAY IN THE BIG GARDEN IN THE INNER COURT OF HIS BUILDING I CAUGHT SIGHT OF OUR REFLECTION IN A FAR-OFF GLASS DOOR. “OH IT’S US!” I CRIED LIKE A FOOL. “LET ME BEG OF YOU NOT TO BE THE ALL-SEEING WONDER” HE SAID CROSSLY.

THE MEDICINES HIS DOCTORS STUFFED HIM WITH HAD BROUGHT BACK HIS URINARY INCONTINENCE AND HAD CAUSED HIM TO LOSE CONTROL OF HIS BOWELS. GOING HOME ONE AFTERNOON HE FOULED HIS CLOTHES. I HELPED HIM DEAL WITH THE CATASTROPHE BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT THESE TROUBLES MIGHT GET WORSE AND THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE HIM SUFFER. ZAIDMANN SAID THAT IT WAS THE NORMAL EFFECT OF CERTAIN MEDICINES THAT SARTRE’S BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXCELLENT AND HIS REFLEXES PERFECT.

ONE THING ASTONISHED ME. HE WHO WOULD NEVER GO TO SEE A DOCTOR IN THE OLD DAYS NOW BLAMED CIOLEK AND LAPRESLE FOR NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO HIM. HE WISHED TO SEE THE ROMAN OCULIST AGAIN THE ONE WHO HAD TREATED HIM THE YEAR BEFORE. HE LIKED HIM BECAUSE HE HAD KEPT UP HIS HOPES.

FROM THE INTELLECTUAL POINT OF VIEW HE BEGAN TO IMPROVE IN FEBRUARY. SINCE HE COULD NOT SEE PEOPLE WHEN THERE WERE MANY OF THEM PRESENT HE RETIRED WITHIN HIMSELF. BUT AT THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETING IN FEBRUARY HE SURPRISED EVERYONE BY HIS LIVELY AWARENESS AND HIS INTELLIGENCE. HE PRODUCED GOOD IDEAS FOR ARTICLES AND INVESTIGATIONS.

IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MEETING VIDAL-NAQUET TELEPHONED TO PROTEST AGAINST TWO ARTICLES IN LIBÉRATION WHICH APPEARED ON FEBRUARY 20 AND 21 UNDER THE TITLE “A POINT OF VIEW ON THE SYRIAN PRISONERS IN ISRAEL.” THEY CALLED SARTRE AND ME INTO QUESTION FOR HAVING SIGNED AN APPEAL “FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE ISRAELI PRISONERS IN SYRIA” PUBLISHED IN LE MONDE AND ALSO SIGNED BY FRÉDÉRIC DUPONT MAX LEJEUNE AND CECCALDI-RAYNAUD. WE AT ONCE SENT A CLARIFICATION DENYING ALL SOLIDARITY WITH THE OTHER SIGNATORIES. THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN LIBÉRATION‘S ATTACKS. SARTRE IMMEDIATELY REPLIED TO THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLES IN LIBÉRATION ITSELF ACCUSING THEM OF BAD FAITH.

AT THIS PERIOD HE AGREED TO JOIN LE DANTEC AND LE BRIS (BOTH LIKE HIM FORMER EDITORS OF LA CAUSE DU PEUPLE) IN RUNNING A SERIES CALLED LA FRANCE SAUVAGE WHICH WAS FIRST PUBLISHED BY GALLIMARD AND THEN BY LES PRESSES D’AUJOURD’HUI. TOGETHER THEY DREW UP AN INTRODUCTORY TEXT.

WILD FRANCE. IN A WAY THE “REAL” COUNTRY AS OPPOSED TO THE “LEGAL” COUNTRY. OR AGAIN WILD AS ONE SPEAKS OF A WILDCAT STRIKE. WHICH DOES NOT IMPLY EITHER ARCHAISM OR NECESSARILY VIOLENCE. FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS A QUESTION OF A PROCESS OF EFFERVESCENCE AT A GIVEN POINT OF THE SOCIAL SURFACE AN EFFERVESCENCE THAT INDUCES A SOCIAL GROUP TO RISE UP AND BY AGITATION TO ASSERT ITSELF AS A FREE COMMUNITY OUTSIDE ANY INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT MIGHT CRAMP IT.…

WE CHOOSE HOPE. WE DARE TO MAKE A BET ON A POSSIBLE BREAK A GENERAL MOVEMENT THAT IS CONCEIVABLE ONLY ON THE BASIS OF THE CONVERGENCE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE’S WILD UNTAMED UNREGULATED ACTIVITIES.…

THIS MEANS THAT THE AIM OF OUR COLLECTION IS BOTH MODEST AND AMBITIOUS. MODEST BECAUSE WE MEAN TO BASE OURSELVES ON FACTS AND PERPETUALLY RETURN TO THEM. AMBITIOUS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO US THAT IT IS A PATH BY WHICH A POSSIBLE PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM MAY BE REACHED.

THE FIRST WORK IN THE SERIES WAS ONE BY LE BRIS ON THE LANGUEDOC WHICH I READ ALOUD TO SARTRE AND WHICH WE BOTH FOUND EXCEPTIONALLY INTERESTING. THE LA FRANCE SAUVAGE SERIES WAS TO INCLUDE—AND EVENTUALLY DID INCLUDE—THE COLLECTED CONVERSATIONS OF SARTRE WITH VICTOR AND GAVI THE LAST FEW OF WHICH TOOK PLACE IN MARCH. THEY SUMMED UP THEIR DISCUSSIONS. SARTRE HAD PROFITED BY THEM IN THAT HE HAD “RELEARNED” THE THEORY OF FREEDOM; HE HAD REDISCOVERED “THE POSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING A POLITICAL STRUGGLE CENTERED ON FREEDOM.” AS HE SAW IT “FROM BEGINNING TO END THE DIALOGUE WAS DIRECTED AT THE EVER MORE PRECISE EVER MORE PROGRESSIVE ELUCIDATION OF THE IDEA OF FREEDOM.”

YET SARTRE’S PSYCHOLOGICAL BALANCE WAS STILL UNSTEADY. FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD TRY TO WORK. THIS AMOUNTED TO MAKING ILLEGIBLE MARKS ON PAPER. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY WE HAD LUNCH WITH THE REBEYROLLES. IN A BLIND ALLEY OPENING OUT OF THE RUE FALGUIÈRE THEY HAD AN IMMENSE STUDIO ONE PART OF WHICH WAS VERY PLEASANTLY ARRANGED AS LIVING SPACE WHILE REBEYROLLE WORKED IN THE OTHER. BEFORE THE MEAL HE SHOWED US HIS LATEST CANVASES AND SARTRE OBSERVED SADLY “I CAN’T SEE THEM.” AND HE ADDED “I HOPE I SHALL BE ABLE TO IN A FEW MONTHS.” HE NOW KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT SO; BUT HE WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT TIME WAS ON HIS SIDE.

ON MARCH 17 WE LUNCHED WITH SYLVIE AT L’ESTURGEON A RESTAURANT AT POISSY THAT WE HAD LIKED WHEN WE WERE YOUNG BECAUSE OF ITS ENCLOSED TERRACE THAT OVERHUNG THE SEINE AND THAT HAD A BIG TREE GROWING THROUGH IT. SARTRE WAS DELIGHTED TO BE THERE. HE THOUGHT THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT WHICH WAS MOST UNUSUAL FOR HIM. YET AS IT SO OFTEN HAPPENED HE WAS FAR AWAY. THAT EVENING HE LEFT FOR JUNAS WITH ARLETTE WHO TELEPHONED ME ON THE FOLLOWING DAYS; HE WAS WELL AND HE SLEPT A GREAT DEAL.

“NOW MY REAL VACATION IS GOING TO BEGIN” HE SAID TO ME SOME DAYS LATER WHEN WE MET AT AVIGNON. WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR VENICE WITH SYLVIE. A TRAIN TOOK US TO MILAN AND THERE AS USUAL WE WENT TO THE HOTEL DE LA SCALA. WE HAD STAYED THERE IN 1946 WHEN WE SO HAPPILY REDISCOVERED ITALY. ANOTHER TRAIN TOOK US TO VENICE WHERE A GONDOLA CARRIED US TO THE HOTEL MONACO ON THE GRAND CANAL NEAR SAINT MARK’S QUAY WHERE WE HAD ROOMS LOOKING ONTO THE CANAL ITSELF. IN THE MORNINGS I HAD BREAKFAST WITH SARTRE IN HIS ROOM AND I READ ALOUD TO HIM. AT ABOUT ONE WE ATE A SANDWICH EITHER ON THE QUAY IN THE SUN OR INDOORS AT FLORIAN’S ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER WHICH WAS MOST UNSETTLED SOMETIMES VERY FINE SOMETIMES OVERCAST—A THICK FOG OFTEN DROWNED SAINT MARK’S SQUARE IN THE EVENING. WHILE SARTRE SLEPT IN THE AFTERNOON I WENT FOR A WALK WITH SYLVIE AND TOWARD FIVE O’CLOCK WE WOULD ALL THREE GO OUT TOGETHER. I SHOWED SARTRE THE FORMER GHETTO; WE LOOKED AT THE RIALTO QUARTER AGAIN; AND WE WENT TO THE LIDO. ALL THE HOTELS WERE CLOSED AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY WE FOUND A LITTLE RESTAURANT ON THE SHORE WHERE WE ATE A MEAGER LUNCH ENVELOPED IN A WARM MIST. IN THE EVENING WE ALL THREE HAD DINNER AT ONE OF THE PLACES WE LIKED AND THEN DRANK A GLASS OF WHISKEY IN THE HOTEL BAR.

SARTRE ALWAYS FELT WELL IN VENICE BUT NOW FROM TIME TO TIME HE GREW UNEASY. ONE MORNING WHEN I WAS READING TO HIM IN HIS ROOM IT WAS SO FINE THAT WE DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE TERRACE ON THE WATER’S EDGE: I MADE AS IF TO TAKE THE BOOK. “WHAT FOR?” HE ASKED. THEN HE ADDED “BEFORE WHEN I WAS MORE INTELLIGENT WE DIDN’T READ. WE TALKED.” I PROTESTED THAT I ONLY READ TO HIM BECAUSE OF HIS EYES; AND DOWN THERE ON THE TERRACE IN THE SUN WE TALKED. HE HAD IN FACT RETAINED HIS INTELLIGENCE; HE MADE REMARKS ABOUT WHAT WE READ AND DISCUSSED THE BOOKS. BUT HE WOULD LET THE CONVERSATION DROP QUITE SOON; HE DID NOT ASK QUESTIONS NOR DID HE OFFER FRESH IDEAS. NOT MANY THINGS INTERESTED HIM ON ANY LEVEL. BUT BY WAY OF COMPENSATION HE GREW VERY SET IN HIS WAYS MAKING IT A RULE TO KEEP TO GIVEN SEQUENCES REPLACING REAL PLEASURE IN THINGS BY OBSTINATE ADHERENCE TO A PATTERN.

A NEWSPAPER PUBLISHED A PHOTOGRAPH OF US GIVING THE NAME OF OUR HOTEL. A FEW TROUBLESOME PEOPLE TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US BUT WE ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MONDADORIAB WHO CAME TO HAVE A DRINK WITH US AT THE BAR OF THE HOTEL. HE HAD A BEARD HE HAD AGED AND HE STAMMERED A GREAT DEAL. HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE THE BEAUTIFUL VIRGINIA. A FRIEND CAME WITH HIM A MUSICIAN WHO WAS CONDUCTING DONIZETTI’S LAST OPERA MARIA DI ROHAN AT THE FENICE. THE FINAL PERFORMANCE WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE NEXT DAY. THE THEATER WAS FULLY BOOKED BUT EVEN SO THEY FOUND US THREE PLACES IN THE ROYAL BOX. WE WERE ENCHANTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BEL CANTO AND THE EXCELLENT PERFORMERS. BUT FOR SARTRE THE STAGE WAS NO MORE THAN A BLACK HOLE WHICH SADDENED HIM. GENERALLY SPEAKING HE WAS WORRYING MORE THAN EVER ABOUT HIS EYES PERHAPS BECAUSE MORE THAN EVER HE WANTED TO SEE. WHEN I ASKED HIM AS WE WERE LEAVING WHETHER HE HAD HAD A GOOD STAY HE WARMLY REPLIED “OH YES!” BUT HE ADDED “EXCEPT FOR MY EYES.”

ON THE EVENING OF TUESDAY APRIL 2 WE GOT INTO TWO COMMUNICATING SLEEPING-CAR COMPARTMENTS WHERE WE ATE CROISSANTS WITH HAM AND DRANK MERLOT. THE ITALIAN RAILWAYMEN WERE ON STRIKE AND WE MOVED OFF AN HOUR LATE. IN THE MORNING THE STEWARD BROUGHT US OUR BREAKFAST AND TOLD US OF POMPIDOU’S DEATH. SOME FRENCH TRAVELERS WERE PANIC-STRICKEN; THEY SAW ANARCHY BREAKING OUT. ONE DEEPLY DISTURBED WOMAN WAILED “THE STOCK EXCHANGE WILL UTTERLY COLLAPSE!”

IN ORDER NOT TO GO BACK TO HIS PARIS WAYS AT ONCE SARTRE STAYED A FEW DAYS WITH ME. ON SATURDAY MORNING I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE CIOLEK. THE OCULAR PRESSURE WAS GOOD; THERE WAS NO MORE HEMORRHAGING. IT WAS NATURAL THAT AT THE THEATER HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO DAZZLED BY THE LIGHTS ON THE STAGE THAT HE SAW NOTHING. AS HE LEFT SARTRE WAS QUITE PLEASED. “ALL IN ALL I AM WELL. EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER.” HE WENT ON BUT WITHOUT APPARENT DEJECTION “HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT I SHALL NEVER ENTIRELY RECOVER MY SIGHT.” “NO YOU WILL NOT RECOVER IT ALL” I SAID LEAVING THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD OR WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED UNDEFINED. HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME SARTRE SPOKE OF CIOLEK WITHOUT DISLIKE. I THINK THAT IN VENICE HE HAD BEEN AFRAID OF GOING COMPLETELY BLIND AND NOW HE WAS RELIEVED TO KNOW THAT HIS SIGHT WAS STABILIZED. YET EVEN SO HAVING SEEN THE DIABETES SPECIALIST AND DR. LEPRESLE WHO WERE BOTH SATISFIED WITH HIS HEALTH AND WHO REDUCED THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS SARTRE STILL SAID IN A VERY SAD VOICE “MY EYES? I SHALL NOT GET THEM BACK.”

IN SPITE OF SPRINGLIKE AND EVEN SUMMERLIKE WEATHER HE WAS RATHER GLOOMY. “I HAVE THE FEELING OF PERPETUALLY LIVING THE SAME DAY OVER AGAIN. I SEE YOU I SEE ARLETTE VARIOUS DOCTORS … AND THEN IT IS ALL REPEATED.” HE ADDED “EVEN AS FAR AS THE ELECTIONS ARE CONCERNED … PEOPLE COME TO FETCH ME AND THEY GET ME TO SPEAK; BUT IT’S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ALGERIAN WAR.” I TOLD HIM I HAD MUCH THE SAME IMPRESSION WITH THE FEMINISTS. “IT’S AGE” HE CONCLUDED NOT TOO SADLY.

ON APRIL 13 AND 14 SARTRE GAVE LIBÉRATION AN INTERVIEW ON THE ELECTIONS. HE WANTED CHARLES PIAGET TO BE A CANDIDATE. (PIAGET WAS THE MAN WHO ORGANIZED THE LIP WORKERS’ STRUGGLE AND SARTRE HAD FOLLOWED THEIR ADVENTURES WITH CLOSE ATTENTION.) HE STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT VOTE FOR MITTERRAND. “IN MY OPINION THE UNION OF THE LEFT IS A JOKE” HE SAID. IN A CONVERSATION WITH GAVI AND VICTOR HE SIDED AGAINST THE CLASSIC LEFT WING. “I CAN’T SEE THAT LEFT-WING GOVERNMENTS COULD TOLERATE OUR WAY OF THINKING. I CAN’T SEE WHY WE SHOULD CAST OUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF PEOPLE WHOSE ONE IDEA IS TO KNOCK OUR HEADS OFF.” HE SAID THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY VOTE FOR PIAGET BECAUSE HE WAS SURE HE WOULD NEVER BE ELECTED. “I DON’T KNOW THAT I SHOULD VOTE FOR PIAGET IF PIAGET HAD A CHANCE OF GETTING IN” HE ENDED LAUGHING.

ON APRIL 28 HE WENT TO BRUAY WITH GAVI AND VICTOR TO INTRODUCE THE HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED BOOK ON A RAISON DE SE RÉVOLTER (TO REBEL IS JUSTIFIED) WHICH THEY HAD JUST FINISHED. THERE WAS A JUSTICE ET LIBERTÉ COMMITTEE AT BRUAY AND IT HAD INVITED THEM. HE DID SEE FORMER MILITANTS BUT THE MEETING WAS NOT VERY USEFUL. THE BOOK CAME OUT EARLY IN MAY AS PART OF THE LA FRANCE SAUVAGE COLLECTION. LE MONDE AT ONCE GAVE IT TWO VERY FAVORABLE REVIEWS. SARTRE DISCUSSED IT WITH VICTOR GAVI AND MARCUSE WHOM HE NOW MET FOR THE FIRST TIME. HIS GREEK FRIEND WAS PRESENT AT THE CONVERSATION AND SHE WROTE AN ACCOUNT OF IT FOR LIBÉRATION. ON MAY 24 HE SENT THE PAPER A MESSAGE RESIGNING HIS POST AS EDITOR. BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH HE GAVE UP ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HE HAD TAKEN ON IN THE LEFTIST PRESS.

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 1974 HE HAD SIGNED MANY PROTESTS. ONE WAS IN LIBÉRATION IN JANUARY—A TEXT DRAWN UP BY THE G.I.A. (GROUPE D’INFORMATIONS ASILES) ON THE SUBJECT OF JÉRÔME DURAN A MAN FROM THE FRENCH WEST INDIES WRONGFULLY CONFINED IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM AT AMIENS. ON MARCH 27 IN THE SAME PAPER AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALAIN MOREAU A COMMUNIQUÉ APPEARED REFERRING TO ALEXANDRE SANGUINETTI’S COMPLAINT AGAINST ALAIN MOREAU’S INTERVIEW PUBLISHED IN LIBÉRATION ON JANUARY 9.

AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE SARTRE WAS REALLY WELL. INDEED I THOUGHT HIM “TRANSFORMED.” HE NO LONGER DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP; HE WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT HIMSELF AND HE WAS NOW REFLECTING ON IT. WE TALKED AS WE USED TO TALK IN FORMER TIMES. WE SPENT VERY LIVELY EVENINGS WITH SYLVIE AND ON ONE OCCASION WE HAD A REALLY CHEERFUL DINNER WITH ALICE SCHWARZER. ONE DAY I SUGGESTED THAT DURING THE VACATION WE SHOULD TAPE-RECORD TALKS CONCERNING LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY PRIVATE LIFE. HE AGREED. “THAT WILL COPE WITH THIS” HE SAID POINTING TO HIS EYE WITH A HEARTBREAKING GESTURE.

ONE EVENING SYLVIE TOOK US TO THE OPERA TO HEAR THE SICILIAN VESPERS. SARTRE WORE A WHITE SHIRT AND A TIE BOUGHT FOR THE OCCASION. FOR HIM THIS WAS A SORT OF FANCY DRESS AND IT AMUSED HIM. HE LIKED THE SHOW. THE CASTING WAS NOT ALL THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT THERE WERE SOME VERY FINE ARIAS AND THE CHORUSES WERE SPLENDID. THE PRODUCTION THE SCENERY AND THE COSTUMES WERE OUTSTANDING. UNHAPPILY THEIR BEAUTY MORE OR LESS ESCAPED SARTRE ALTHOUGH HE SAW BETTER THAN HE HAD AT VENICE. BUT FOR ALL THAT HE WAS VERY CHEERFUL WHEN WE HAD SUPPER AFTERWARD AT THE CLOCHE D’OR.

ON THE EVENING OF THE ELECTIONS SARTRE CAME FIRST TO MY HOUSE AND GAVE SYLVIE A RECORDING OF THE VERDI OPERA AND THEN WE WENT TO LANZMANN’S TO FOLLOW THE RESULTS ON TELEVISION. THEY DID NOT REALLY MOVE US MUCH. IT WAS NO GREAT MISFORTUNE THAT POMPIDOU’S DISASTROUS INHERITANCE SHOULD FALL TO GISCARD.

DURING THESE LAST DAYS OF JUNE SARTRE CONTINUED TO BE WELL. HE SEEMED ALMOST RESIGNED TO HIS HALF-BLINDNESS. WITH SYLVIE WE CELEBRATED HIS SIXTY-NINTH BIRTHDAY AND HE DID FULL JUSTICE TO THE DELICIOUS DINNER SHE HAD COOKED. WE DRANK HIS HEALTH WITH THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM.

HE HAD ONLY ONE CAUSE FOR ANXIETY. HS FRIEND THE GREEK GIRL SEEMED NOT ONLY MUCH OVEREXCITED BUT ACTUALLY TO BE GOING MAD IN THE FULL SENSE OF THE WORD. SHE MADE A PUBLIC SCENE IN AN AUTEUIL STREET AND SHE WAS CARRIED OFF TO SAINT ANNE’S WHICH SHE LEFT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THE PSYCHIATRIST TOLD US THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A QUESTION OF NOTHING MORE THAN A BOUFFÉE DÉLIRANTE A TRANSITORY DELUSIONAL STATE BUT SHE SEEMED MORE DEEPLY AFFECTED THAN THAT WHEN I WENT TO THE BOULEVARD HOURDAIN WITH SARTRE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 5. I WAITED IN A LITTLE ROOM WHILE HE WENT TO SEE HER AND THEY JOINED ME AN HOUR LATER. SHE WAS WEARING A LONG WHITE NIGHTGOWN HER HAIR FLOATED FREE HER FACE HAD GROWN THINNER AND SHE LOOKED THE VERY IMAGE OF THE CLASSIC MADWOMAN AS MOVIES SHOW HER. SHE GREETED ME WITH HER USUAL POLITENESS. SARTRE AND I CALLED A TAXI AND WENT TO HAVE LUNCH AT BALZAR’S. HIS INTERVIEW WITH MELINA HAD QUITE STAGGERED HIM. SHE HAD BEEN HOSTILE ACCUSING HIM OF HAVING ARRANGED HER CONFINEMENT AND INSISTING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LET HER OUT. HE PROTESTED. “YOU CERTAINLY HAD ALTHUSSER SHUT UP” SHE RETORTED. (AT THE SORBONNE SHE HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE LECTURES OF ALTHUSSER WHO HAD JUST BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN). HER FATHER SUMMONED TO PARIS WAS TO TAKE HER BACK TO GREECE IN A FEW DAYS TIME. “I DON’T THINK I SHALL EVER SEE HER AGAIN” SAID SARTRE REGRETFULLY. I FELT WRETCHED AT LEAVING HIM UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. SYLVIE CAME TO GET US AND WE LEFT SARTRE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING WHERE ARLETTE LIVED; HE WAS TO SET OFF WITH HER FOR JUNAS THAT EVENING. IN HIS HAND HE HELD A PLASTIC BAG IN WHICH I HAD PACKED HIS TOILET THINGS. HE LOOKED AT US THROUGH A CURTAIN OF RAIN AND HIS OWN PRIVATE MISTS.

I TRAVELED IN SPAIN WITH SYLVIE REASSURED ABOUT SARTRE’S HEALTH BY TELEGRAMS FROM JUNAS PARIS AND FLORENCE WHERE HE WAS STAYING WITH WANDA. THE JOURNEY ENDED BADLY. AT MONTPELLIER AS WE WERE ON OUR WAY FROM SPAIN TO ITALY SYLVIE HEARD OF HER FATHER’S DEATH STRUCK DOWN BY A HEART ATTACK. LEAVING ME AT AVIGNON SHE SET OFF FOR BRITTANY AND I WENT ON TO FLORENCE BY TRAIN.

WHEN I SAW SARTRE AGAIN IN THE HALL OF HIS HOTEL I SCARCELY RECOGNIZED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS CAP AND A THICK WHITE MOSS THAT HID HIS CHIN. HE COULD NOT MANAGE SHAVING AND NOTHING ON EARTH WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO TO A BARBER. IN THE TRAIN THAT WAS TAKING US TO ROME HE DOZED. BUT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN WE WERE IN OUR TERRACE APARTMENT ONCE MORE I SAW WITH PLEASURE THAT HE WAS INDEED WELL. THE HOTEL BARBER SUCCEEDED IN WINNING HIS CONFIDENCE; HE LET THE MAN SHAVE HIM AND THIS MADE HIM LOOK MUCH YOUNGER. AFTER THAT HE SHAVED HIMSELF PERFECTLY WELL WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR THAT SYLVIE BOUGHT HIM WHEN SHE JOINED US AGAIN SOME DAYS LATER.

SHE TAUGHT ME TO USE A TAPE RECORDER AND I BEGAN THE SERIES OF DIALOGUES WITH SARTRE THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IN PARIS. HE TOOK PART IN THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY EXCEPT ON SOME DAYS WHEN HE WAS RATHER TIRED AND WE MADE LITTLE HEADWAY. APART FROM THIS INNOVATION OUR LIFE HAD PRETTY WELL THE SAME RHYTHM AS IN FORMER YEARS—SHORT WALKS MUSIC THE READING OF PAPERS AND A FEW BOOKS. AMONG OTHERS I READ SARTRE SOLZHENITSYN’S GULAG ARCHIPELAGO AND FEST’S HITLER. IN THE EVENINGS WE HAD DINNER ON THE TERRACE OF ONE OF OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANTS.

ONE NIGHT AS WE WERE COMING BACK ON FOOT THROUGH THE NARROW DARK STREETS A HAND CAME OUT OF A CAR THAT WAS PASSING US AND GRABBED MY BAG. I TRIED TO HOLD ON BUT IN SPITE OF MY EFFORTS IT WAS TORN FROM ME AND I FELL FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND. SYLVIE AND SARTRE HELPED ME BACK TO THE HOTEL WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR. THEY CALLED A DOCTOR AT ONCE AND HE TOLD ME THAT MY LEFT ARM WAS DISLOCATED. HE BANDAGED IT AND THE NEXT DAY I HAD IT PUT IN A CAST. THERE WERE A GREAT MANY OF THESE ATTACKS THAT YEAR AND WE NEVER WENT OUT ON FOOT IN THE EVENING AGAIN.

SYLVIE TOOK THE CAR BACK TO PARIS. THE BOSTS CAME TO SEE US STAYING ONLY A LITTLE WHILE. AS WE WERE NOW BY OURSELVES WE RECORDED SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS. WE RARELY WENT OUT BECAUSE HEAVY RAIN AND VIOLENT STORMS CAME IN MID-SEPTEMBER.

WE WENT BACK TO PARIS ON SEPTEMBER 22 AND SARTRE RETURNED WITHOUT PLEASURE TO THAT DWELLING WHERE HE “NO LONGER WORKED.” SYLVIE WENT THERE TO SPEND AN EVENING AND HE SAID TO HER “HAVE YOU COME TO SEE THE DEAD MAN’S HOUSE?” AND A LITTLE LATER WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM HE REPLIED “WHY YES I’M A LIVING CORPSE.” THIS WAS BEFORE HE RETURNED TO ANY ACTIVITY. ONCE HE HAD DONE SO HE WAS MUCH MORE LIVING THAN DEAD. WE WENT ON WITH OUR DIALOGUES AND HE SAID THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY HAPPY. FINALLY HE HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF EVEN TO HIS HALF-BLINDNESS AND HE WAS PROUD OF HAVING ADAPTED TO IT SO WELL. ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS HE TOOK WAS TO SEND GISCARD D’ESTAING A LETTER ASKING THAT BENNI LÉVI (PIERRE VICTOR) MIGHT BE NATURALIZED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ON SEPTEMBER 30 GISCARD REPLIED WITH A LETTER IN HIS OWN HAND—A LETTER IN WHICH HE AVOIDED CALLING SARTRE MAÎTREAC—PROMISING TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED NATURALIZATION VERY QUICKLY AND ENDING “JUDGING BY YOUR WRITINGS EVERYTHING SEEMS TO SET US VERY FAR APART FROM ONE ANOTHER. I AM NOT SO SURE OF THAT AS YOU ARE. I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT MEN WERE TO BE CLASSIFIED SOLELY ACCORDING TO THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THEY ARRIVE AT. THERE IS ALSO THEIR QUEST TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL.” THE NATURALIZATION CAME THROUGH QUICKLY AND SARTRE WROTE A SHORT LETTER OF THANKS.AD VICTOR CELEBRATED THE OCCASION BY GIVING A PARTY FOR ALL HIS CLOSE FRIENDS AND SINCE SARTRE AND I INTENDED TO BE THERE LILIANE SIEGEL LENT HER APARTMENT SO THAT THINGS SHOULD BE EASIER FOR US.

SARTRE WENT BACK TO ATTENDING THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETINGS. ALL THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT ON OCTOBER 2—ETCHERELLI POUILLON AND HORST—THOUGHT HE WAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED. HE SAW THE LIBERATION TEAM ONCE MORE. ON OCTOBER 15 LE MONDE CARRIED AN APPEAL BY SARTRE AND JULY WRITTEN BY THE LATTER AND ENTITLED “SAVE LIBÉRATION.” THE PAPER CRUSHED BY DEBTS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SUSPEND PUBLICATION. SARTRE AND JULY APPEALED TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE SEVENTY-SEVEN MILLION OLD FRANCSAE NEEDED FOR ITS SURVIVAL. HE CONTINUED HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH VICTOR AND HAD A GREAT MANY APPOINTMENTS. IN THE AFTERNOONS AND SOME EVENINGS I READ HIM THE BOOKS HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT (GRAMSCI’S POLITICAL WRITINGS A REPORT ON CHILE THE MOST RECENT ISSUES OF LES TEMPS MODERNES A WORK ON SURREALISM AND DREAMS AND QUENTIN BELL’S BIOGRAPHY OF VIRGINIA WOOLF). HE NO LONGER DOZED OFF AND HE HAD ALMOST PERFECTLY ADAPTED HIS MOTIONS AS FAR AS EATING SMOKING AND WALKING ABOUT WERE CONCERNED. “EVERYTHING’S FINE I PROMISE YOU” HE SAID TO ME KINDLY. “YOU READ TO ME; WE WORK; I CAN SEE WELL ENOUGH TO MOVE ABOUT. EVERYTHING’S FINE.” I ADMIRED HIM FOR THE SERENITY OF MIND HE HAD REGAINED. (WHAT SERENITY IN POINT OF FACT? WAS IT THE PROUD ACQUIESCENCE OF THE SAGE? AN OLD MAN’S INDIFFERENCE? THE DESIRE NOT TO BE BURDENSOME TO OTHERS? HOW CAN ONE TELL? I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THESE STATES OF MIND CANNOT BE PUT INTO WORDS. PRIDE WISDOM AND CARE FOR THOSE AROUND HIM FORBADE SARTRE TO COMPLAIN EVEN TO HIMSELF. BUT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS WHAT DID HE FEEL? NO ONE COULD HAVE ANSWERED NOT EVEN HE.)

ON NOVEMBER 16 SARTRE SIGNED A DECLARATION BREAKING WITH UNESCO WHICH REFUSED TO INCLUDE ISRAEL IN ANY GIVEN REGION OF THE WORLD. IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLAVEL ACTING AS AN INTERMEDIARY SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR ON TELEVISION IN A SERIES OF TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF. HE BEGAN BY SAYING NO. UP UNTIL THEN APART FROM ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS HE HAD DECLINED TO MAKE ANY PERSONAL APPEARANCES ON TELEVISION IN ORDER NOT TO GIVE A STATE ORGANIZATION HIS BACKING.AF BUT WHEN HE HAD TALKED IT OVER WITH VICTOR AND GAVI HE HAD THE IDEA OF DOING PROGRAMS ON THE HISTORY OF THIS CENTURY AS HE HAD KNOWN IT OR COME CLOSE TO IT SINCE HIS BIRTH. I AGREED. HE HOPED TO INFLUENCE THE PUBLIC BRINGING ABOUT A RENEWAL IN DEPTH OF THE WAY IN WHICH OUR RECENT HISTORY WAS SEEN. MARCEL JULLIAN THE CHIEF OF ANTENNE 2 SEEMED TO BE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN—WITH SUCH A SERIES GISCARD’S TELEVISION WOULD PROVE THAT IT WAS BECOMING LIBERAL. ON NOVEMBER 19 SARTRE GAVE LIBÉRATION AN INTERVIEW ON THE SUBJECT. HE HAD FEW ILLUSIONS. “WE’LL SEE JUST HOW FAR WE CAN GO” HE SAID.

FOR THE MOMENT THERE WERE OTHER MATTERS THAT INTERESTED HIM DEEPLY. IN THE LIBÉRATION OF NOVEMBER 21 HE PUBLISHED A LETTER PROTESTING AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES’ REFUSAL TO LET HIM SEE ANDREAS BAADER. THIS WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HE FELT DEEPLY COMMITTED. HE HAD GIVEN DER SPIEGEL AN INTERVIEW IN FEBRUARY 1973 AND IN IT HE HAD TO SOME DEGREE JUSTIFIED THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC’S ACTIONS. THEN IN MARCH 1974 LES TEMPS MODERNES PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE BY SJEF TEUNS ON THE “TORTURE BY SENSORIAL DEPRIVATION” WHICH WAS BEING INFLICTED ON BAADER AND HIS COMPANIONS; THE SAME ISSUE HAD AN ANONYMOUS ARTICLE ON “SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF TORTURE” AND ANOTHER BY KLAUS CROISSANT BAADER’S LAWYER ENTITLED “TORTURE BY ISOLATION.” AFTER THAT KLAUS CROISSANT HAD ASKED SARTRE TO GO AND SEE FOR HIMSELF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH BAADER WAS IMPRISONED AND HE HAD DETERMINED TO DO SO. ON NOVEMBER 4 HE APPLIED FOR PERMISSION TO SEE BAADER IN HIS PRISON WITH DANIEL COHN-BENDIT AS INTERPRETER. HIS DETERMINATION WAS STRENGTHENED BY HOLGER MEINS’ DEATH IN PRISON ON NOVEMBER 9 AFTER HIS HUNGER STRIKE. SARTRE’S LETTER IN LIBÉRATION SPOKE OF THE GERMAN REFUSAL AS “MERELY PLAYING FOR TIME.” SHORTLY AFTER ITS PUBLICATION ALICE SCHWARZER CAME AND ASKED HIM ON BEHALF OF DER SPIEGEL FOR AN INTERVIEW ON THE SUBJECT. THIS APPEARED ON DECEMBER 2. SARTRE HAD AT LAST OBTAINED PERMISSION TO TALK TO BAADER AND HE NOW EXPLAINED THE REASONS FOR HIS INTERVENTION. HE DISAPPROVED OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC’S VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE PRESENT GERMAN CONTEXT BUT HE WISHED TO SHOW HIS SOLIDARITY WITH AN IMPRISONED REVOLUTIONARY MILITANT AND TO PROTEST AGAINST THE TREATMENT INFLICTED ON HIM.

ON DECEMBER 4 THEREFORE HE WENT TO STUTTGART AND TOGETHER WITH PIERRE VICTOR KLAUS CROISSANT AND COHN-BENDIT HE TALKED WITH BAADER FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. THE CAR THAT TOOK HIM TO THE PRISON AT STAMMHEIM WAS DRIVEN BY BOMMI BAUMANN A REPENTANT TERRORIST WHO GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES IN THE LA FRANCE SAUVAGE COLLECTION.AG THE SAME DAY SARTRE GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE EXTRACTS FROM WHICH APPEARED IN LIBÉRATION AND LE MONDE AND TOGETHER WITH HEINRICH BÖLL HE APPEARED ON TELEVISION TO LAUNCH AN APPEAL FOR THE SETTING UP OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PROTECT POLITICAL PRISONERS. HIS ACTION PROVOKED A VIOLENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC. HE GAVE ANOTHER PRESS CONFERENCE IN PARIS ON DECEMBER 10 AT WHICH KLAUS CROISSANT AND ALAIN GEISMAR WERE ALSO PRESENT. LATER IN THE TELEVISION PROGRAM SATELLITE OF MAY 22 1975 HE DEVOTED AN INTERVIEW TO BAADER. HE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS GOING TO STAMMHEIM. “I THINK THE VISIT WAS A FAILURE” HE SAID. “GERMAN PUBLIC OPINION DID NOT CHANGE. INDEED THE VISIT MAY EVEN HAVE TURNED IT AGAINST THE CAUSE I MEANT TO SUPPORT. IT WAS QUITE IN VAIN FOR ME TO SAY THAT I WAS REFLECTING NOT UPON THE DEEDS FOR WHICH BAADER WAS BLAMED BUT ONLY UPON THE CONDITIONS OF HIS IMPRISONMENT—THE JOURNALISTS THOUGHT I WAS SUPPORTING HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. I THINK IT WAS A FAILURE BUT IN SPITE OF THAT IF IT WERE TO BE DONE AGAIN I SHOULD DO IT.”AH ELSEWHERE HE SAID “WHAT INTERESTS ME IS THE MOTIVES BEHIND THE GROUP’S ACTION ITS HOPES ITS ACTIVITIES AND BROADLY SPEAKING ITS MEMBERS’ POLITICAL IDEA.”

ON DECEMBER 2 JUST BEFORE THEY LEFT FOR GERMANY SARTRE VICTOR AND GAVI INTRODUCED ON A RAISON DE SE RÉVOLTER (TO REBEL IS JUSTIFIED) DURING A DEBATE THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE COUR DES MIRACLES. THIS WAS A MEETING PLACE FINANCED BY ONE OF GEORGES MICHEL’S FRIENDS WHO HAD APPOINTED HIM ARTISTIC DIRECTOR. GEORGES MICHEL HAD DISCOVERED THE PLACE AND HAD ADAPTED IT WITH THE HELP OF SOME ARCHITECT FRIENDS OF HIS. THERE WAS A CINEMA A THEATER ARTISANS’ SHOPS AND A VERY CHEAP CAFETERIA. ON THIS OCCASION AND SUBSEQUENTLY ON MANY OTHERS GEORGES MICHEL PLACED THE THEATER AT SARTRE’S DISPOSAL.

AT THIS PERIOD SARTRE WAS VERY BUSY. ON DECEMBER 17 AT LA MAISON DU JAPON HE TALKED TO STUDENTS WHO WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS PHILOSOPHY AND HIS POLITICS. MICHEL CONTAT RECORDED WHAT HE HAD SAID AND THE TEXT APPEARED IN A JAPANESE PERIODICAL IN 1975. HE SIGNED AN APPEAL CALLING FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE SOLDIERS IMPRISONED FOR HAVING CLAIMED DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS WITHIN THE ARMY. ON DECEMBER 28 AFTER AN ACCIDENT THAT KILLED FORTY-THREE MEN IN THE LIÉVIN MINE SARTRE REPRINTED HIS LENS INDICTMENT OF THE HOUILLÈRES IN LIBÉRATION ADDING A SHORT PIECE IN WHICH HE PASSED THIS DOCUMENT ON TO PASCAL THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE. TOGETHER WITH FOUCAULT HE GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE SUBJECT.

HIS CHIEF OCCUPATION WAS TALKING OVER THE PROGRAMS WE WANTED TO CREATE FOR TELEVISION. HE DISCUSSED THEM THREE TIMES A WEEK WITH VICTOR GAVI AND ME. WE HAD STOPPED WORKING ON OUR DIALOGUES AND A TYPIST HAD BEGUN TO TRANSCRIBE THEM THOUGH WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF OUR RAPID FLOW OF WORDS AND THE WAY THE BELLS OF ROME BROKE LOUDLY INTO OUR CONVERSATON. WE WERE ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH PLANNING THESE PROGRAMS. APART FROM THE TIMES WHEN ALL MET TO WORK SARTRE AND I TALKED ABOUT THEM A GREAT DEAL AND IN HIS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE HAND HE NOTED DOWN REFLECTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS. FOR HIS PART BETWEEN OUR MEETINGS VICTOR PUT HIS IDEAS DOWN ON PAPER AND ESTABLISHED CONTACTS. WE PLANNED TO PRODUCE TEN PROGRAMS ON THE HISTORY OF THE CENTURY EACH LASTING SEVENTY-FIVE MINUTES FOLLOWED BY FIFTEEN MINUTES DEVOTED TO PRESENT-DAY PROBLEMS LINKED TO THE MAIN THEME. IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS WE MANAGED TO OUTLINE SIX SYNOPSES; GIVING THEM THEIR FULL SUBSTANCE WOULD REQUIRE THE COLLABORATION OF HISTORIANS AND WE TURNED TO YOUNG RESEARCH WORKERS MANY OF WHOM WERE FRIENDS OF VICTOR AND GAVI.

1975
THE FIRST QUESTION WAS WHO WAS TO PRODUCE THE SERIES? SARTRE WOULD HAVE LIKED TRUFFAUT TO WORK WITH HIM. LILIANE SIEGEL KNEW TRUFFAUT WELL AND ON DECEMBER 31 SHE BROUGHT HIM TO SEE SARTRE. TRUFFAUT WAS NOT AVAILABLE. HE ADVISED SARTRE TO SPEAK TO ROGER LOUIS WHO HAD CONSIDERABLE MEANS AT HIS DISPOSAL. ROGER LOUIS A STAR REPORTER AND PRODUCER ON TELEVISION HAD RESIGNED IN 1968 GIVING HIS REASONS IN A VERY LIVELY LITTLE BOOK O.R.T.F. MON COMBAT. HE HAD THEN FOUNDED SCOPCOLOR AN INDEPENDENT COOPERATIVE FOR PRODUCTIONS THAT HAD VAST PREMISES AT BELLEVILLE. HE AGREED TO HELP US IN OUR UNDERTAKING WHICH THUS ESCAPED OFFICIAL SUPERVISION. NEGOTIATIONS WITH EDELINEAI ALLOWED US TO DO WITHOUT HIS TEAM OF TECHNICIANS AND WE BECAME AUTONOMOUS. WE STILL HAD TO CHOOSE DIRECTORS. I THOUGHT OF LUNTZ WHOSE LES COEURS VERTS HAD PLEASED ME VERY MUCH. HE ARRANGED A SHOWING OF HIS LATEST FILM FOR US. IT DESCRIBED THE DAY OF ONE OF THE HEROES OF LES COEURS VERTS LOULOU COMING OUT OF PRISON AFTER FIVE YEARS INSIDE. SARTRE COULD SEE A LITTLE WHEN HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SCREEN AND WHEN HE WAS HELPED BY THE TEXT AND HE LIKED THE FILM VERY MUCH; SO DID I. GAVI AND VICTOR DID NOT THINK IT SUFFICIENTLY POLITICAL BUT THEY WERE NOT AGAINST THE IDEA. ROGER LOUIS SUGGESTED CLAUDE DE GIVRAY AND WHEN WE HAD SEEN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS HE HAD PRODUCED ON TELEVISION WE SAID YES. BOTH OF THEM AGREED TO COLLABORATE WITH US THOUGH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST GUARANTEE ON OUR PART.

AT THE END OF DECEMBER JULLIAN HAD A LITTLE SIX-MINUTE FILM MADE IN SARTRE’S STUDY IN WHICH SARTRE VICTOR GAVI AND I ANNOUNCED OUR PLAN. IT TOOK US THE WHOLE MORNING. WE WERE PLEASED WITH IT WHEN THEY GAVE US A SHOWING A FEW DAYS LATER. IT WAS TO APPEAR ON JANUARY 6 AS PART OF A PROGRAM IN WHICH JULLIAN WOULD POMPOUSLY INTRODUCE HIS PLANS FOR THE YEAR. IT DID NOT APPEAR. A MONTH EARLIER GAVI HAD MADE A BLUNDER THAT NEITHER SARTRE NOR I EVER SUCCEEDED IN UNDERSTANDING: IN LIBÉRATION HE WROTE THAT IF SARTRE AGREED TO WORK FOR TELEVISION IT WAS ONLY SO THAT HE MIGHT MAKE IT APPEAR RIDICULOUS. JULLIAN TOLD SARTRE THAT HE COULD NOT SHOW GAVI ON THE SMALL SCREEN SO SHORT A TIME AFTER THIS ARTICLE. WE ASSERTED OUR SOLIDARITY WITH GAVI SO STRONGLY THAT JULLIAN GAVE UP ON THE IDEA OF CUTTING HIM OUT. IN THE END OUR INTRODUCTION DID APPEAR THOUGH CENSORED ON JANUARY 20.

MEANWHILE ON JANUARY 5 THERE HAD BEEN A MEETING OF THE HISTORIANS MANY OF WHOM CAME UP FROM THE PROVINCES. SINCE SARTRE WAS NOT THERE VICTOR PRESIDED. ON THE SEVENTH WE MET JULLIAN AND WOLFROMM HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN AT LILIANE’S TO CLARIFY CERTAIN POINTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF MONEY. VICTOR AND ANNIE CHÉNIEUX WERE PRODUCTION SECRETARIES AND SO FAR THEY HAD RECEIVED NOTHING; SARTRE HAD TO PAY THEM OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET. HOWEVER WHEN THE FIRST SIX SYNOPSES WERE SENT TO JULLIAN JANUARY 20 HE DID PRODUCE A “LUMP SUM OF 13500 FRANCS” ON THE 22NDAJ THIS BEING AN ADVANCE ON THE TRANSFER PRICE OF WHICH THE GENERAL CONDITIONS WERE STILL TO BE NEGOTIATED. IT HAD NEEDED FIFTEEN TELEPHONE CALLS TO GET THIS MONEY.

APART FROM THE THRICE-WEEKLY MEETINGS OF THE “GANG OF FOUR” AT SARTRE’S APARTMENT MANY OTHERS TOOK PLACE. ON JANUARY 28 SARTRE HAD A TALK WITH LUNTZ AND GIVRAY AND AGAIN ON FEBRUARY 18. ON FEBRUARY 1 THE HISTORIANS GATHERED AND THEREAFTER THEY HAD A PLENARY SESSION ONCE A MONTH IN THE SCOPCOLOR PREMISES. THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL GROUPS THAT WORKED SEPARATELY ON THE VARIOUS THEMES WE HAD PUT FORWARD. DURING THESE ASSEMBLIES THEY SET FORTH THE RESULTS THEY HAD OBTAINED. IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WISHED TO THROW LIGHT ON THE PART PLAYED BY WOMEN IN THE COURSE OF THESE SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS A VERY IMPORTANT PART BUT ONE THAT HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS KEPT SECRET. AS WE KNEW THAT THE GREAT WEALTH OF MATERIAL THAT THE HISTORIANS WERE BRINGING US COULD NOT ALL BE USED WE THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING IT IN BOOKS THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY EACH PROGRAM. IT WAS AGREED WITH PATHÉ THAT THEY WOULD GIVE US ALL THE DOCUMENTS WE REQUIRED FOR NOTHING.

TO DEAL WITH ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WE NEEDED A LAWYER. WE CHOSE KIEJMAN WHOM WE KNEW WELL AND ON FEBRUARY 20 SARTRE AND VICTOR EXPLAINED OUR PROBLEMS TO HIM. AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ADVISED THEM TO ASK THAT A CONTRACT BE SIGNED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ON MARCH 6 SARTRE MET JULLIAN AND WOLFROMM AT LILIANE’S BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING A CONTRACT DRAWN UP; ALL HE MANAGED TO DO WAS EXTRACT ANOTHER CHEQUE FROM THEM THE WHOLE OF WHICH WAS SHARED AMONG THE GROUPS OF HISTORIANS WHOM KIEJMAN HELPED FORM THEMSELVES INTO A SOCIÉTÉ CIVILE A KIND OF COMPANY THAT WAS TO BE REGARDED AS THE FIFTH AUTHOR OF THE PROGRAM.

AS I HAVE SAID SARTRE WAS HAMPERED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PEOPLE HE WAS TALKING TO AND WHEN THERE WERE MANY OF THEM HE DID NOT TAKE MUCH PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS. AT THESE GENERAL ASSEMBLIES IT WAS CHIEFLY VICTOR WHO SPOKE AND HE DID SO WITH AN AUTHORITY THAT INTIMIDATED SOME AND ANGERED OTHERS. YET ON APRIL 13 SARTRE INTERVENED AT LENGTH. THIS WAS A SOMEWHAT STORMY SESSION.

IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT THE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CENTERED ON SARTRE AND THAT IF ANY DISPUTE AROSE HE SHOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. BUT THE HISTORIANS NOW CALLED THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE “GANG OF FOUR” INTO QUESTION AGAIN. THEY DID NOT WISH TO BE LIMITED TO THE MERE GATHERING OF DOCUMENTS FROM WHICH OTHERS WOULD DRAW THEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS. SARTRE TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM THAT SINCE THE AIM WAS AN “AESTHETICOIDEOLOGICAL” WORK IT REQUIRED A SYNTHESIS THAT COULD BE CARRIED OUT ONLY BY A VERY SMALL GROUP. THE HISTORIANS UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT OF VIEW TO SOME EXTENT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY FELT FRUSTRATED. FORTUNATELY THAT DAY SCOPCOLOR HAD PRODUCED A SPLENDID BUFFET LUNCH THAT TOOK THE TENSION OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AS THEY ATE AND DRANK THE MEMBERS WERE ABLE TO TALK IN LITTLE GROUPS OR IN PAIRS. THE AFTERNOON PROCEEDINGS WERE MUCH FRIENDLIER.

YET THE MEETING ON MAY 10 HAD LITTLE LIFE IN IT. AT SCOPCOLOR THE NEXT DAY WE ALL HAD LUNCH TOGETHER AT LITTLE TABLES BUT WE DID NOT RETURN TO THE DISCUSSION. NO ONE WAS FILLED WITH THE SACRED FIRE ANYMORE BECAUSE THE CONTRACT HAD STILL NOT BEEN SIGNED AND WE WERE RATHER DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE WHOLE THING WOULD COME OFF. HOWEVER THE BAND OF WOMEN HISTORIANS DID COME TO SARTRE’S APARTMENT ONE MORNING TO MEET THE “GANG OF FOUR”; THEY WERE MOST COOPERATIVE AND VERY INTERESTING.

THE QUESTION OF MONEY BECAME PRESSING. ON MONDAY MAY 12 WE ALL FOUR MET AT SARTRE’S; JULLIAN WAS ALSO THERE AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER WE EAGERLY TACKLED HIM; IT WAS ONLY TOO OBVIOUS THAT HE LACKED GOOD WILL. THE WHOLE BUSINESS DEPENDED—OR SO IT SEEMED—UPON THE CLASSIFICATION OF OUR WORK. IF IT WAS A DRAMATIC PROGRAM WE WOULD BE ALLOWED THE FUNDS WE NEEDED; IF IT WAS A DOCUMENTARY WE SHOULD ONLY HAVE A RIGHT TO ONE-THIRD OF THAT AMOUNT. JULLIAN WAS TO PERSUADE ALAIN DECAUX THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY OF TELEVISION AUTHORS AND COMPOSERS TO CLASS IT AS DRAMATIC. WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM FOR THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY AND SARTRE DEFINED HIS POSITION IN A LETTER TO JULLIAN.

JEAN-PAUL SARTRE

PARIS 15 MAY 1975
MONSIEUR MARCEL JULLIAN
PRÉSIDENT DE ANTENNE 2
158 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITÉ
PARIS 7E

IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT I SHOULD CREATE A WORK FOR TELEVISION: A WORK THAT IS TO SAY A WHOLE GOVERNED BY ONE SYNTHETIC IDEA AND BROUGHT INTO BEING BY MEANS OF PICTURES DIALOGUES AND COMMENTARIES SPOKEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE ACTED IN THE HISTORY OF THESE LAST SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS (OF WHOM I AM ONE) OR BY ACTORS PLAYING HISTORICAL ROLES.

IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT WE DO NOT CLAIM TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THE FACTS OF THIS HISTORY: WE ARE NOT AIMING AT THE DOCUMENTARY’S KIND OF OBJECTIVITY. WE CHOOSE THAT PART OF THE HISTORICAL MATERIAL THAT SUITS US AND THIS IS HANDLED IN RELATION TO ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECTIVE HISTORY—MINE.

RIGHTLY SPEAKING WE ARE COMPOSING A NARRATIVE AND WE HOPE THAT IT WILL MEAN THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS OWN HISTORY THE VIEWER WILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD. WE MEAN TO GIVE THE WORK AN EPIC CHARACTER MAKING IT A SAGA OF THIS CENTURY AS IT WERE.

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE EMPLOY AESTHETIC MEANS:

—SYMBOLIC METHODS (FOR EXAMPLE A SEQUENCE EVOKING THE THEME OF NAUSEA IN THE THIRD PART);

—LYRICAL PASSAGES (FOR EXAMPLE THE EVOCATION OF SPAIN IN THE THIRD PART);

—RECONSTITUTIONS (FOR EXAMPLE A 1917 COURT MARTIAL IN THE FIRST PART);

—SCENES (SARTRE PLAYING HIS PART ACTORS PLAYING THEIRS);

—DIVERSION OF MATERIAL (FOR EXAMPLE THE DIVERSION OF RUSSIAN DOCUMENTS ON CRONSTADT FROM THEIR PRIMARY DESTINATION IN PART TWO).

THESE INSTANCES OF OUR WAY OF DEALING WITH THE SITUATION ARE GIVEN BY MEANS OF EXAMPLE: THEY ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE.

IN MY OPINION THEREFORE THE WORK CAN ONLY BE LOOKED UPON AS A DRAMATIC TELEVISION PROGRAM AND NOT AT ALL AS A DOCUMENTARY.

DECAUX CAME TO SEE SARTRE ON MAY 22; HE WAS AS AGREEABLE AS COULD BE AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDING. HE CLASSIFIED THE PROGRAM AS DRAMATIC WHICH GAVE HOPES THAT IT WOULD SOON APPEAR. VICTOR TOLD THE HISTORIANS THE GOOD NEWS BY LETTER.

MEANWHILE THE TALKS WITH ANTENNE 2 WENT ON. ON JUNE 11 AT WOLFROMM’S HOUSE THERE WAS A CONFERENCE IN WHICH AT LEAST FOURTEEN PEOPLE TOOK PART INCLUDING JULLIAN EDELINE A MAN REPRESENTING PATHÉ ROGER LOUIS AND PIERRE EMMANUEL THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUT AUDOVISUEL. WE CAME UP AGAINST AN AWKWARD PROBLEM: IF CONTAT’S AND ASTRUC’S FILM SARTRE BY HIMSELF WERE SHOWN ON THE BIG OR THE SMALL SCREEN IT MIGHT WELL PUT ANTENNE 2’S PROGRAMS OUT OF THE RUNNING. THE DIFFICULTY WAS RESOLVED BY MEANS OF A LETTER FROM SELIGMANN THE FILM’S PRODUCER TO JULLIAN UNDERTAKING NOT TO BRING IT OUT BEFORE THE SHOWING OF THE TEN PROGRAMS THAT SARTRE WAS TO PROVIDE FOR ANTENNE 2. THEN AGAIN ON JUNE 18 OUR LAWYER KIEJMAN MET ANTENNE 2’S LAWYER BREDIN AND THEY DRAFTED AN AGREEMENT TO BE SIGNED BY SARTRE AND JULLIAN. THE HISTORIANS AND THOSE CONCERNED WITH PRODUCTION WERE THEREFORE VERY HOPEFUL WHEN THEY ATTENDED THEIR LAST ASSEMBLIES AT THE END OF JUNE. SARTRE WAS LESS SO WHEN HE LEFT PARIS ON JULY 5; ON JUNE 30 HE HAD WRITTEN TO JULLIAN ASKING FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND JULLIAN HAD NOT REPLIED.

ALTHOUGH THIS PLAN KEPT HIM BUSY SARTRE DID MANY OTHER THINGS IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. I CONTINUED TO READ TO HIM GENERALLY SPEAKING BOOKS THAT DEALT WITH THE HISTORY OF THE LAST SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS. HE LISTENED; HE TAPE-RECORDED. HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS UNDIMINISHED AND FOR EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED HIM HIS MEMORY WAS EXCELLENT. BUT HE OFTEN LOST HIS BEARINGS IN TIME AND SPACE AND OFTEN HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE SMALL ROUTINE OF DAILY LIFE THOUGH FORMERLY IT HAD CONCERNED HIM AS MUCH AS IT DID ME.

FOR AN ISSUE OF L’ARC ON “SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR ET LA LUTTE DES FEMMES” I QUESTIONED HIM ON HIS RELATIONS WITH FEMINISM. HE ANSWERED WITH THE GREATEST GOOD WILL BUT RATHER SUPERFICIALLY.

FROM MARCH 23 TO APRIL 16 WE WERE IN PORTUGAL WHERE A YEAR EARLIER ON APRIL 25 1974 THERE HAD BEEN WHAT PEOPLE CALLED “THE CARNATION REVOLUTION.” AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF FASCISM SOME OFFICERS SICKENED BY THE WAR IN ANGOLA AMONG OTHER THINGS HAD RISEN IN REVOLT. BUT IT WAS NOT MERELY A QUESTION OF A MILITARY COUP D’ÉTAT: IT WAS AN ENTIRE NATION THAT HAD AWAKENED AND THAT SUPPORTED THE M.F.A. THE SOLDIERS’ MOVEMENT. SARTRE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MOST UNCOMMON EVENT FROM CLOSER AT HAND. TO BEGIN WITH HE WORRIED: “SHALL I BE ABLE TO SEE LISBON?” BUT HE SOON FORGOT THIS ANXIETY. WE WERE STAYING IN A VERY NOISY HOTEL IN THE CENTER OF THE TOWN CLOSE TO A HUGE OPEN-AIR MARKET. THE WEATHER WAS FINE BUT THERE WAS A VERY STRONG WIND AND WE COULD NOT LINGER ON OUR BROAD BALCONIES. WE WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AMONG THE HAPPY CROWDS AND WE SAT ON THE TERRACES OF THE ROSSIO. AS FAR AS SARTRE WAS CONCERNED IT WAS PRIMARILY A JOURNEY UNDERTAKEN FOR THE SAKE OF INFORMATION. ACCOMPANIED BY PIERRE VICTOR AND SOMETIMES BY SERGE JULY HE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE M.F.A. HE HAD LUNCH IN THE “RED BARRACKS” WHICH OFFICERS ATTEMPTING A PUTSCH HAD TRIED TO STORM NOT LONG BEFORE. HE GAVE A LECTURE TO AN AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS WHO DISAPPOINTED HIM BY THEIR LACK OF REACTION TO HIS QUESTIONS. IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE UNDERGOING THE REVOLUTION RATHER THAN MAKING IT. ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD SOME VERY GOOD ENCOUNTERS WITH THE WORKERS OF A SELF-RUN FACTORY NEAR OPORTO. HE TOOK PART IN A MEETING OF WRITERS WHO IN A CONFUSED PUZZLED MANNER WERE WONDERING ABOUT THE ROLE THAT THEY WOULD NOW HAVE TO PLAY.

WHEN HE CAME BACK SARTRE GAVE A GOOD TALK ON PORTUGAL OVER THE RADIO AND FROM APRIL 22 TO 26 LIBÉRATION CARRIED A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SARTRE VICTOR GAVI AND ME EDITED BY JULY: (1) REVOLUTION AND SOLDIERS; (2) WOMEN AND STUDENTS; (3) THE PEOPLE AND SELF-MANAGEMENT; (4) CONTRADICTIONS; AND (5) THE THREE POWERS. SARTRE ENDED BY EXPRESSING HIS CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE M.F.A.

IN MAY THE CZECH PHILOSOPHER KAREL KOSIK SENT HIM AN OPEN LETTER DENOUNCING THE REPRESSION CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE INTELLECTUALS OF HIS COUNTRY. HE SPOKE OF THE PERSECUTIONS THAT HE PERSONALLY HAD SUFFERED INCLUDING THE CONFISCATION OF HIS MANUSCRIPTS. SARTRE ASSURED HIM OF HIS SUPPORT IN ANOTHER OPEN LETTER. “PSEUDO-THOUGHT IS WHAT I CALL THE THESES MAINTAINED BY YOUR GOVERNMENT” HE WROTE “THESES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN PRODUCED OR EXAMINED BY THE THINKING MIND OF A FREE MAN BUT WHICH ARE MADE UP OF WORDS PICKED UP IN SOVIET RUSSIA AND APPLIED TO ACTIVITIES TO HIDE THEM NOT TO DISCOVER THEIR MEANING.” HE ALSO PUBLISHED IN LE MONDE OF MAY 10 A STATEMENT ON THE PAST ACTIVITY OF THE RUSSELL TRIBUNAL. HE HAD BEEN ASKED FOR THIS IN CONNECTION WITH THE END OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM. HE GAVE TITO GERASSI AN INTERVIEW THAT APPEARED IN A CHICAGO MAGAZINE. AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID “EVERY ONE OF MY OPTIONS HAS ENLARGED MY WORLD. SO THAT I NO LONGER SEE THEIR IMPLICATIONS AS BEING LIMITED TO FRANCE. THE STRUGGLES I IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH ARE WORLDWIDE STRUGGLES.” HE SIGNED SEVERAL DOCUMENTS DURING THIS YEAR: AN APPEAL FOR THE PARIS AGREEMENT ON VIETNAM TO BE RESPECTED (LE MONDE JANUARY 26–27); A WARNING AGAINST JEAN-EDERN HALLIER WHO WAS ACCUSED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY OF HAVING EMBEZZLED MONEY INTENDED FOR THE DEFENSE OF CHILEAN PRISONERS; AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF THE BASQUE NATIONALISTS (LE MONDE JUNE 17 1975).

WE STILL HAD VERY PLEASANT EVENINGS WITH SYLVIE. ONE DAY WE DINED WITH MAHEU AT HIS HOUSE; FOR SOME YEARS NOW WE HAD RESUMED OUR RELATIONS WITH HIM—REGULAR AGREEABLE MEETINGS THOUGH INFREQUENT. WE LIKED NADINE HIS COMPANION AND FRANÇOIS THEIR SON. SHE TURNED THESE DINNERS INTO POSITIVE CELEBRATIONS. BUT AT THAT TIME MAHEU WAS SERIOUSLY ILL WITH A KIND OF LEUKEMIA AND HE KNEW THAT DEATH WAS LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM. WE ONCE SAW HIM AT THE CLINIC WHERE HE HAD BEEN TAKEN AFTER A VERY BAD ATTACK; HE WAS WEARING A MAGNIFICENT DRESSING GOWN AND HE WAS NOTHING BUT SKIN AND BONE. ON THAT PARTICULAR EVENING IN HIS BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT DECORATED WITH PRECIOUS THINGS BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS TRAVELS WE THOUGHT HE LOOKED EVEN THINNER AND VERY MUCH OLDER. BY CONTRAST I WAS STRUCK WITH THE YOUTHFULNESS OF SARTRE WHO HAD GROWN SLIM AND ALERT ONCE MORE. THIS WAS THE LAST TIME WE EVER SAW MAHEU; HE DIED SHORTLY AFTERWARD.

THAT JUNE SARTRE FELT FULL OF LIFE. STUDENTS CAME TO SEE HIM SOME BRINGING ESSAYS THESES AND BOOKS DEVOTED TO HIM. THE PAPERS SPOKE OF HIM OFTEN. “IT SEEMS THAT I’M GROWING FAMOUS AGAIN” HE SAID TO ME CHEERFULLY. IN MARCH CONTAT HAD STAYED WITH HIM AT JUNAS FOR THREE DAYS AND SARTRE HAD GIVEN HIM A LONG AND MOVING INTERVIEW THAT LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR PUBLISHED IN PART ON THE OCCASION OF HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY AND THAT BROUGHT HIM CORDIAL CONGRATULATIONS—TELEPHONE CALLS TELEGRAMS LETTERS. IN THIS CONVERSATIONAK WHICH WAS ENTITLED “SARTRE PAR LUI-MÊME” SARTRE REVIEWED HIS WHOLE LIFE ON ALMOST ALL LEVELS AND HE DESCRIBED HIS PRESENT AMBIGUOUS FEELING WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD. “HOW ARE THINGS?” CONTAT ASKED HIM. AND SARTRE “I CAN’T SAY THEY’RE GOING WELL. BUT I CAN’T SAY THEY’RE GOING BADLY EITHER.… MY CALLING AS A WRITER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED.… IN ONE SENSE THAT TAKES ALL REASON FOR EXISTENCE AWAY FROM ME. I HAVE BEEN AND I AM NO MORE YOU MIGHT SAY. I OUGHT TO FEEL VERY DEJECTED YET FOR SOME REASON THAT I DON’T UNDERSTAND I FEEL PRETTY WELL. I’M NEVER SAD—I HAVE NO MELANCHOLY MOMENTS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I’VE LOST.… THAT’S JUST HOW THINGS ARE AND THERE’S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT SO I HAVE NO CALL TO BE WRETCHED. I HAVE HAD SOME DISAGREEABLE MOMENTS.… NOW ALL I CAN DO IS PUT UP WITH MYSELF AS I AM. WHAT IS FORBIDDEN TO ME FROM NOW ON IS … STYLE; OR LET’S SAY THE LITERARY FASHION OF SETTING OUT AN IDEA OR A REALITY.”

FURTHER ON HE SPOKE OF HIS RELATIONS WITH DEATH. “NOT THAT I THINK ABOUT IT—I NEVER THINK ABOUT IT; BUT I KNOW IT’S GOING TO COME.” HE THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT COME FOR TEN YEARS. ONE DAY HAVING MADE SOME ABSTRUSE CALCULATIONS BASED ON THE LONGEVITY OF HIS FOREBEARS HE SAID HE RECKONED UPON LIVING TO EIGHTY-ONE. SPEAKING TO CONTAT HE AGAIN SAID THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS LIFE. “ALL RIGHT. I’VE DONE WHAT I HAD TO DO.… I’VE WRITTEN I’VE LIVED; THERE’S NOTHING TO REGRET.” HE ALSO SAID TO HIM “I DON’T HAVE THE FEELING OF OLD AGE.” HE SAID HE WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO THINGS BUT HE DID ADMIT THAT “THERE ARE NOT MANY THINGS LEFT THAT EXCITE ME. I SET MYSELF ON A RATHER HIGHER PLANE.” THE INTERVIEW AS A WHOLE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS PAST TO ACCEPT THE PRESENT SERENELY.

LILIANE SIEGEL GAVE A PARTY IN HIS HONOR ON JUNE 21. AMONG OTHERS THERE WERE VICTOR GAVI GEISMAR GEORGES MICHEL AND MYSELF. WE WERE ALL VERY GAY AND SARTRE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER. ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 25 TOGETHER WITH MANY FRIENDS WE SAW A PRIVATE SCREENING OF THE FILM SARTRE BY HIMSELF. AND ONCE AGAIN AS HE SAT THERE NEXT TO ME HE SEEMED IN SPITE OF HIS ALMOST TOTAL LOSS OF SIGHT THE SAME AS HE WAS ON THE SCREEN.

WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR OUR VACATION. THIS YEAR WE WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING NEW—WE WERE ABANDONING ITALY FOR GREECE AN IDEA THAT PLEASED SARTRE VERY MUCH. THE CONTRACT WITH JULLIAN HAD NOT BEEN SIGNED WHICH VEXED US BUT WE WERE HOPEFUL; AND WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE WORK WE AND OUR COLLABORATORS HAD DONE IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. WITH VICTOR SARTRE HAD ROUGHED OUT A BOOK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE CALLED POUVOIR ET LIBERTÉ (POWER AND FREEDOM) AND THAT HE INTENDED TO THINK ABOUT DURING THE SUMMER.

FIRST HE STAYED WITH ARLETTE THEN WITH WANDA IN ROME; AND IN AUGUST SYLVIE AND I WHO HAD BEEN TRAVELING IN GREECE WENT TO MEET HIM AT THE ATHENS AIRPORT. HE SEEMED TO BE IN EXCELLENT FORM. HE WAS NOT WALKING VERY WELL BUT EVEN SO DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS HE WAS ABLE TO GO DOWN THE HILL OF THE MUSES ON FOOT AND STROLL ABOUT THE LITTLE STREETS THEY CALL THE FLEA FAIR. HE SAW HIS GREEK FRIEND AGAIN. SHE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY CURED AND SHE NOW WORKED AS AN ASSISTANT AT THE UNIVERSITY. BECAUSE OF THE MEDICINES SHE TOOK SHE HAD GAINED OVER TWENTY POUNDS; FURTHERMORE SHE WAS AS SILENT NOW AS SHE HAD BEEN TALKATIVE BEFORE HER ILLNESS. BUT SHE WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL AND SARTRE LIKED BEING WITH HER. WHEN THEY WERE OUT TOGETHER I WALKED ABOUT ATHENS WITH SYLVIE.

ALMOST AT ONCE WE SET OFF FOR CRETE BY SHIP TAKING THE CAR WITH US. I HAD BOOKED COMFORTABLE CABINS AND WE HAD A FINE SMOOTH CROSSING. IT WAS POETIC FINDING OURSELVES ON AN UNKNOWN ROAD BY THE SIDE OF THE SEA AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING WITH THE SUN COMING UP. THE ELOUNDA BEACH HOTEL SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE PARADISE WITH ITS WHITEWASHED COTTAGES SCATTERED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE WATER OR SET A LITTLE BACK AMONG SCENTED PLANTS AND BRILLIANTLY COLORED FLOWERS. THE ONE SYLVIE AND I SHARED WAS RIGHT ON THE SEA; SARTRE’S WAS SOME TWENTY YARDS INLAND. INSIDE THEY WERE COMFORTABLE AND VERY PLEASANT COOLED BY AIR CONDITIONING. ON MOST DAYS SYLVIE BATHED IN THE MORNING WHILE SARTRE AND I LISTENED TO MUSIC—WE HAD BROUGHT A TAPE RECORDER AND CASSETTES WITH US—OR WE READ. AMONG OTHER THINGS I REMEMBER A FAT BOOK ON THOREZ AND PRESIDENT SCHREBER’S LES MÉMOIRES D’UN NÉVROPATHE. WE LUNCHED IN AN OPEN-AIR DINING ROOM SHELTERED FROM THE SUN; PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES AS THEY PLEASED FROM A SUMPTUOUS HOT AND COLD BUFFET. WE MADE A FEW EXCURSIONS BY CAR—A VERY BEAUTIFUL ONE TOOK US TO THE EASTERN TIP OF THE ISLAND; ANOTHER TO HERAKLION AND KNOSSOS; ANOTHER RATHER LONG AND TIRING AS FAR AS CANEA. IN THE AFTERNOON WE USUALLY STAYED AT HOME WITH OUR BOOKS AND CASSETTES. THERE WAS NO AGREEABLE BAR BUT WE HAD REFRIGERATORS AND IN THE EVENING SYLVIE MADE US DELICIOUS WHISKEY SOURS.AL WE HAD DINNER IN OUR ROOMS EATING ALMOST NOTHING OR OCCASIONALLY IN A PLEASANT RUSTIC TAVERN NEXT TO THE HOTEL. SARTRE WAS PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING; HE WAS WONDERFULLY WELL AND NEVER SO MUCH AS A CLOUD CAME OVER HIS CHEERFULNESS.

AFTER ABOUT TWELVE DAYS WE WENT BACK TO ATHENS. THE RETURN VOYAGE WAS WEARISOME; WE HAD BOOKED TWO CABINS BUT THEY REFUSED TO GIVE US THE KEYS. AMID HELLISH NOISE HEAT AND CROWDS SYLVIE AND I FOUGHT TO GET THEM AT THE RECEPTION DESK BUT IN VAIN. IN THE END THEY SHOVED ALL THREE OF US INTO A FAR FROM COMFORTABLE CABIN WITH FOUR BUNKS. WE WERE ASLEEP WHEN LATE AT NIGHT AN OFFICER OPENED THE DOOR: “YOU ARE M. SARTRE; WE DIDN’T KNOW. YOUR CABINS ARE WAITING FOR YOU.” WE REFUSED TO STIR.

WITH JOY WE SOAKED OURSELVES IN THE CALM OF OUR ATHENIAN HOTEL ONCE MORE. WE LUNCHED AT ABOUT TWO ON A TOASTED SANDWICH AND A COCKTAIL IN A BAR ICY WITH AIR CONDITIONING. THEN AFTER GOING OUT ON FOOT OR BY CAR WE OFTEN HAD ANOTHER COCKTAIL ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF THE HILTON WHICH GAVE A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE CITY AND THE DISTANT SEA. WE DINED HERE OR THERE OFTEN IN AN OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT AT THE FOOT OF THE ACROPOLIS.

ON AUGUST 28 I DROVE SYLVIE TO THE SHIP THAT WAS TO TAKE HER BACK TO MARSEILLES. FROM THERE SHE WOULD GO BACK TO PARIS BY CAR. TWO DAYS LATER SARTRE AND I TOOK A PLANE FOR RHODES. A MERE HOP. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES WHEN WE BEGAN TO COME DOWN AGAIN. WE HAD TWO ROOMS WITH BROAD BALCONIES NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER ON THE SIXTH FLOOR OF A HOTEL ON THE EDGE OF THE SEA ABOUT A MILE FROM THE OLD TOWN. THE BAR AND THE RESTAURANT WHERE WE LUNCHED EVERY DAY WERE ON A TERRACE OPENING ONTO THE SEA. AS EVENING FELL A TAXI WOULD TAKE US TO THE GATES OF ANCIENT RHODES. WE WALKED ABOUT THE OLD STREETS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO FULL OF LIFE. THE JOY OF DISCOVERING NEW PLACES WITH SARTRE WAS ONE THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN. WE WOULD STOP IN A LITTLE OPEN-AIR CAFÉ SHADED BY AN ENORMOUS TREE OF THE KIND ONE FINDS IN GREEK VILLAGES. SOMETIMES WE ATE A SNACK IN A PLEASANT RESTAURANT AT THE FOOT OF THE WALLS. A TAXI WOULD TAKE US BACK AND FOR AN HOUR OR TWO I WOULD READ ALOUD TO SARTRE ON MY BALCONY. THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SEA DAZZLING; THE VAST BEACH AT OUR FEET REMINDED ME A LITTLE OF COPACABANA.

WE MADE TWO EXCURSIONS BOTH BY TAXI. THE ONE TO LINDOS A LITTLE VILLAGE WITH WHITEWASHED STREETS BEAUTIFULLY POISED ABOVE THE SEA. THE PLACE IS PARTICULARLY FAMOUS FOR ITS ACROPOLIS BUT ONE HAD TO RIDE ASSES TO GET UP TO IT AND WE DID NOT POSSESS THE ENERGY. THE OTHER EXPEDITION WAS TO KAMIROS A LARGE AND FAIRLY WELL-PRESERVED ANCIENT TOWN. ON THE WAY WE SAW A VERY BEAUTIFUL MONASTERY BUILT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

WE RETURNED TO ATHENS AND STAYED THERE ANOTHER TEN DAYS. THE WEATHER WAS ALMOST COOL AND WALKING WAS A PLEASURE. SARTRE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DOING SO; HE EVEN CLIMBED UP TO THE ACROPOLIS. SOMETIMES HE HAD DINNER WITH MELINA WHO NEVER HAD ANY SPARE TIME DURING THE DAY. SHE WOULD TAKE HIM TO A CAFÉ WHERE THE ATHENIAN INTELLECTUALS GATHERED. WHEN HE CAME BACK ABOUT ELEVEN HE WOULD HAVE A GLASS OF WHISKEY IN MY ROOM.

DURING THIS STAY HE GAVE TWO INTERVIEWS ONE TO A LEFT-WING DAILY AND THE OTHER TO AN ANARCHIST BULLETIN.

AT ONE POINT IN THE COURSE OF THIS SUMMER JULLIAN SENT SARTRE A LETTER IN WHICH HE SUGGESTED PUTTING ON A “PILOT-PROGRAM” WHICH WAS INSULTING AND ABSURD SINCE THE SERIES FORMED A WHOLE WHICH COULD NOT BE JUDGED BY A SINGLE FRAGMENT. ON SEPTEMBER 23 A FEW DAYS AFTER HAVING RETURNED TO PARIS SARTRE VICTOR AND I—GAVI WAS IN THE STATES—MET JULLIAN AT LILIANE SIEGEL’S APARTMENT. SARTRE ATTACKED HIM VIGOROUSLY. HE WAS NO LONGER OF AN AGE TO SIT FOR EXAMINATIONS HE SAID. BUT THIS SUGGESTED PILOT-PROGRAM WAS IN FACT AN EXAMINATION ONE THAT WOULD BE MARKED POOR AVERAGE OR GOOD. THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE JUDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PUBLIC; YET IT WAS NOT TO THE PUBLIC THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS TO BE SUBMITTED BUT TO “SPECIALISTS.” THE QUESTION OF MONEY THAT JULLIAN WAS TRYING TO BRING FORWARD WAS NOT THE REAL QUESTION AT ALL SINCE A BUDGET OF A MILLION FRANCS WAS USUAL FOR A DRAMATIC PROGRAM LASTING AN HOUR AND A HALF: MANY EXAMPLES COULD BE CITED. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE SYNOPSES HAD BEEN LAID ON THE DESK OF CHIRAC THE PRIME MINISTER BY ANDRÉ VIVIEN A DEPUTY CHARGED WITH RELATIONS WITH THE O.R.T.F. WHO HAD BEEN SHOWN THEM BY JULLIAN. SINCE JANUARY VIVIEN AND CHIRAC HAD BEEN RADICALLY OPPOSED TO OUR PROJECT AND JULLIAN RESPECTFUL OF THEIR AUTHORITY HAD MERELY BEEN STRINGING US ALONG. BY THE TIME EVERYBODY LEFT THE BREAK WAS COMPLETE.

ON SEPTEMBER 25 SARTRE ACCOMPANIED BY VICTOR AND ME HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE COUR DES MIRACLES. AS SOON AS JULLIAN WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS ON SEPTEMBER 24 HE TELEPHONED SARTRE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD AGREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OLD FRANCS.AM SIX MONTHS EARLIER THERE WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN TIME ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE SCENARIOS SO AS TO DIMINISH THEIR COST;AN NOW IT WAS TOO LATE AND JULLIAN KNEW IT. HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE WHOLE THING FROM BEING MADE PUBLIC. IT WAS MADE PUBLIC. THERE WERE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE AT THE COUR DES MIRACLES. SARTRE WAS IN GREAT FORM AND HE RECOUNTED THE WHOLE STORY TELLING THE EXACT TRUTH AND SPEAKING IN A WHOLLY CONVINCING MANNER. HE HAD SUBTITLED THE PRESS CONFERENCE “A PROBLEM OF TELEVISION CENSORSHIP.” HE OBSERVED “IT HAS BEEN SAID ‘SARTRE IS GIVING UP.’ NO. I HAVE BEEN MADE TO GIVE UP. IT IS A CASE OF CATEGORICAL INDIRECT CENSORSHIP.” HE STATED THAT JULLIAN HAD PROMISED HIM COMPLETE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. WHEN WE PUT THE FIRST ESTIMATES TO HIM HE HAD SAID “EVEN IF IT GOES BEYOND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION [OLD FRANCS] WE’LL STILL DO IT.” THEN HE HAD HAD AN ALTERCATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON THE SUBJECT OUR SYNOPSES HAVING INEXPLICABLY FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF CHIRAC WHO REFUSED THEM. THEN JULLIAN TRIED TO WIN BY WEARING US DOWN AND IN THE END HE TOOK REFUGE IN THE UNACCEPTABLE SUGGESTION OF A PILOT PROGRAM. THE JOURNALISTS LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND AT THE END SOME OF THEM ASKED “WHY DON’T YOU WORK FOR FOREIGN TELEVISION?” SARTRE REPLIED “THIS IS THE HISTORY OF THE FRENCH AND IT’S FRENCH PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO TALK TO.” TO ANOTHER QUESTION “WHY NOT USE THE FILM DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS?” HE SAID “TEN HOURS IS A LONG TIME. BESIDES THIS PROGRAM WAS TO BE A DYNAMIC APPROACH ON TELEVISION FOR THE FIRST TIME. I SUSPECTED THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO WORK WITH THIS PARTICULAR TELEVISION NETWORK. MARCEL JULLIAN HAD SHAKEN MY CONVICTION. BUT NOW IT’S OVER. I WON’T APPEAR ON TELEVISION AGAIN EITHER IN FRANCE OR ELSEWHERE.” LATER HE REMARKED “FOR HIS PART MICHEL DROIT HAD ALL POSSIBLE FREEDOM FOR HIS 1946 TO 1970 CHRONICLES.”

ON THE WHOLE THE PAPERS GAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THIS CONFERENCE AND JULLIAN BEGAN A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST SARTRE. AT FIRST HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED “M. SARTRE IS NOT A MONEY-GRUBBER BUT HE WANTED TO HAVE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS AT HIS DISPOSAL TO BRING HIS DREAM INTO EXISTENCE.” IN SPITE OF THIS HE LATER INSINUATED THAT SARTRE WANTED TO EARN ENORMOUS ROYALTIES WHICH WAS UNTRUE SINCE THESE ROYALTIES WERE TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY SHARED AMONG THE MANY GROUPS OF HISTORIANS. HE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT SARTRE LEFT THE UNDERTAKING TO HIS YOUNG COLLABORATORS. THIS WAS EQUALLY FALSE FOR SARTRE WORKED VERY HARD WITHIN THE “GANG OF FOUR” AND WAS PRESENT AT ALL THE GENERAL MEETINGS. LASTLY THE TELEVISION PEOPLE PUT OUT A RUMOR THAT ECHOED AS FAR AS STOCKHOLM WHENCE A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO THE FRANCE-PRESSE AGENCY. ACCORDING TO THIS RUMOR SARTRE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ASKED FOR THE MONEY FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE WHICH HE HAD REFUSED IN 1964. HE SENT THE PAPERS A VERY STRONG DENIAL.

R.T.L.AO SUGGESTED THAT SARTRE SHOULD BE INTERVIEWED ON THE JOURNAL INATTENDU WITH VICTOR AND ME ON OCTOBER 5 1975. HE AGREED AND WE PREPARED OUR PIECES. BUT THIS WHOLE BUSINESS IRRITATED HIM. IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK ARLETTE TOLD ME ON THE TELEPHONE THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY WEARY AND ONE EVENING WHILE WITH ME HE FOUND IT REALLY HARD TO SPEAK; THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE WERE ALMOST PARALYZED. IT WAS OVER IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BUT HE TOLD ME THAT IT OFTEN HAPPENED TO HIM AND I REMAINED UNEASY.

HE HAD NO LIFE IN HIM WHEN WE WENT TO THE R.T.L. STUDIO AND HE STUMBLED GOING UPSTAIRS. THE JOURNALIST WHO RECEIVED US WAS OBVIOUSLY HOSTILE AND I FELT TENSE. SARTRE SEEMED HARASSED; HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH SCARCELY ANY VARIATION OF TONE. I WAS HORRIBLY AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A FIT OF ABSTRACTION DURING THE PROGRAM. IN THIS EMERGENCY I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO SPEAK A GOOD DEAL EVEN INTERRUPTING THE R.T.L. MAN TO MAKE OUR DEALINGS WITH JULLIAN QUITE CLEAR. AND COHN-BENDIT TAKING PART BY RELAY FROM SWITZERLAND SPOKE IN A SHARP AND DECISIVE MANNER. SO ON THE WHOLE THIS “JOURNAL INATTENDU” WAS A SUCCESS.

FROM THE STUDIO WE WENT TO LILIANE SIEGEL’S APARTMENT WHERE SHE HAD PREPARED A LITTLE BUFFET LUNCHEON. HERE WE MET A FEW OF THE HISTORIANS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED OVER THE BREAK WITH ANTENNE 2. TOWARD FIVE I TOOK SARTRE BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE AND THERE HE SLEPT FOR A WHILE. HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS TIRED OUT. “THAT MAKES MORE THAN FIVE HOURS WE’VE BEEN WORKING” HE SAID IN AN EXHAUSTED VOICE. HE SPENT THE EVENING AT WANDA’S AND THE NEXT MORNING ON SUNDAY OCTOBER 5 ARLETTE CALLED ME. “IT WASN’T VERY SERIOUS” SHE SAID “BUT EVEN SO …” SARTRE HAD MORE OR LESS FALLEN WHEN HE WAS AT WANDA’S. SHE HAD PUT HIM INTO A TAXI; MICHÈLE WAS WAITING OUTSIDE THE DÔME TO TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS APARTMENT. ONCE THERE HE HAD AGAIN LOST HIS BALANCE AND THIS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES. SHE HAD DRIVEN HIM TO ARLETTE’S IN THE MORNING AND AGAIN HE HAD FALLEN. ON BEING CALLED IN ZAIDMANN HAD GIVEN SARTRE INJECTIONS AND PRESCRIBED A LONG REST IN BED. I SPOKE TO SARTRE ON THE TELEPHONE; HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR BUT WEARY. HE STAYED TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ARLETTE WHO TOOK HIM HOME IN A FRIEND’S CAR. THEY ALMOST CARRIED HIM UP TO HIS OWN APARTMENT AND THERE THEY PUT HIM TO BED. I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HIM AND ZAIDMANN CAME IN THE EVENING. SARTRE’S BLOOD PRESSURE HAD RISEN FROM 140 TO 200. HE HAD TO BE SUPPORTED WHEN HE TOOK THE FEW STEPS FROM HIS ROOM TO THE LAVATORY. I SLEPT IN THE OTHER BEDROOM WITH ALL DOORS OPEN.

HE STAYED IN BED ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. ON TUESDAY EVENING DR. LAPRESLE CAME WITH ZAIDMANN. SARTRE’S BLOOD-PRESSURE WAS 215. THEY HAD A LONG CONFERENCE. IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL MEDICINES THEY PRESCRIBED A POWERFUL TENSION REDUCER AND VALIUM TO HELP HIM SMOKE LESS. THEY ADVISED HIM TO GET UP AND SIT IN AN ARMCHAIR BUT TO HAVE A NAP IN THE AFTERNOONS.

LIFE TOOK ON A PATTERN. SARTRE ATE HIS MEALS AT HOME. ON SUNDAYS SYLVIE TOOK HIM HIS LUNCH ON THURSDAYS LILIANE ON MONDAYS AND FRIDAYS MICHÈLE AND ARLETTE THE OTHER DAYS. AS FOR DINNER I BOUGHT LITTLE THINGS ON THOSE DAYS WHEN I STAYED WITH HIM.

ZAIDMANN CAME AGAIN ON THE MORNING OF WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 15. THE BLOOD PRESSURE HAD FALLEN TO 160. HE REDUCED THE MEDICATIONS AND TOLD SARTRE TO GO OUT A LITTLE WHICH HE DID. HE LOOKED ALMOST AS WELL AS HE HAD BEFORE HIS ATTACK BUT THE MEDICINES HE HAD TO TAKE BROUGHT ON HIS URINARY INCONTINENCE AGAIN AND SOMETIMES HE EVEN FOULED HIS PYJAMAS AT NIGHT. HE LOOKED UPON THESE ACCIDENTS WITH AN INDIFFERENCE THAT I FOUND HARD TO BEAR.

IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HE SAID WITH AN OBSTINATE LOOK THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO SMOKING. I PROTESTED STRONGLY. IF HE BECAME SENILE IT WOULD BE I WHO SUFFERED FROM IT—HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. DID I PERSUADE HIM? OR WAS HE AFFECTED BY AN ARTICLE MICHÈLE READ TO HIM SAYING THAT IN CASES OF ARTERITIS SMOKING MIGHT LEAD TO THE AMPUTATION OF A LEG? HE ALMOST STOPPED. HE SMOKED NO MORE THAN FOUR CIGARETTES A DAY AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD FORGET THE FOURTH.

THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE SEEMED TO FIND HIS SITUATION PAINFUL. ONE EVENING WE AGREED THAT ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO LIVE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. “IN ANY CASE” HE OBSERVED “I’M NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT ONE OF THE EXTRAS.” WHEN I REMINDED HIM OF THE REMARK THE NEXT DAY HE TOLD ME WHY HE HAD MADE IT. HE HAD BEEN IRRITATED BECAUSE GAVI HAD DRAGGED AN INTERVIEW ON SPAIN OUT OF HIM FOR LIBÉRATION.

THIS INTERVIEW APPEARED ON OCTOBER 28 1975 WHILE FRANCO WAS ON HIS DEATHBED. SARTRE SPOKE OF HIS HAVING “A LATIN BRUTE’S ABOMINABLE FACE.” THE EXPRESSION HAD MADE MANY READERS INDIGNANT. SARTRE SAID “IT WAS A MISTAKE—WORDS UTTERED IN THE HEAT OF CONVERSATION ACQUIRE ANOTHER MEANING WHEN THEY ARE LITERALLY TRANSCRIBED—BUT IT IS A MISTAKE I TAKE UPON MYSELF ENTIRELY. FRANCO HAD THE FACE HE DESERVED; WITHOUT ANY KIND OF DOUBT HE WAS A BRUTE AND NO ONE WILL DENY THAT HE WAS A LATIN.”

HIS HEALTH WAS NOT IMPROVING AND HE REALIZED IT. “PHYSICALLY I AM NOT VERY WELL” HE SAID TO LILIANE ONE MORNING AS HE WAS HAVING BREAKFAST WITH HER IN A NEIGHBORING CAFÉ THE LIBERTÉ. HE COMPLAINED THAT IN THE MORNING HIS MOUTH AND ABOVE ALL HIS THROAT WERE HALF PARALYZED WHICH EXPLAINED WHY IT WAS SO HARD FOR HIM TO SWALLOW. IT TOOK HIM AT LEAST AN HOUR TO GET THROUGH A CUP OF TEA OR A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE. HIS SUGAR LEVEL WAS WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE BUT HIS WALKING GREW WORSE AND WORSE. ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER 19 HE HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE LIBERTÉ A HUNDRED YARDS FROM HIS BUILDING AND THEN AT ABOUT TWO IN GOING TO THE BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT AT THE FOOT OF THE TOUR MONTPARNASSE WHERE WE OFTEN HAD LUNCH. ZAIDMANN SAW HIM THE NEXT DAY AND HE FOUND THIS REGRESSION DISTURBING. DR. LAPRESLE CAME LATE IN THE AFTERNOON; HE THOUGHT SARTRE BETTER THAN THE LAST TIME HE HAD SEEN HIM AND EVEN ON THE WHOLE IN GOOD HEALTH. BUT AS FAR AS HIS MOTOR ACTIVITIES (WALKING SWALLOWING) WERE CONCERNED HE TOLD ME THAT “SARTRE HAD MOVED DOWN TO A LEVEL FROM WHICH HE WOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN.” I REMEMBERED HIM TWO MONTHS EARLIER CLIMBING THE ACROPOLIS; AND I WONDERED WHETHER THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN HE COULD NO LONGER MOVE AT ALL. AND THEN AS HE WAS IN POOR CONTROL OF HIS REFLEXES THERE WAS ANOTHER ACCIDENT WITH HIS BOWELS. IT IS HORRIBLE YOUR BODY BETRAYING YOU WHILE YOUR MIND IS STILL SOUND.

FOR INTELLECTUALLY SARTRE HAD RECOVERED ENTIRELY. “THE GREAT THING IS TO WORK” HE SAID “AND FORTUNATELY MY HEAD’S ALL RIGHT.” HE ALSO SAID TO ME “I’M MORE INTELLIGENT THAN I HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG WHILE.” THAT WAS TRUE. HE WORKED STEADILY WITH VICTOR ON THEIR PLANNED BOOK POUVOIR ET LIBERTÉ (POWER AND FREEDOM); HE TOOK A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE WORKS I READ HIM AND IN EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WORLD PARTICULARLY THE GOLDMAN CASEAP WHICH HE KNEW IN ITS SMALLEST DETAILS. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT GOLDMAN’S APPEAL WOULD BE REJECTED SARTRE WITH VICTOR’S HELP DREW UP A LETTER OF PROTEST FOR LE MONDE. HE DID NOT PUBLISH IT BECAUSE THE JUDGMENT CONDEMNING GOLDMAN WAS QUASHED TO THE GREAT JOY OF ALL HIS FRIENDS.

THANKS TO ALL HIS ACTIVITIES SARTRE WAS ONCE MORE HAPPY TO BE ALIVE. ONE MORNING LILIANE ASKED HIM “IT DOESN’T BOTHER YOU MUCH BEING DEPENDENT ON OTHERS?” HE SMILED. “NO. THERE’S EVEN SOMETHING RATHER AGREEABLE ABOUT IT.” “BEING CODDLED?” “YES.” “BECAUSE YOU FEEL WE LOVE YOU?” “OH I KNEW THAT ALREADY. BUT IT’S PLEASANT.” ON NOVEMBER 10 THE EUROPEAN EDITION OF NEWSWEEK PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW SARTRE HAD GIVEN JANE FRIEDMAN. SHE ASKED HIM “WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR LIFE AT PRESENT?” HE REPLIED “I DON’T KNOW. EVERYTHING. LIVING. SMOKING.” HE WAS FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE BEAUTY OF THIS BLUE AND GOLDEN FALL AND HE REJOICED IN IT.

SARTRE WAS OFTEN ASKED TO SIGN MANIFESTOES AND APPEALS AND HE USUALLY AGREED. TOGETHER WITH MALRAUX MENDÈS FRANCE ARAGON AND FRANCOIS JACOB HE SIGNED AN APPEAL TO PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF ELEVEN MEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH IN SPAIN.† WHEN THEY WERE EXECUTED HE SIGNED A PROTEST AND AN APPEAL FOR A MARCH ON SPAIN. WITH MITTERAND MENDÈS FRANCE AND MALRAUX HE PROTESTED AGAINST THE UNITED NATIONS’ RESOLUTION LIKENING ZIONISM TO RACISM (IN LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR OF NOVEMBER 17). HE SIGNED AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF IMPRISONED SOLDIERS WHICH WAS READ AT THE MUTUALITÉ ON DECEMBER 15.

HE HAD A NEW DISTRACTION. ARLETTE HAD RENTED A TELEVISION SET FOR HIM AND WHEN THERE WAS A GOOD WESTERN OR AN ENTERTAINING FILM OF ANY KIND WE WATCHED IT. BY SITTING VERY CLOSE TO THE SCREEN SARTRE COULD MAKE OUT THE PICTURE PRETTY WELL. ONE MONDAY MORNING I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE AN EXCELLENT GREEK FILM LE VOYAGE DES COMÉDIENS. THE MANAGER HAD PUT THE THEATER AT OUR DISPOSAL; ONLY A FEW FRIENDS WERE THERE SO I COULD READ SARTRE THE SUBTITLES WITHOUT BOTHERING ANYONE.

ON DECEMBER 1 SARTRE RECEIVED A THREATENING LETTER SIGNED G.I.N.… GISÈLE HALIMI ASSERTED THAT IT WAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE G.I.N. BEING AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING GROUP THAT BOASTED OF HAVING BLOWN UP PHOTO-LIBÉRATION. SHE WARNED THE NEIGHBORING POLICE STATION AND I HAD AN ARMORED DOOR INSTALLED. I WAS REALLY UNEASY BUT SARTRE TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF IT. HIS SERENITY NEVER FAILED. “I’VE HAD AN EXCELLENT THREE MONTHS” HE TOLD ME LOOKING RADIANT AT THE END OF DECEMBER. AND WHEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HE WAS ASKED WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD WISH HIM HE REPLIED EAGERLY “A LONG LIFE.”

TOGETHER WITH SYLVIE WE MADE A BRIEF JOURNEY TO GENEVA WHICH THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINED SARTRE IN SPITE OF THE SNOW AND THE COLD. WE WALKED ABOUT THE OLD TOWN; WE SAW COPPET AND VISITED LAUSANNE. BACK IN PARIS SARTRE RETURNED TO HIS WORK WITH VICTOR. HE EVEN BEGAN WRITING AGAIN. IT WAS AN ILLEGIBLE SCRAWL BUT VICTOR MANAGED TO MAKE IT OUT MORE OR LESS. SARTRE WROTE ON THE LIMITS OF HIS ADHERENCE TO HIS OWN VALUES. “I DON’T BELIEVE IN WHAT I’VE WRITTEN” HE TOLD ME. BUT THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS CRITICIZING HIMSELF ON THE BASIS OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS AND THE CRITIQUE THUS PROVING THAT HE DID BELIEVE IN IT.

1976
AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH SARTRE DICTATED AN ARTICLE ON PASOLINI TO ME. HE HAD MET HIM IN ROME AND HE LIKED SOME OF HIS FILMS PARTICULARLY THE FIRST PART OF MEDEA WHICH HE CONSIDERED AN EXTRAORDINARY EVOCATION OF THE HOLY. IN THIS ARTICLE HE REFLECTED UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF PASOLINI’S DEATH. HE FIRST WROTE IT IN HIS ILLEGIBLE HAND AND THEN RECITED IT TO ME BY HEART. IT WAS A GOOD ARTICLE AND IT APPEARED IN THE CORRIERE DELLA SERA OF MARCH 14 1976. HE WAS PLEASED WITH HAVING MANAGED TO PRODUCE IT IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS. LIKE ME VICTOR THOUGHT THAT SARTRE HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH GOOD FORM INTELLECTUALLY FOR A LONG WHILE. TO BE SURE SOMETIMES HIS LIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE GONE OUT BUT THAT WAS WHEN THE GATHERING WAS TOO LARGE OR WHEN PEOPLE BORED HIM. HE COULD BE FULL OF LIFE AND IMMEDIATELY PRESENT AS HE WAS DURING THE EVENING WE SPENT WITH ALICE SCHWARZER FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT ALTHOUGH HE COULD LISTEN REPLY AND DISCUSS HE WAS NO LONGER INVENTIVE. THERE WAS A KIND OF EMPTINESS WITHIN HIM AND THAT IS WHY EATING AND DRINKING TOOK ON A MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE FOR HIM THAN THEY HAD HAD IN EARLIER DAYS. HE FOUND IT HARD TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO NEW THINGS. AND HE FOUND BEING CONTRADICTED VERY HARD TO BEAR. I ALMOST NEVER DID IT ALTHOUGH HE MADE ENORMOUS BLUNDERS ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST.

ON MARCH 20 WE SET OFF WITH SYLVIE FOR VENICE A CITY THAT THE THREE OF US NEVER TIRED OF. TAKING VERY SHORT STEPS SARTRE WENT FOR QUITE LONG WALKS WITH ME. “DOESN’T IT BORE YOU BEING WITH A LITTLE CREATURE WHO WALKS SO SLOWLY?” HE ONCE ASKED ME. QUITE SINCERELY I SAID NO. THE FACT THAT HE COULD WALK AT ALL WAS ALREADY ENOUGH TO MAKE ME HAPPY. SOMETIMES IN A MELANCHOLY VOICE HE WOULD STILL SAY “I SHALL NEVER GET MY EYES BACK.” AND IT MADE HIM SAD WHEN A PASSENGER IN A VAPORETTO TOOK HIS ARM TO HELP HIM GET OUT AT THE STOPPING PLACE. “DO I REALLY LOOK LIKE A CRIPPLE?” HE ASKED ME. “YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU SEE BADLY” I SAID “THERE’S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF IN THAT!” BUT THESE CLOUDS SOON VANISHED. AS I WAS SUFFERING FROM A KIND OF NEURALGIA IN MY RIGHT ARM I SAID TO HIM “WELL WHAT OF IT? IT’S OLD AGE. ONE ALWAYS HAS ONE DAMNED THING OR ANOTHER.” “NOT ME” HE SAID WITH CONVICTION. “THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.” THAT MADE ME LAUGH AND AFTER A MOMENT’S THOUGHT HE LAUGHED TOO. BUT ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT HE HAD FELT THAT HE WAS QUITE UNDAMAGED. HE WAS MUCH BETTER ADAPTED TO HIS STATE THAN HE HAD BEEN THE YEAR BEFORE.

BACK IN PARIS ONCE MORE HE CARRIED ON HIS WORK WITH VICTOR. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPRING—SUN GREENERY FLOWERS IN HIS GARDEN AND BIRDS SINGING. READING MUSIC AND FILMS FILLED OUR AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR LIFE SITUATIONS HAD COME OUT. IT BROUGHT TOGETHER FOUR POLITICAL ESSAYS A TALK ON THE FAMILY IDIOT THE TALK WITH ME ON FEMINISM AND THE LONG INTERVIEW HE HAD GIVEN CONTAT “SELF-PORTRAIT AT SEVENTY.” GALLIMARD REPUBLISHED BEING AND NOTHINGNESS IN THE COLLECTION “TEL” AND SITUATIONS I IN THE SERIES “IDÉES.” A TRANSLATION OF THE CRITIQUE OF DIALECTICAL REASON APPEARED IN LONDON (IT HAD BEEN TRANSLATED INTO GERMAN IN 1967). SARTRE’S INTERVIEWS ON THE AUSTRALIAN RADIO—ON MARXISM ON LAING AND ON THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUAL—WERE COLLECTED IN A VOLUME THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK. ON MAY 1 HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW FOR THE PRESS BOOK OF THE FILM SARTRE BY HIMSELF AND IN IT HE SPOKE OF HIS DIFFERENCES WITH FRENCH TELEVISION. IN JUNE HE PUBLISHED A LETTER IN LIBÉRATION ABOUT THE LARZAC: HE WAS SORRY THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE PRESENT AT THE MEETINGS ON THE LARZAC AT WHITSUN. IN THE SAME MONTH LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR BROUGHT OUT A SHORT PIECE THAT HE HAD WRITTEN ON WORKERS’ SAFETY IN LARGE CONCERNS.

HE ALSO SIGNED A MANIFESTO OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE MARGE GROUP WHICH HAD OCCUPIED AN ANNEX OF THE SOVIET EMBASSY ON JANUARY 20. IN THE LIBÉRATION OF JANUARY 28 HE SIGNED AN APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IN FAVOR OF JEAN PAPINSKI A PRIMARY-SCHOOL TEACHER PROVISIONALLY ATTACHED TO A SECONDARY SCHOOL. IN 1966 WHILE PAPINSKI WAS TEACHING A CLASS IN ENGLISH AN INSPECTOR APPEARED; THE INSPECTOR DID NOT KNOW ENGLISH BUT HE NEVERTHELESS MADE AN UNFAVORABLE REPORT THAT CAUSED PAPINSKI TO BE SENT BACK TO PRIMARY-SCHOOL TEACHING. PAPINSKI ASKED FOR REDRESS; HE DID NOT OBTAIN IT. IN 1974 HE PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET ENTITLED BOUI-BOUI IN WHICH HE ATTACKED THE INSPECTORS THE JURIES AND UNFAIR PROMOTION. HIS NAME WAS STRUCK OFF THE ROLL OF TEACHERS FOR LIFE AND HE BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE (IT WAS TO LAST FOR NINETY DAYS).

IN LIBÉRATION ON FEBRUARY 17 AND LE MONDE ON FEBRUARY 18 SARTRE FIFTY NOBEL PRIZEWINNERS AND I SIGNED AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF DR. MIKHAÏL STERN. TOGETHER WE CONDUCTED A CAMPAIGN IN HIS FAVOR AND IN THE END WE WON. ON MAY 12 SARTRE AND SOME OTHER INTELLECTUALS SIGNED A COMMUNIQUÉ IN WHICH THEY EXPRESSED THEIR HORROR AT THE DEATH OF ULRIKE MEINHOF IN A GERMAN PRISON.

THAT YEAR AFTER A MONTH’S SEPARATION WHICH SARTRE SPENT AT JUNAS WITH ARLETTE AND THEN IN VENICE WITH WANDA WHILE I TRAVELED IN SPAIN WITH SYLVIE ONCE MORE WE ALL THREE SARTRE SYLVIE AND I WENT TO CAPRI. WE STAYED AT THE HOTEL QUISISANA AND WE SPENT NEARLY THREE WEEKS THERE VERY HAPPILY—CAPRI WAS A PLACE THAT SARTRE LOVED ABOVE ALL OTHERS. EARLY EVERY AFTERNOON WE WENT TO HAVE A DRINK AT THE SALOTTO. SARTRE EVEN WENT FOR TWO LONG WALKS IN THE PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE CARS ARE FORBIDDEN; HE RESTED ON A BENCH NOW AND THEN BUT HIS LEGS DID NOT HURT HIM. HE LIKED SITTING IN THE SUN AS WE LUNCHED IN AN OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT. FROM HIS WINDOW HE WAS AWARE OF THE BEAUTY OF THE LANDSCAPE RUNNING GENTLY DOWN TO THE BLUE OF THE SEA.

WE DROVE BACK TO ROME—WE HAD LEFT THE CAR IN A GARAGE IN NAPLES—AND RETURNED TO OUR CUSTOMARY TERRACE APARTMENT. SYLVIE LEFT US THE NEXT DAY AND SARTRE AND I STAYED ON ALONE FOR A FORTNIGHT. IT WAS THE SAME PLEASANT ROUTINE AS IN OTHER YEARS. PART OF THE PANTHEON SQUARE AND THE NEARBY STREETS WERE NOW RESERVED FOR PEDESTRIANS AND WE OFTEN WALKED THERE. WE LUNCHED IN THE PIAZZA NAVONA WITH BASSO AND HIS WIFE. JOSÉE DAYAN AND MALKA RIBOWSKA WHOM WE HAD MET BY CHANCE IN VENICE AND WHOM I HAD SEEN SINCE CAME TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE ADAPTATION OF THE WOMAN DESTROYED FOR TELEVISION. SARTRE LIKED THEM AND WE HAD DINNER TOGETHER. AT THE END OF OUR STAY THE BOSTS CAME TO SEE US AND ACCOMPANIED US TO THE AIRPORT WHERE WE TOOK OFF FOR GREECE.

SARTRE HAD IN FACT PROMISED MELINA TO COME TO ATHENS TO SEE HER; WE STAYED THERE A WEEK. HE SPENT THE DAYS WITH ME THE EVENINGS WITH HER. WE COULD NOT GET ROOMS IN THE HOTEL WE LIKED AND THOSE IN WHICH WE DID STAY NEXT DOOR WERE UTTERLY DISMAL. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A DAZZLING SUN WE HAD TO HAVE THE LIGHTS ON FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT. FORTUNATELY I HAD WORK TO DO. I WENT OVER THE ADAPTATION AND WROTE DIALOGUES FOR THE WOMAN DESTROYED.

PARIS ONCE MORE IN MID-SEPTEMBER AND LIFE BEGAN AGAIN IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE YEAR BEFORE APART FROM A FEW CHANGES OF TIMETABLE. UNTIL MID-OCTOBER THE WEATHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND THIS TENDED TO MAKE US FEEL OPTIMISTIC. FURTHERMORE SARTRE WAS VERY FIT INDEED AND THINGS WERE GOING WELL FOR HIM. HE HAD GIVEN UP ATTENDING THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETINGS BUT HE WAS WORKING WITH VICTOR WITH GREAT ZEST AND ON ALL SIDES PEOPLE WERE PERPETUALLY ASKING HIM TO DO THINGS. IN OCTOBER HE TOOK PART IN A MEETING IN FAVOR OF THE SOVIET POLITICAL PRISONERS AND CALLED FOR THE LIBERATION OF KUZNETSOV. TOGETHER WITH LE BRIS AND LE DANTEC HE SIGNED A FOREWORD TO BOMMI BAUMAN’SAQ BOOK TUPAMAROS BERLIN-OUEST WHICH CAME OUT IN THE “FRANCE SAUVAGE” SERIES. THIS WAS THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A FORMER GERMAN TERRORIST AND THE GERMAN POLICE HAD SEIZED IT IN 1975; SARTRE HAD JOINED HEINRICH BÖLL IN CALLING FOR ITS REPUBLICATION. AND NOW IT WAS BEING BROUGHT OUT IN FRENCH. “BOMMI BAUMAN’S TENETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY OURS” WROTE SARTRE “BUT THEY DIRECTLY CHALLENGE UNTAMED FRANCE.”AR

IN SEPTEMBER DIRTY HANDS WAS PUT ON AGAIN AT THE THÉÂTRE DES MATHURINS. THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERFORMANCES FOLLOWED BY A TOUR IN THE PROVINCES. THE REVIEWS APART FROM THAT OF MARCABRU WERE EXCELLENT. THE FILM SARTRE BY HIMSELF CAME OUT AT THE END OF OCTOBER. ONCE AGAIN THE CRITICS PRAISED SARTRE ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND THE PUBLIC FLOCKED TO SEE IT. LE MAGAZINE LITTÉRAIRE PUBLISHED A LONG AND VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION BETWEEN SARTRE AND MICHEL SICARD ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FAMILY IDIOT.AS TWO ISSUES OF POLITIQUE-HEBDO WERE DEVOTED TO HIM; THEY CONTAINED ARTICLES BY CHÂTELET HORST AND VICTOR.

“WHAT A SPLENDID COMEBACK!” I SAID. “A FUNERARY COMEBACK” HE REPLIED BUT HE LAUGHED AS HE DID SO. IN FACT HE WAS QUITE DELIGHTED. SARTRE WAS MUCH TOO PROUD EVER TO HAVE INDULGED IN VANITY. LIKE ALL WRITERS HE WAS CONCERNED FOR THE SUCCESS OF HIS WORK AND ITS INFLUENCE. BUT FOR HIM THE PAST WAS LEFT BEHIND AT ONCE AND IT WAS ON THE FUTURE THAT HE STAKED EVERYTHING—HIS NEXT BOOK HIS NEXT PLAY. HE NOW NO LONGER EXPECTED MUCH FROM THE FUTURE. YET HE CERTAINLY DID NOT BROOD ANXIOUSLY OVER HIS PAST. SEVERAL TIMES HE REPEATED THAT HE HAD DONE WHAT HE HAD TO DO AND HE WAS SATISFIED. BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO FEEL CAST ASIDE AND FORGOTTEN EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY FOR A WHILE. SINCE HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO ENGAGE IN FRESH PLANS WITH ALL HIS OLD ENERGY HE AND WHAT HE HAD ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED COINCIDED. HE LOOKED UPON HIS WORK AS FINISHED; IT WAS BY MEANS OF IT THAT HE COULD BE KNOWN AS HE WISHED TO BE KNOWN.

ON SUNDAY NOVEMBER 7 AT THE ISRAELI EMBASSY HE RECEIVED THE UNIVERSITY OF JERUSALEM’S DEGREE OF DOCTOR HONORIS CAUSA. IN HIS SPEECH (CAREFULLY PREPARED AND MEMORIZED) HE STATED THAT HE ACCEPTED THE DEGREE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS. “I HAVE BEEN ISRAEL’S FRIEND FOR A LONG WHILE. HERE I AM CONCERNED WITH ISRAEL BUT I AM ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL.” THE SPEECH APPEARED IN LES CAHIERS BERNARD LAZARE. SOON AFTER THIS SARTRE GAVE EDITH SOREL AN INTERVIEW WHICH APPEARED IN LA TRIBUNE JUIVE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER.AT HE SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT WRITE ANTI-SEMITE AND JEW IN QUITE THE SAME WAY AT PRESENT. HE SPOKE OF HIS TRAVELS IN EGYPT AND IN ISRAEL IN 1967 AND SAID THAT IF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAIRO OFFERED HIM A DEGREE HE WOULD ACCEPT IT.

IN NOVEMBER THE NEW LEFT REVIEW BEGAN THE PUBLICATION OF A LONG SECTION OF VOLUME II OF THE CRITIQUE OF DIALECTICAL REASON. IN THIS SARTRE REFLECTED UPON SOVIET SOCIETY AND UPON “SOCIALISM IN A SINGLE COUNTRY.” THESE PAGES WERE MORE PHILOSOPHICAL THAN HISTORICAL AND THEY WERE THEREFORE A PROLONGATION OF VOLUME I SINCE THE SECOND WAS INTENDED TO MOVE ON TO THE SUBJECT OF CONCRETE HISTORY.

IN THE LIBÉRATION OF NOVEMBER 12 HE PUBLISHED A LETTER SUPPORTING THE FIVE CORSICANS DETAINED IN LYONS. ON DECEMBER 13 IN AN INTERVIEW HE GAVE POLITIQUE-HEBDO HE DENOUNCED THE DANGER ARISING FROM THE GERMAN-AMERICAN HEGEMONY IN EUROPE. HE THEN TOOK PART IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMITÉ D’ACTION CONTRE L’EUROPE GERMANO-AMÉRICAINE IN WHICH ONE OF THE MOVING SPIRTS WAS J.-P. VIGIER.

MELINA CAME TO SPEND A WEEK IN PARIS AND HE SAW A GREAT DEAL OF HER. HE ENJOYED SEEING HER MUCH LESS THAN HE HAD IN ATHENS FINDING HER “EMPTY” BUT HE STILL FELT AFFECTION FOR HER.

THE TEMPS MODERNES COMMITTEE WAS MUCH DIMINISHED. BOST WHO COULD NOT HEAR WELL NO LONGER CAME AND ALL LANZMANN’S TIME WAS EATEN UP BY THE FILM HE WAS MAKING ON THE HOLOCAUST. IT SEEMED TO US THAT WE SHOULD CO-OPT SOME NEW MEMBERS. WE CHOSE PIERRE VICTOR THANKS TO WHOM SARTRE HAD STARTED TO COME TO THE MEETINGS AGAIN; FRANÇOIS GEORGE WHO HAD OFTEN CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAGAZINE; RIGOULOT A YOUNG TEACHER OF PHILOSOPHY WHO HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED AND WHO HAD WRITTEN A LETTER THAT TOUCHED US DEEPLY; AND PIERRE GOLDMAN FOR WHOM WE ALL HAD THE GREATEST ESTEEM. HE CAME TO SEE SARTRE ONE EVENING WITH LANZMANN AND AT ONCE I FELT A GREAT LIKING FOR HIM; SO DID SARTRE BUT AS IT OFTEN HAPPENED IF UNKNOWN PEOPLE WERE PRESENT HE DID NOT UTTER A WORD. WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE AGAIN HE SPOKE OF IT WITH CONCERN. I COMFORTED HIM AS WELL AS I COULD. ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN HORST AND HIS WIFE CAME TO HAVE A DRINK WITH US ANOTHER EVENING HE WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE BECAUSE HE WAS SO USED TO THEM.

1977
ON THE WHOLE HE WAS REMARKABLY WELL. NO FURTHER TROUBLE WITH HIS HEALTH. HE DID HAVE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING AND HE SMOKED FAR TOO MUCH FOR THERE TO BE ANY HOPE OF AN IMPROVEMENT; HE ALSO FOUND IT HARD TO SWALLOW. BUT HIS MOOD WAS EXCELLENT. “AT PRESENT I AM THOROUGHLY HAPPY” HE TOLD ME. ALTHOUGH HE THOUGHT HIS “COMEBACK” FUNERARY THE ARTICLES ABOUT HIM GAVE HIM GREAT PLEASURE. HIS INTELLIGENCE WAS INTACT. IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ AND TO REREAD HIS OWN WRITING I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED NEW IDEAS. FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS WORKING WITH VICTOR ON A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE MEANING OF THEIR COLLABORATION AND THE REASONS FOR IT A DIALOGUE THAT APPEARED IN THE LIBÉRATION OF JANUARY 6 1977.

HE STATED THAT THE NEW FORM OF HIS FUTURE BOOK POUVOIR ET LIBERTÉ (POWER AND FREEDOM) WAS DUE NOT ONLY TO HIS DISABILITIES; IT WAS DUE ALSO TO THE FACT THAT HE VERY EARNESTLY WISHED THAT A WE SHOULD BE APPARENT IN IT. FOR HIM THIS BOOK WAS “THE ETHICS AND THE POLITICS THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FINISHED AT THE END OF MY LIFE.” THE PROSPECT OF ITS BEING A JOINT THOUGHT MADE HIM HESITATE BECAUSE HE STILL BELIEVED THAT ONE COULD THINK ONLY BY ONESELF ALONE. BUT HE HOPED TO ATTAIN A THOUGHT BY THE WE: “IT WOULD CALL FOR A THOUGHT THAT IS GENUINELY FORMED BY YOU AND BY ME AT THE SAME TIME IN THE ACT OF THINKING TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGES IN EACH OF US THAT THE OTHER’S THOUGHT BRINGS ABOUT; AND WE SHOULD HAVE TO ATTAIN A THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE OURS THAT IS A THOUGHT IN WHICH YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF BUT AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZE ME AND I RECOGNIZE MYSELF IN RECOGNIZING YOU.…

“YET AFTER ALL MINE IS A CURIOUS SITUATION; BROADLY SPEAKING I’VE FINISHED MY LITERARY CAREER. THE BOOK THAT WE ARE NOW WORKING ON IS A BOOK BEYOND THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN. IT’S NOT ALTOGETHER A LIVING MAN AN OLDER LIVING MAN WHO WOULD BE TALKING WITH YOU. I’M SOMEWHAT DETACHED FROM MY WORKS.… WITH YOU I SHOULD LIKE … TO PRODUCE A WORK THAT IS BEYOND MY OWN WORKS.

“I AM NOT DEAD IN FACT; I EAT AND I DRINK. BUT I AM DEAD IN THAT MY LITERARY WORK IS FINISHED.… MY RELATIONS WITH EVERYTHING I’VE WRITTEN HITHERTO ARE NO LONGER THE SAME—I WORK WITH YOU; YOU HAVE IDEAS THAT ARE NOT MINE AND THAT WILL MAKE ME GO IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS THAT I USED NOT TO TAKE SO THAT I PRODUCE SOMETHING NEW; I PRODUCE IT AS A LAST WORK AND AT THE SAME TIME AS A WORK SET APART NOT BELONGING TO THE WHOLE THOUGH NATURALLY POSSESSING SOME CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON WITH IT—THE COMPREHENSION OF FREEDOM FOR EXAMPLE.”

OBVIOUSLY THE AMBIGUITY OF THE SITUATION WORRIED SARTRE BUT HE TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT: THAT IS HE SUCCEEDED IN CONVINCING HIMSELF THAT IT HAD POSITIVE ASPECTS FOR HIM.

MEANWHILE HE HAD BECOME ALMOST INCAPABLE OF WALKING. HE HAD PAINS IN HIS LEFT LEG—CALF THIGH ANKLE. AND HE WAS UNSTEADY ON HIS FEET. DR. LAPRESLE ASSURED US THAT HIS VASCULAR TROUBLES HAD GROWN NO WORSE AND THAT THIS WAS ONLY SCIATICA. SARTRE STAYED IN HIS ROOM FOR TWO WEEKS BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE WAS NO BETTER. HIS LEG HURT HIM IN THE NIGHT AND HIS FOOT DURING THE DAY. UNTIL DECEMBER HE HAD REACHED THE NEARBY BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT QUITE EASILY; NOW IN JANUARY HE HAD TO STOP THREE TIMES ON THE WAY AND HE WOULD ARRIVE OUT OF BREATH AND IN PAIN.

WHEN EITHER ARLETTE OR I SPENT THE EVENING WITH SARTRE WE SLEPT THERE. BUT ON SATURDAYS WANDA WAS WITH HIM UNTIL ELEVEN O’CLOCK AND IT WAS AWKWARD BOTH FOR ARLETTE AND FOR ME TO GO TO HIS PLACE SO LATE AT NIGHT. MICHÈLE SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD COME AFTER WANDA LEFT AND SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR. THIS ARRANGEMENT SUITED EVERYBODY AND WE KEPT TO IT FOR A LONG WHILE.

BUT ONE SUNDAY WHEN SARTRE WAS HAVING LUNCH WITH SYLVIE AND ME AT LA PALETTE WE THOUGHT HE APPEARED STRANGE—HALF ASLEEP. ABOUT NINE THAT EVENING HE FELT SO ILL THAT I CALLED A DOCTOR DIALING S.O.S.: HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS 250. AFTER AN INJECTION IT DROPPED TO 140. THIS SUDDEN DROP MADE HIM FEEL POORLY THE NEXT DAY. DR. COURNOT CAME AND AS LILIANE WAS THERE HE TOOK HER ASIDE AND ASKED “HAD HE BEEN DRINKING?” SHE SAID YES. SHE HAD NOT LIKED TO LET ME KNOW BUT SARTRE HAD TOLD HER THAT WHEN MICHÈLE WAS WITH HIM ON SATURDAY EVENING HE HAD DRUNK HALF A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. HE ADMITTED IT TO ME AS WELL. I TELEPHONED MICHÈLE TELLING HER WHY SHE WAS NO LONGER TO COME TO SARTRE’S ON SATURDAYS. SOME DAYS LATER SHE SAID TO HIM “I WANTED TO HELP YOU DIE CHEERFULLY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU WANTED.” BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE AT ALL. FROM THIS TIME ON WHEN I LEFT HIM ON SATURDAY EVENING I POURED HIM OUT A RATION OF WHISKEY AND HID THE BOTTLE. AFTER WANDA HAD GONE HE WOULD DRINK AND SMOKE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN GO QUIETLY TO BED.

AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY WE HAD A SPLENDID FEASTLIKE LUNCHEON AT SYLVIE’S HOME. GALLIMARD BROUGHT OUT THE FULL TEXT OF THE FILM SARTRE BY HIMSELF WITH GREAT SUCCESS. HE GAVE CATHERINE CHAINE AN INTERVIEW ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN AND IT APPEARED IN LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR FOR JANUARY 31. HE ATTENDED THE TEMPS MODERNES ASSEMBLIES WHICH NOW MET TWO WEDNESDAY MORNINGS A MONTH IN HIS APARTMENT AND TOOK PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS. CARRIED AWAY BY HIS HABIT OF ALWAYS SAYING YES HE AGREED TO SIGN AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED IN LE MONDE ON APRIL 10 1977 AND THAT WAS IN FACT WRITTEN BY VIGIER AFTER A TALK WITH HIM. IN THIS HE STATED THAT “SINCE ITS REESTABLISHMENT IN 1945 GERMAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY VALUED INSTRUMENTS OF AMERICAN IMPERIALISM IN EUROPE” AND HE CALLED UPON MILITANT SOCIALISTS “TO FIGHT AGAINST GERMAN-AMERICAN HEGEMONY” BY SETTING THEMSELVES AGAINST A CERTAIN WAY OF BUILDING EUROPE. THE STYLE DID NOT RESEMBLE SARTRE’S IN THE LEAST AND AN APPEAL TO THE SOCIALISTS WAS VERY SURPRISING COMING FROM HIM. LANZMANN POUILLON VICTOR AND OTHERS DID NOT HIDE THEIR DISAPPROVAL.

HE HAD PROMISED MELINA TO GO AND GIVE A LECTURE IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS WHERE SHE WORKED. HE AND PIERRE VICTOR LEFT BY PLANE ON WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 16 AND HE STAYED THERE A WEEK LUNCHING WITH VICTOR DINING WITH MELINA MENTALLY PREPARING HIS LECTURE. THE SUBJECT WAS “WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY?” AND HE PRESENTED IT ON TUESDAY THE TWENTY-SECOND BEFORE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN A HALL MEANT FOR EIGHT HUNDRED. HE SPOKE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND WAS THUNDEROUSLY APPLAUDED. VICTOR THOUGHT THE LECTURE SOMEWHAT “FACILE” BUT SINCE MOST OF THE STUDENTS HAD A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF FRENCH HE ADMITTED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POINTLESS TO ATTEMPT DIFFICULT CONCEPTS. I WENT TO PICK THEM UP NEXT DAY AT THE ORLY AIRPORT. AS I WATCHED THE PASSENGERS FILING PAST ONE OF THEM TOLD ME IN A REASSURING TONE “THEY’RE COMING.” AND INDEED THERE THEY WERE THE VERY LAST TO APPEAR SARTRE RATHER TIRED AFTER HIS LONG WALK FROM THE PLANE BUT DELIGHTED WITH HIS JOURNEY.

ON MARCH 9 MELINA CAME TO PARIS. THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE NINE SHE TELEPHONED ME IN A PANIC. SARTRE HAD TAKEN HER TO DINE AT THE BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT. ON THE WAY BACK HIS LEGS HAD GIVEN WAY UNDER HIM AND TWICE HE HAD NEARLY FALLEN; NEIGHBORS HAD PRACTICALLY CARRIED HIM TO THE ELEVATOR. HE WAS DEATHLY PALE SWEATING AND OUT OF BREATH. I TELEPHONED ZAIDMANN AND HURRIED OVER TO SARTRE’S.AU HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS 220. MELINA ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD NOT DRUNK TOO MUCH AND I KNEW THAT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW SHE ALWAYS KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON HIM. ANYWAY HIS HEAD WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR. I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH HIM. DR. COURNOT CAME THAT EVENING AND SPOKE OF A SPASM IN ONE LEG. THE NEXT DAY ARLETTE CALLED ME TO SAY THAT SARTRE HAD FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES PARTICULARLY WHEN GOING TO BED.

DR. COURNOT RETURNED. ALTHOUGH SARTRE’S BLOOD PRESSURE HAD GONE DOWN A GREAT DEAL COURNOT ASKED HIM TO GO TO THE BROUSSAIS HOSPITAL FOR A CHECKUP. I SLEPT AT HIS APARTMENT AS I DID EVERY TUESDAY AND AT HALF PAST EIGHT IN THE MORNING LILIANE CAME TO FETCH US. WE HELPED SARTRE CROSS THE GARDEN AND GO DOWN IN THE ELEVATOR TO THE CAR. HE COULD SCARCELY WALK. AT THE HOSPITAL A MALE NURSE TOOK HIM AWAY IN A WHEELCHAIR. THE DOCTORS DECIDED TO KEEP HIM UNTIL THE NEXT AFTERNOON. I STAYED IN HIS ROOM AND ATTENDED TO THE FORMALITIES OF SIGNING HIM IN WHILE HE UNDERWENT A NUMBER OF EXAMINATIONS. HE WAS BROUGHT LUNCH AND ATE MOST OF IT. HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS GOOD ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE LESS SO ON THE LEFT; A VERY MARKED ASYMMETRY. I STAYED UNTIL HALF PAST THREE SITTING BY SARTRE AND READING WHILE HE SLEPT UNTIL ARLETTE CAME.

I WENT BACK TO THE HOSPITAL THE NEXT MORNING. SARTRE HAD HAD DINNER HAD WATCHED A LITTLE TELEVISION AND HAD SLEPT WELL. THEY WERE NOW CARRYING OUT A LONG X-RAY EXAMINATION—THORAX LEGS HANDS AND SO ON. THEY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO HIS BED AND DR. HOUSSET APPEARED. HE SPOKE FORCIBLY. SARTRE COULD SAVE HIS LEGS ONLY BY GIVING UP TOBACCO. IF HE DID NOT SMOKE ANYMORE HIS STATE COULD BE MUCH IMPROVED AND HE COULD BE ASSURED OF A QUIET OLD AGE AND A NORMAL DEATH. OTHERWISE HIS TOES WOULD HAVE TO BE CUT OFF THEN HIS FEET AND THEN HIS LEGS. SARTRE SEEMED IMPRESSED. LILIANE AND I TOOK HIM HOME WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY. AS FOR TOBACCO HE SAID HE WANTED TO THINK IT OVER. HE SAW MELINA AND ARLETTE AND THEN THE NEXT DAY PIERRE AND MICHÈLE. WHEN I ARRIVED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS WALKING A LITTLE BETTER. BUT THE DAY AFTER THAT IN THE EVENING HE TOLD ME THAT HIS LEG HURT EVERY NIGHT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

ON SUNDAY SYLVIE HE AND I WENT TO SEE OUR FRIEND TOMIKO IN HER BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AT VERSAILLES. WE ATE A STUFFED DUCK AND DRANK SOME EXCELLENT WINE. AS WE DROVE BACK SYLVIE WHO WAS A LITTLE TIPSY MADE ARDENT DECLARATIONS TO SARTRE WHO WAS DELIGHTED. (SHE WAS NOT ALWAYS KIND TO HIM. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE IT THAT HE WAS ILL AND SOME ASPECTS OF HIS BEHAVIOR IRRITATED HER WHILE HE WOULD BLAME HER FOR WHAT HE CALLED HER “ILL TEMPER.” BUT NONE OF THIS AFFECTED THEIR RELATIONS IN ANY WAY.)

WE SPENT THE EVENING READING AND TALKING. HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO STOP SMOKING THE NEXT DAY MONDAY. I SAID “DOESN’T IT MAKE YOU SAD TO THINK YOU’RE SMOKING YOUR LAST CIGARETTE?” “NO. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I FIND THEM RATHER DISGUSTING NOW.” NO DOUBT HE ASSOCIATED THEM WITH THE IDEA OF BEING CUT TO PIECES LITTLE BY LITTLE. THE NEXT DAY HE HANDED ME HIS CIGARETTES AND LIGHTERS TO GIVE TO SYLVIE. AND THAT EVENING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS IN AN ASTONISHINGLY GOOD MOOD BECAUSE HE HAD STOPPED SMOKING. IT WAS A FINAL RENUNCIATION AND HE NEVER SEEMED TO FIND IT BURDENSOME. HE WAS NOT AFFECTED EVEN WHEN HIS FRIENDS SMOKED IN FRONT OF HIM—INDEED HE EVEN ENCOURAGED THEM TO DO SO.

THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY LILIANE AND I TOOK HIM TO A PRIVATE CONSULTATION WITH DR. HOUSSET. THE DOCTOR LOOKED THROUGH AN IMMENSE FILE DEVOTED TO SARTRE CONGRATULATED HIM ON HAVING GIVEN UP TOBACCO AND PRESCRIBED A SERIES OF INTRAVENOUS INJECTIONS. IF HE FELT THE SLIGHTEST CRAMP SARTRE WAS TO STOP WALKING; OTHERWISE THERE WAS THE DANGER OF A HEART ATTACK OR A STROKE. HE STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST THE BRIEF JOURNEY TO JUNAS THAT SARTRE HAD PLANNED AND HE HANDED US A THICK ENVELOPE THAT I WAS TO GIVE DR. COURNOT. WE TOOK SARTRE HOME AND AS SOON AS WE REACHED MY APARTMENT LILIANE AND I STEAMED HOUSSET’S LETTER OPEN. IT WAS A HIGHLY DETAILED SUMMARY LITTLE OF WHICH WE UNDERSTOOD. LILIANE KEPT IT TO SHOW ONE OF HER FRIENDS A MEDICAL WOMAN.

SHE TELEPHONED ME THE NEXT DAY. THE FRIEND THOUGHT THE SUMMARY VERY DISTURBING—ONLY 30 PERCENT CIRCULATION IN THE LEGS. “WITH CARE HE MAY LIVE A FEW YEARS MORE” SHE HAD SAID. A FEW YEARS! FOR ME THE WORD TOOK ON A TRAGIC MEANING. I WAS QUITE AWARE THAT SARTRE WOULD NOT LIVE VERY MUCH LONGER BUT SO VAGUE WAS THE PERIOD THAT LAY BETWEEN ME AND HIS END THAT IT SEEMED FAR OFF. ALL AT ONCE IT GREW NEAR. FIVE YEARS? SEVEN YEARS? IN ANY EVENT A FINITE DEFINITE TIME. DEATH THE INESCAPABLE WAS ALREADY THERE AND IT HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF SARTRE. MY GENERAL UNFOCUSED ANXIETY GAVE WAY TO A FUNDAMENTAL DESPAIR.

I TRIED TO FACE UP TO IT. I TOOK THE RESEALED LETTER BACK TO SARTRE’S APARTMENT WHERE IN ANY CASE DR. COURNOT LEFT IT OPEN ON THE TABLE. HE ADVISED SARTRE TO WALK VERY LITTLE DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR VENICE AND I PERSUADED SARTRE TO ORDER A WHEELCHAIR AT THE AIRPORT.

IN VENICE WE HAD THE SAME ROOMS THAT WE HAD HAD IN OTHER YEARS AND SARTRE WAS VERY PLEASED TO BE THERE AGAIN. BUT HE RARELY LEFT THE HOTEL. EVERY TIME WE WENT TO ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS HE LIKED IT WAS A LABORIOUS EXPEDITION. HE FOUND IT HARD TO GO EVEN AS FAR AS SAINT MARK’S SQUARE. SINCE THE WEATHER WAS DAMP AND RATHER SHOWERY HE COULD HARDLY EVER SIT ON THE CAFÉ TERRACES. STILL WHEN IT WAS FINE WE LUNCHED ON THE ONE BELONGING TO THE HOTEL WHICH OVERLOOKED THE GRAND CANAL. OTHERWISE WE CROSSED THE STREET AND SAT AT A TABLE IN HARRY’S BAR. FOR DINNER WE HAD A SANDWICH IN THE BAR OF THE HOTEL. HE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME IN HIS ROOM WHERE I READ TO HIM. WHEN HE SLEPT IN THE AFTERNOON OR WHEN HE WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC ON HIS TRANSISTOR I WENT OUT WITH SYLVIE. STILL WHEN WE WERE LEAVING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS STAY.

FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER OUR RETURN TO PARIS SARTRE SAW A GREAT DEAL OF MELINA. HE LIKED HER AGAIN. “WHEN I’M WITH HER I FEEL AS THOUGH I WERE THIRTY-FIVE” HE TOLD ME. LILIANE WHO HAD OFTEN SEEN THEM TOGETHER TOLD ME THAT HE DID INDEED GROW YOUNGER IN HER COMPANY. SO MUCH THE BETTER: THERE WERE SO FEW CHEERFUL THINGS LEFT IN HIS LIFE! ONCE AGAIN HIS LEGS WERE GIVING HIM A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN. ONE MORNING AS HE WAS GETTING UP HIS RIGHT FOOT HURT HIM SO MUCH THAT HE SAID “I CAN SEE THAT THEY CUT YOUR FEET OFF.” ASPIRIN SOOTHED HIS PAIN A LITTLE. FRESH INJECTIONS TOOK IT AWAY ALTOGETHER. BUT IT WAS STILL VERY HARD FOR HIM TO WALK. WHEN HE WAS ALONE WITH ME HE WAS OPEN AND FULL OF LIFE. BUT WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE THERE HE OFTEN BECAME WITHDRAWN CLOSED IN UPON HIMSELF. EVEN WITH BOST ONE EVENING HE DID NOT SAY A WORD. BOST OVERWHELMED SAID TO ME “HOW CAN ONE ACCEPT THAT SUCH A THING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM?”

IT WAS PRECISELY TO HIM I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD TO HAPPEN. AS FAR AS HE HIMSELF WAS CONCERNED HE HAD ALWAYS CARRIED OUT THE POLICY OF FULL EMPLOYMENT WITH NO TIME OFF. IF HE FELT TIRED HESITANT OR SLEEPY HE STUFFED HIMSELF WITH CORYDRANE. AN INBORN CONSTITUTIONAL NARROWNESS OF HIS ARTERIES DID PREDISPOSE HIM TO THE DISEASE THAT STRUCK HIM BUT THE LEAST ONE CAN SAY IS THAT HE DID NOTHING TO AVERT IT. HE PLAYED DUCKS AND DRAKES WITH HIS “CAPITAL OF HEALTH.” AND HE KNEW IT SINCE HE SAID IN EFFECT “I SHOULD RATHER DIE A LITTLE EARLIER AND HAVE WRITTEN THE CRITIQUE OF DIALECTICAL REASON.” INDEED I HAVE WONDERED WHETHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRODDECK’S BOOKS HE MAY NOT MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUSLY HAVE CHOSEN HIS CONDITION. HE DID NOT REALLY WANT TO WRITE THE LAST VOLUME OF THE FLAUBERT BUT HAVING NO OTHER PLAN FOR THE TIME BEING HE WOULD NOT RENOUNCE IT EITHER. WHAT WAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT? FOR MY PART I CAN PUT MYSELF OUT TO GRASS WITHOUT LIFE LOSING ALL ITS MEANING. SARTRE NO. HE LIKED LIVING—INDEED HE LOVED IT—BUT ON CONDITION OF BEING ABLE TO WORK. AS THE READER WILL HAVE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE WORK WAS AN OBSESSION WITH HIM. WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS INCAPABLE OF CARRYING THROUGH WHAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN HE OVERDID THE STIMULANTS AND HE SO INCREASED HIS ACTIVITIES AND EXCEEDED HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MADE A STROKE INEVITABLE. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT HE HAD NOT FORESEEN AND THAT HORRIFIED HIM WAS HIS NEAR-BLINDNESS. BUT HE HAD WANTED TO GRANT HIMSELF A REST AND FOR HIM ILLNESS WAS THE ONLY WAY OUT.

AT PRESENT I NO LONGER FULLY BELIEVE THIS HYPOTHESIS—TOO OPTIMISTIC A HYPOTHESIS IN ONE WAY SINCE IT MAKES SARTRE THE MASTER OF HIS FATE. WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE TRAGEDY OF HIS LAST YEARS WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS LIFE AS A WHOLE. IT IS TO HIM THAT ONE CAN APPLY RILKE’S WORDS: “EVERY MAN BEARS HIS DEATH WITHIN HIMSELF AS THE FRUIT BEARS ITS STONE.” SARTRE’S DECLINE AND DEATH WERE THOSE THAT HIS LIFE HAD CALLED FOR. AND PERHAPS THAT IS WHY HE ACCEPTED THEM SO SERENELY.

I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS; THIS SERENITY OF MIND WAS OBSCURED AT TIMES. MORE AND MORE OFTEN HE FELT THE NEED FOR A GLASS OF SPIRITS. JUST BEFORE THE VACATION I ASKED VICTOR WHAT HE THOUGHT OF SARTRE’S HEALTH. “HE’S GETTING WORSE” VICTOR REPLIED. AT THE END OF EACH CONVERSATION SARTRE ANGRILY INSISTED ON WHISKEY.

YET HE WAS FULL OF SMILES ON THAT JUNE 21 1977 HIS SEVENTY-SECOND BIRTHDAY WHEN TOGETHER WITH MANY OTHER INTELLECTUALS HE WELCOMED THE DISSIDENTS OF EASTERN EUROPE AT THE THÉÂTRE RÉCAMIER. AT THE SAME MOMENT GISCARD WAS RECEIVING BREZHNEV AT THE ELYSÉE. HE SAT NEXT TO DR. MIKHAIL STERN TO WHOSE LIBERATION SARTRE AND I HAD CONTRIBUTED AND WHO THANKED HIM VERY HEARTILY. SARTRE HAD BRIEF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE PRESENT.

IN THIS YEAR AS IN OTHERS HE SIGNED MANY DOCUMENTS ALL OF WHICH APPEARED IN LE MONDE: ON JANUARY 9 AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF POLITIQUE-HEBDO WHICH WAS IN DIFFICULTIES; ON JANUARY 23 AN APPEAL AGAINST THE REPRESSION IN MOROCCO; ON MARCH 22 A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT AT LAVAL IN SUPPORT OF YVAN PINEAU CHARGED WITH HAVING REFUSED HIS MILITARY PAPERS; ON MARCH 26 A PROTEST AGAINST THE ARREST OF A SINGER IN NIGERIA; ON MARCH 27 AN APPEAL FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE ARGENTINE; ON JUNE 29 A PETITION ADDRESSED TO THE BELGRADE CONFERENCE AGAINST REPRESSION IN ITALY; AND ON JULY 1 A PROTEST AGAINST THE WORSENING OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN BRAZIL.

IN A DIFFERENT VEIN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SARTRE AND THE MUSICOLOGIST LUCIEN MAISON APPEARED ON JULY 28. IN THIS SARTRE SPOKE ABOUT HIS MUSICAL TASTES AND DEPLORED THE NEW TURNING THAT FRANCE-MUSIQUE HAD TAKEN. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CHANNEL REPLIED TO HIS CRITICISMS IN THE NUMBER DATED AUGUST 7/8.

AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY SARTRE SET OFF BY CAR FOR JUNAS WITH ARLETTE PUIG AND ONE OF PUIG’S FRIENDS—A YOUNG WOMAN SARTRE LIKED VERY MUCH. BY THE WAY OF THE USUAL RELAYS HE WENT TO VENICE WITH WANDA AND THERE HE SPENT TWO WEEKS.AV I OFTEN TELEPHONED HIM AND HE SEEMED WELL. BUT I WAS STILL OVERWHELMED BY THE VERDICT PRONOUNCED BY LILIANE’S FRIEND: A FEW YEARS TO LIVE. AS I TRAVELED ABOUT AUSTRIA WITH SYLVIE HER PRESENCE AND MY INTEREST IN THE LANDSCAPES TOWNS AND MUSEUMS HELPED ME TO GET THE BETTER OF MY DISTRESS. BUT IN THE EVENINGS ALTHOUGH I TRIED TO BEAR UP AGAINST IT I FELL TO PIECES. I HAD TAKEN A TUBE OF VALIUM FROM SARTRE’S APARTMENT; NOW I SWALLOWED THE PILLS IN THE VAIN HOPE OF CALMING MY MIND AND I DRANK EXAGGERATED QUANTITIES OF WHISKEY. AS A RESULT MY LEGS GAVE WAY AND I STAGGERED. ONCE I NEARLY FELL INTO A LAKE AND ANOTHER TIME REACHING THE HOTEL HALL I COLLAPSED INTO AN ARMCHAIR AND THE PROPRIETRESS GAVE ME A VERY QUEER LOOK INDEED. FORTUNATELY I RALLIED IN THE MORNINGS AND WE SPENT SOME LOVELY DAYS.

WE WENT DOWN TO VENICE AND SYLVIE WAITED FOR ME WITH THE CAR IN THE PIAZZALE ROMA WHILE I TOOK A MOTORBOAT TO SARTRE’S HOTEL. AS USUAL IT WAS SOMETHING OF A SHOCK MEETING HIM IN THE HALL—HIS DARK GLASSES HIS AWKWARD WAY OF MOVING. WE AND SYLVIE DROVE OFF UNDER A MAGNIFICENT SKY. WE STOPPED AT FLORENCE WHERE I HAD RESERVED ROOMS AT THE EXCELSIOR ROOMS FLANKED BY TERRACES FROM WHICH ONE COULD SEE THE WHOLE CITY. AS WE DRANK OUR COCKTAILS IN THE BAR SARTRE FAIRLY BEAMED WITH PLEASURE AS HE HAD SO OFTEN DONE IN FORMER TIMES.

AT ABOUT TWO THE NEXT DAY WE REACHED ROME A DESERTED ROME. UNHAPPILY WE NO LONGER HAD OUR TERRACE APARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN LET TO AN AMERICAN FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. BUT I LIKED OUR NEW QUARTERS—TWO BEDROOMS SEPARATED BY A MINUTE DRAWING ROOM IN WHICH THERE PURRED A REFRIGERATOR. THIS TOO WAS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND WE HAD A MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF SAINT PETER’S AND SAW FABULOUS SUNSETS.

I THOUGHT SARTRE PERFECTLY WELL (APART FROM HIS LEGS; HE COULD SCARCELY WALK) DURING THE THIRTY-FIVE DAYS WE SPENT TOGETHER AT FIRST WITH SYLVIE AND THEN ALONE. HE DISCUSSED THE BOOKS I READ ALOUD TO HIM WITH GREAT ACUITY—PARTICULARLY THOSE WRITTEN BY SOVIET DISSIDENTS. ALTHOUGH BOST WAS INCLINED TO BE PESSIMISTIC WHERE SARTRE WAS CONCERNED HE WAS ASTONISHED BY HIS VITALITY WHEN HE AND OLGA CAME TO SEE US. THE DAY AFTER SYLVIE LEFT A LITTLE CAFÉ OPENED TEN YARDS FROM OUR HOTEL WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A GARAGE. EVERY DAY WE HAD LUNCH ON ITS TERRACE EATING A SANDWICH OR AN OMELETTE. AND SOMETIMES IN THE EVENING COMING BACK FROM THE RESTAURANT WHERE WE HAD DINED HAVING DRIVEN THERE IN A TAXI WE WOULD STOP AND HAVE A DRINK BEFORE GOING UP TO OUR ROOMS. IT WAS THERE THAT WE USUALLY ARRANGED TO MEET PEOPLE.

IN ROME THAT SUMMER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NERVOUS EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR. A STUDENT HAD BEEN KILLED AT BOLOGNA WHOSE MAYOR WAS A COMMUNIST. AN ENORMOUS LEFTIST DEMONSTRATION WAS TO BE HELD THERE ON SEPTEMBER 23 TO 25. SARTRE AS I HAVE SAID HAD SIGNED A MANIFESTO AGAINST THE REPRESSION IN ITALY. BY DOING SO HE HAD RAISED A STORM IN THE ITALIAN PRESS ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNIST PRESS. LOTTA CONTINUA AN EXTREME LEFT-WING PAPER WITH WHICH LES TEMPS MODERNES HAD EXCELLENT RELATIONS ASKED SARTRE FOR AN INTERVIEW ON THE QUESTION. M.-A. MACCIOCCHI URGED HIM TO SUPPORT THE BOLOGNA MEETINGS. ROSSANA ROSSANDA BEGGED HIM NOT TO DO SO; SHE FORESAW DISASTER. ON SEPTEMBER 15 AND IN THE LITTLE CAFÉ I HAVE JUST SPOKEN ABOUT SARTRE MET SEVERAL OF THE CHIEF MEN OF LOTTA CONTINUA. THEY PUBLISHED THE INTERVIEW IN FOUR PAGES OF THEIR ISSUE OF SEPTEMBER 19 UNDER THE HEADING LIBERTÁ E POTERE NON VANNO IN COPPIA. SARTRE SET OUT HIS IDEAS ON THE ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY THE HISTORIC COMPROMISE THE BAADER-MEINHOFF BAND THE EASTERN-EUROPEAN DISSIDENTS THE INTELLECTUALS’ ROLE WITH REGARD TO THE STATE AND THE PARTIES THE NEW PHILOSOPHERS AND MARXISM. HE SAID “EVERY TIME THE STATE POLICE FIRE ON A YOUNG MILITANT I AM ON THE YOUNG MILITANT’S SIDE.” HE ASSERTED HIS SOLIDARITY WITH THE YOUNG BUT HOPED THERE WOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AT BOLOGNA. HIS WORDS SATISFIED EVERYBODY INCLUDING ROSSANA ROSSANDA.

SARTRE HAD INDEED SPOKEN VERY WELL. AND IN OUR OWN CONVERSATIONS TOO I FOUND HIM HIS OLD SELF ENTIRELY. WE TALKED ABOUT OUR LIFE ABOUT OUR AGE ABOUT EVERYTHING AND NOTHING.

HE HAD GROWN OLDER CERTAINLY BUT HE WAS TRULY HIMSELF.

HIS HEART HAD ITS WHIMS. HE NO LONGER WANTED MELINA TO COME AND SEE HIM IN ROME OR US TO GO TO ATHENS AS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED. HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE HER THE MONEY TO LIVE IN PARIS THIS YEAR SINCE HE HAD PROMISED IT BUT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE HER ANYMORE. “SHE IS TOO SELF-SEEKING; SHE’S NOT WORTHWHILE. SHE NO LONGER MEANS ANYTHING TO ME.”

SHE REACHED PARIS A LITTLE AFTER OUR RETURN. “I STILL HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF AFFECTION FOR YOU” SARTRE TOLD HER “BUT I DON’T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.” SHE WEPT A LITTLE. AND HE SAW SOMETHING OF HER FROM TIME TO TIME.

THERE WERE MANY WOMEN IN HIS IMMEDIATE CIRCLE OLD FRIENDS AND NEWCOMERS. IN A DELIGHTED TONE HE SAID TO ME “I’VE NEVER BEEN SO SURROUNDED BY WOMEN!” HE DID NOT SEEM AT ALL UNHAPPY. “YES” HE SAID WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM “THE WORLD HAS A DIMENSION OF UNHAPPINESS NOW BUT I AM NOT UNHAPPY.” HE WAS SORRY THAT HIS SIGHT WAS SO BAD AND ABOVE ALL THAT HE COULD NOT SEE FACES; BUT HE FELT THOROUGHLY ALIVE. HIS READINGS WITH VICTOR INTERESTED HIM; THE TELEVISION AMUSED HIM; AND AT THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETINGS HE TOOK A MUCH GREATER PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HE HAD IN OTHER YEARS.

HE ALSO PAID GREAT ATTENTION TO POLITICAL EVENTS ESPECIALLY TO THE CASE OF KLAUS CROISSANT BAADER’S LAWYER. ON JULY 1 HE SIGNED AN APPEAL AGAINST HIS EXTRADITION AND ON OCTOBER 11 TOGETHER WITH THE COMMITTEE AGAINST A GERMAN-AMERICAN EUROPE A FRESH PROTEST. ON NOVEMBER 18 THIS SAME COMMITTEE ISSUED A COMMUNIQUÉ ON THE SCHLEYER AFFAIR. ON OCTOBER 28 HE P. H. HALBWACHS DANIEL GUÉRIN AND I SIGNED A WARNING AGAINST THE USE OF FORCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE POLISARIO FRONT. ON OCTOBER 30 HE SENT THE IRANIAN INTELLECTUALS WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE RÉGIME A TELEGRAM OF SUPPORT. ON DECEMBER 10 HE SIGNED AN APPEAL AGAINST THE EXPULSION OF THE PAINTER ANTONIO SAURA.

AT THE END OF NOVEMBER HE DICTATED TO ME A VERY HAPPILY CONCEIVED LITTLE PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION OF HIS PLAYS TAKING AN HOUR OVER IT.

THE T.E.P. INTENDED TO STAGE NEKRASSOV AGAIN; IT HAD NOT BEEN ACTED IN PARIS SINCE IT WAS FIRST PRODUCED IN 1955. IN OCTOBER SARTRE HAD A TALK ABOUT THE PLAY WITH GEORGES WERLER ANDRÉ AQUART AND MAURICE DELARUE AND IN DECEMBER HE MADE A STATEMENT ON THE SUBJECT. HE EMPHASIZED THAT HIS REAL PURPOSE HAD BEEN TO DENOUNCE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SENSATIONAL PRESS. “I WOULD NO DOUBT CHOOSE ANOTHER PRETEXT TODAY” HE SAID “BUT JUST AS I DID BEFORE I WOULD WILLINGLY ATTACK A CERTAIN KIND OF JOURNALISM THAT DOES NOT HESITATE TO ABUSE ITS READERS’ TRUST BY FABRICATING COMPLETELY UNTRUE SCANDALS.” WHEN SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED HIM FOR HAVING ALLOWED THIS REVIVAL HE REPLIED THAT ALL HIS PLAYS INCLUDING DIRTY HANDS NOW BELONGED TO THE THEATER’S REPERTORY AND THAT HE NO LONGER SAW ANY REASON FOR STOPPING THE PRODUCTION.

WHILE WE ARE ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OF THE EXTRAORDINARY MISCONCEPTION THAT ATTRIBUTED THE SLOGAN “DO NOT DRIVE BILLANCOURT TO DESPAIR” TO SARTRE.AW AS HIS OPPONENTS SAW IT OUT OF LOYALTY TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY (TO WHICH HE DID NOT BELONG) HE HAD SEEN FIT TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT CERTAIN EMBARRASSING TRUTHS: THIS HE NEVER DID. HE AND MERLEAU-PONTY WERE THE FIRST TO EXPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOVIET CAMPS IN LES TEMPS MODERNES. AND THIS INTEGRITY REMAINED UNALTERED IN LATER DAYS. ONE HAS BUT TO REREAD THE PLAY. VALÉRA A SWINDLER WHO PASSES HIMSELF OFF AS NEKRASSOV A SOVIET MINISTER WHO HAS “CHOSEN FREEDOM” IS PAID BY THE RIGHT-WING PRESS TO MAKE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE USSR ABOUT WHICH HE KNOWS NOTHING WHATSOEVER. VÉRONIQUE A YOUNG LEFT-WING MILITANT TELLS HIM THAT ALTHOUGH HE THINKS HE IS DECEIVING THE RICH HE IS IN FACT PLAYING THEIR GAME AND THAT HE WILL “DRIVE THE POOR TO DESPAIR” ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BILLANCOURT. VALÉRA IS APOLITICAL UNSCRUPULOUS AND GREEDY FOR MONEY. IN A DERISIVE TONE HE CRIES “BY ALL MEANS LET’S DRIVE BILLANCOURT TO DESPAIR!” NEITHER OF THEM SPEAKS FOR SARTRE.

THE FIRST PERFORMANCE WAS IN FEBRUARY 1978. MAURICE DELARUE WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF DULLIN’S PUPILS CAME TO SARTRE’S APARTMENT TO FETCH HIM AND OLGA (A FORMER COMRADE) AND BOST AND ME. HE DROVE US TO THE THEATER. SARTRE LIKED THE PRODUCTION AND THE ACTING. WHEN THE CURTAIN CAME DOWN WE WENT TO THE GREEN ROOM WHERE HE WARMLY CONGRATULATED WERLER AND THE PLAYERS.

EVER SINCE HIS 1967 JOURNEYS IN EGYPT AND ISRAEL SARTRE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE PROBLEMS OF THE MIDDLE EAST. SADAT’S VISIT TO ISRAEL STIRRED HIM DEEPLY. HE WROTE A SHORT STRIKING ARTICLE TO ENCOURAGE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL; IT APPEARED IN LE MONDE OF DECEMBER 4/5.

SYLVIE HE AND I ENDED THE YEAR VERY CHEERFULLY EATING TURKEY AT DOMINIQUE’S. SARTRE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS WORK AND HIS WAY OF LIFE. “ALL IN ALL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD TIME SINCE WE CAME BACK TO PARIS” HE SAID TO ME.

1978
HE STILL SAW MANY YOUNG WOMEN—MELINA AND SEVERAL OTHERS. ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS COMPLAINING OF WORKING TOO LITTLE WITH VICTOR I SAID TO HIM WITH A LAUGH “TOO MANY YOUNG LADIES!” “BUT IT’S USEFUL TO ME” HE REPLIED. AND INDEED I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS LARGELY TO THEM THAT HE OWED HIS TASTE FOR LIFE. WITH A NAIVE SELF-SATISFACTION HE TOLD ME “I’VE NEVER BEEN SO POPULAR WITH WOMEN BEFORE.”

OTHER FACTORS KEPT UP HIS OPTIMISM. LILIANE SIEGEL COLLECTED A NUMBER OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM; I WROTE BRIEF COMMENTARIES ON THEM AND THEY WERE PUBLISHED AS AN ALBUM BY GALLIMARD. MICHEL SICARD WAS PREPARING AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ABOUT SARTRE FOR THE MAGAZINE OBLIQUES AND THEY OFTEN DISCUSSED IT TOGETHER. JEANNETTE COLOMBEL AND MANY YOUNG PEOPLE CAME TO SEE HIM TO TALK ABOUT THE WORKS THEY WERE DEVOTING TO HIS PHILOSOPHY. GALLIMARD WAS GOING TO BRING OUT ALL HIS NOVELS IN THE PLÉIADE COLLECTION PREFACED BY MICHEL CONTAT. THE “COMEBACK” WAS CONTINUING AND HE APPRECIATED IT VERY MUCH INDEED.

YET HE DID HAVE ONE GRAVE ANXIETY: MONEY. EVER SINCE I HAD KNOWN HIM HE HAD BEEN UNFAILINGLY PRODIGAL AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD GIVEN AWAY EVERYTHING HE EARNED TO VARIOUS PEOPLE. AT THIS POINT HE WAS REGULARLY PAYING OUT QUITE LARGE SUMS EVERY MONTH TO DIFFERENT RECIPIENTS. HIS ALLOWANCE FROM GALLIMARD WAS SWALLOWED UP AT ONCE; HE HAD ALMOST NOTHING LEFT FOR HIS OWN NEEDS. IF I ASKED HIM TO BUY HIMSELF A NEW PAIR OF SHOES HE WOULD REPLY “I HAVEN’T THE MONEY.” IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE HIM ACCEPT THEM AS A GIFT. AND HE OWED HIS PUBLISHER A SUM HE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT. THIS POSITION BRED A POSITIVE ANXIETY IN HIM NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR ALL THOSE WHO DEPENDED ON HIM.

SINCE HE WANTED TO SEE THE RESULTS OF SADAT’S VISIT CLOSE AT HAND HE WENT TO JERUSALEM IN FEBRUARY ACCOMPANIED BY VICTOR AND ARLETTE WHO HAD BECOME FRIENDS. I WAS AFRAID THAT ALTHOUGH THIS JOURNEY WAS TO BE SHORT IT WOULD TIRE HIM BUT NOT AT ALL. AT ORLY A WHEELCHAIR TOOK HIM TO THE PLANE. WHEN IT LANDED ELI BEN GAL CAME TO FETCH HIM IN A CAR. ALL FOUR STAYED IN THE COMFORTABLE GUEST HOUSE FACING THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM; THEY ALSO SPENT A NIGHT IN A FINE HOTEL ON THE SHORES OF THE DEAD SEA. FOR FIVE DAYS SARTRE AND VICTOR TALKED WITH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS. THE TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE HIGH SEVENTIES AND THE SKY A SPLENDID BLUE. SARTRE WAS ENCHANTED. HE LOVED MOVING ABOUT LEARNING THINGS AND AS FAR AS HIS EYES WOULD LET HIM SEEING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. IF AS SOME SAY OLD AGE IS THE LOSS OF CURIOSITY HE WAS NOT OLD AT ALL.

OF HIS OWN ACCORD SARTRE WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN AN ARTICLE AFTER SO BRISK AN INVESTIGATION. VICTOR HAD FEWER SCRUPLES. “YOU MAOS ALWAYS GO TOO FAST” SARTRE HAD SAID TO HIM DURING ONE OF THEIR FIRST CONVERSATIONS. YET HE ALLOWED HIS HAND TO BE FORCED AND THEY SENT LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR A PIECE SIGNED WITH BOTH THEIR NAMES. BOST TELEPHONED ME IN A STATE OF GREAT AGITATION: “IT’S HORRIBLY BAD. HERE AT THE PAPER EVERYONE IS APPALLED. DO PERSUADE SARTRE TO WITHDRAW IT.” WHEN I HAD READ THE ARTICLE FINDING IT INDEED VERY WEAK I PASSED ON BOST’S REQUEST. “VERY WELL” SAID SARTRE CARELESSLY. BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO VICTOR HE FLEW INTO A RAGE. NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO INSULTED. HE BLAMED ME FOR NOT HAVING TOLD HIM ABOUT IT. I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SARTRE WOULD LOOK AFTER THAT BUT HE HAD NOT DONE SO NO DOUBT BECAUSE HE DID NOT CARE. I TOLD VICTOR ALL THIS AND FOR SOME TIME WE RETAINED AT LEAST THE APPEARANCE OF BEING ON GOOD TERMS. BUT PRESENTLY AT A TEMPS MODERNES CONFERENCE THAT MET AT MY APARTMENT WITHOUT SARTRE THERE WAS A VIOLENT QUARREL BETWEEN VICTOR POUILLON AND HORST ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ARTICLE—POUILLON AND HORST THOUGHT IT EXECRABLE. VICTOR INSULTED THEM DECLARING LATER THAT WE WERE ALL CORPSES AND HE NEVER TOOK PART IN THE MEETINGS AGAIN.

HIS REACTION ASTONISHED ME. WHEN WE WERE YOUNG SARTRE AND I HAD SUFFERED MANY REJECTIONS BUT NEVER HAD WE TAKEN THEM FOR INSULTS. VICTOR HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE GAUCHE PROLÉTARIENNE AND HE HAD RETAINED THE “LITTLE BOSS’S” STATE OF MIND—EVERYTHING HAD TO GIVE WAY BEFORE HIM. HE MOVED EASILY FROM ONE CONVICTION TO ANOTHER BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME OBSTINACY. FROM THE ILL-GOVERNED INTENSITY OF HIS VARIOUS ENTHUSIASMS HE DERIVED CERTAINTIES THAT HE WOULD NOT ALLOW TO BE CALLED INTO QUESTION. THIS GAVE HIS WORDS A VIGOR THAT SOME PEOPLE FOUND STIMULATING BUT WRITING CALLS FOR A CRITICAL ATTITUDE OF MIND THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS AND IF ANYONE DID ADOPT THIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO ANYTHING HE HAD WRITTEN HE FELT INJURED. FROM THAT TIME ON HE AND I NO LONGER SPOKE TO ONE ANOTHER; I AVOIDED ENCOUNTERING HIM IN SARTRE’S APARTMENT. IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION. UP UNTIL THEN SARTRE’S REAL FRIENDS HAD ALWAYS BEEN MINE TOO. VICTOR WAS THE ONLY EXCEPTION. I DID NOT DOUBT HIS AFFECTION FOR SARTRE NOR SARTRE’S FOR HIM. SARTRE TOLD CONTAT ABOUT IT IN ONE OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS. “ALL I WISH IS THAT MY WORK SHOULD BE CONTINUED BY OTHERS. FOR EXAMPLE I SHOULD LIKE PIERRE VICTOR TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK HE WANTS TO DO A WORK THAT IS BOTH THAT OF AN INTELLECTUAL AND A MILITANT. OF ALL THE PEOPLE I HAVE KNOWN HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES ME FULL SATISFACTION FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW.” HE APPRECIATED THE RADICAL NATURE OF VICTOR’S AMBITIONS AND THE FACT THAT LIKE SARTRE HIMSELF HE WANTED EVERYTHING. “OF COURSE YOU DON’T ATTAIN EVERYTHING BUT YOU MUST WANT EVERYTHING.” PERHAPS SARTRE WAS MISTAKEN BUT IF SO IT IS OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE. THAT WAS HOW HE SAW VICTOR. AT LONG INTERVALS HE WENT TO HAVE DINNER IN WHAT VICTOR CALLED HIS “COMMUNITY” A SUBURBAN HOUSE WHICH VICTOR AND HIS WIFE SHARED WITH ANOTHER COUPLE FRIENDS OF THEIRS. SARTRE ENJOYED THESE EVENINGS. I SHOULD NOT HAVE WISHED TO TAKE PART IN THEM BUT I WAS SORRY THAT FROM NOW ON A PART OF SARTRE’S LIFE WAS CLOSED TO ME.

WE WERE RATHER TIRED OF VENICE. FOR OUR EASTER HOLIDAY I CHOSE SIRMIONE A CHARMING LITTLE WALLED TOWN ON LAKE GARDA. CARS WERE NOT ALLOWED IN UNLESS ONE WAS STAYING THERE WHICH WAS THE CASE WITH US. WE HAD ROOMS IN A HOTEL ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE. AS USUAL I READ TO SARTRE IN HIS ROOM AND SINCE HE LIKED WALKING ABOUT THE NARROW AND EXCEPT ON SUNDAYS EMPTY STREETS WE OFTEN WENT AND SAT ON A CAFÉ TERRACE IN A NEARBY SQUARE. WE HAD OUR MEALS IN THE LITTLE RESTAURANTS CLOSE AT HAND. SYLVIE TOOK US FOR SOME LONG DRIVES. WE WENT AROUND THE LAKE AND WE REVISITED VERONA AND THEN ANOTHER DAY BRESCIA. ON OUR WAY BACK TO PARIS WE STOPPED AT THE AUBERGE DU PÈRE BISE AT TALLOIRES. GENERALLY SPEAKING SARTRE ATE IN A VERY MONOTONOUS SPARING FASHION BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN HE DID APPRECIATE A REALLY GOOD MEAL.

DURING THE MONTHS BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THE SUMMER VACATION HE UNDERTOOK FEW POLITICAL INITIATIVES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR A FALSE “SARTRE’S POLITICAL WILL AND TESTAMENT” HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN SICILY. THE AUTHOR UPHELD SOME OLD ANARCHIST THESES AND ATTRIBUTED THEM TO HIM. SARTRE PUBLISHED A DENIAL. IN JUNE HE WROTE TO LE MONDE SAYING THAT NOW TEN YEARS AFTER THE EVENTS OF 1968 COHN-BENDIT SHOULD NO LONGER BE FORBIDDEN TO COME TO FRANCE. IN THE SAME MONTH HE SIGNED A DOCUMENT ON THE CASE OF HEIDE KEMPE BÖLTCHER A GERMAN GIRL WHO HAD BEEN SEVERELY BURNED ON MAY 21 IN PARIS DURING A POLICE INTERROGATION.

BUT WHAT REALLY INTERESTED HIM WAS CARRYING ON WITH THE BOOK POUVOIR ET LIBERTÉ (POWER AND FREEDOM) THAT HE WAS WRITING WITH VICTOR. A TAPE RECORDER REGISTERED THEIR DIALOGUES. IN A PIECE THAT APPEARED IN OBLIQUES HE TOLD MICHEL SICARD HOW HE LOOKED UPON THIS WORK. “IF THE BOOK IS CARRIED RIGHT THROUGH TO ITS END IT WILL BE A NEW FORM … A GENUINE DISCUSSION BETWEEN TWO LIVING BEINGS WHO HAVE THE IDEAS THAT THEY AMPLIFY IN THEIR WRITING; AND WHEN WE ARE OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER IT WILL NOT BE FICTION BUT TRUTH … IN THIS BOOK THERE WILL BE MOMENTS OF CONFRONTATION AND MOMENTS OF AGREEMENT AND BOTH ARE IMPORTANT.… THIS BOOK WITH TWO AUTHORS IS ESSENTIAL FOR ME BECAUSE CONTRADICTION LIFE WILL BE IN THE BOOK. THE PEOPLE WHO READ IT … WILL ADOPT DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. THAT’S WHAT MOVES ME SO STRONGLY.”

THEN SUMMER CAME. AS I HAD DONE IN OTHER YEARS I MET SARTRE IN ROME AFTER A JOURNEY IN SWEDEN WITH SYLVIE; AND THERE WE SPENT SIX VERY HAPPY WEEKS.

WHEN WE RETURNED TO PARIS HIS HEALTH SEEMED STABILIZED. HE TALKED WITH VICTOR; I READ TO HIM. HE STILL TOOK PLEASURE IN HIS MANY FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS. MELINA HAD GONE BACK TO ATHENS BUT SHE WAS REPLACED BY OTHERS. AFTER THE “LOVE LETTER TO JEAN-PAUL SARTRE” THAT FRANÇOISE SAGAN HAD PUBLISHED IN THE PRESS THEY LUNCHED TOGETHER FROM TIME TO TIME. HE WAS QUITE FOND OF HER. HE TOOK PART IN THE FILM THAT JOSÉE DAYAN AND MALKA RIBOWSKA MADE OF ME AND THE ISSUE OF OBLIQUES DEVOTED TO HIM CAME OUT.

ON OCTOBER 28 HE RECEIVED A DELEGATION OF PEASANTS FROM THE LARZAC. THERE HAD BEEN SEVERAL ARTICLES IN LES TEMPS MODERNES ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLE. SARTRE WAS INTERESTED IN IT FOR SEVERAL REASONS: THEIR CONFRONTATION WITH THE STATE; THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE EXPANSION OF THE ARMY; THE DISCOVERY OF NEW TECHNIQUES OF RESISTANCE; AND THEIR ACTIVE NONVIOLENCE WHICH UTTERLY CONFUSED THE ESTABLISHED ORDER. HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TALK THESE THINGS OVER WITH THEM AT THE TIME OF THEIR WHITSUN MEETING IN 1976 BUT THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH HAD NOT ALLOWED HIM TO ATTEND.

IN OCTOBER 1978 SEVERAL OF THEM UNDERTOOK A HUNGER STRIKE AT SAINT SÉVERIN’S. SOME CAME TO ASK SARTRE TO BE PRESENT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THEY WERE TO HOLD THE NEXT DAY. HE WAS NOT WELL ENOUGH TO ACCEPT BUT HE WROTE A STATEMENT THAT WAS READ OUT TO THE JOURNALISTS DURING THE CONFERENCE. “YOU BELIEVE THAT FRANCE HAS TO BE DEFENDED BUT YOU DO NOT THINK IT RIGHT THAT THE ARMY SHOULD SETTLE DOWN IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY FAR FROM THE FRONTIERS AND THERE OVER THOUSANDS OF ACRES SET UP A ZONE OF EXTERMINATION BY NEW WEAPONS; NOR DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HIRE OUT THIS INHABITED STRETCH OF COUNTRY TO THE ARMIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES SO THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME AND EXERCISE THERE. YOU ARE RIGHT. TURNING THE LARZAC INTO THE WEIRD LOCUS OF A PREVENTIVE WORLD WAR AND THAT IN TIME OF DEEP PEACE CALLS FOR THE STUPIDITY AND THE CYNICISM OF THOSE WHO GOVERN US.”

AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME HE TALKED OVER A PLAN THAT GUILLAUMAT AN ACTOR FROM LYONS HAD SUBMITTED TO HIM—THE STAGING OF A WORK MISE EN THÉÂTRE THAT JEANNETTE COLOMBEL HAD PUT TOGETHER BASED ON HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL PASSAGES IN SARTRE. THE SHOW HAD A GREAT SUCCESS FIRST IN THE TWO MAIN THEATERS IN LYONS AND THEN FOR TWO YEARS ALL OVER FRANCE.

1979
SARTRE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFERENCE THAT TOOK PLACE IN MARCH UNDER THE AEGIS OF LES TEMPS MODERNES. VICTOR HAD CHERISHED THE NOTION EVER SINCE HIS JOURNEY WITH ELI BEN GAL; THEY OFTEN TELEPHONED ONE ANOTHER. ONE OF OUR OLD ISRAELI FRIENDS FLAPAN HAD OFFERED LES TEMPS MODERNES THE MINUTES OF AN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN COLLOQUY OVER WHICH HE HAD PRESIDED BUT HE ASKED FOR QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND THE DOCUMENT ADDED NOTHING NEW. VICTOR THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO ARRANGE A SIMILAR MEETING IN PARIS AND TO PUBLISH ITS RESULTS IN LES TEMPS MODERNES. THE EXPENSES WOULD NO DOUBT BE HIGH BUT GALLIMARD UNDERTOOK TO PAY THEM. OVER THE TELEPHONE VICTOR AND ELI DREW UP A LIST OF THOSE THEY HOPED WOULD ATTEND AND SENT OUT THE INVITATIONS. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE LIVED IN ISRAEL.

NUMBERS OF PRACTICAL PROBLEMS AROSE STARTING WITH WHERE THE MEETING SHOULD BE HELD LES TEMPS MODERNES’ OFFICE BEING A MERE RABBIT HUTCH. MICHEL FOUCAULT KINDLY LENT US HIS BIG VERY WELL-LIT QUIETLY AND ELEGANTLY FURNISHED APARTMENT. VICTOR RESERVED ACCOMMODATIONS IN A LITTLE LEFT-BANK HOTEL FOR A FEW DAYS AND A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN A NEARBY RESTAURANT. TABLES CHAIRS AND A TAPE RECORDER WERE SET UP IN FOUCAULT’S LIVING ROOM. IN SPITE OF A FEW TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THE FIRST MEETING WAS ABLE TO BE HELD ON MARCH 14. SARTRE OPENED THE PROCEEDINGS WITH A LITTLE SPEECH THAT HE AND VICTOR HAD AGREED UPON. APART FROM HIM CLAIRE ETCHERELLI AND ME—AND I DID NOT GO BACK THE NEXT DAY—NO MEMBERS OF THE TEMPS MODERNES TEAM WERE PRESENT. ALL OF THEM INCLUDING MYSELF LOOKED UPON VICTOR’S UNDERTAKING WITH MISTRUST.

THE MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE INTRODUCED THEMSELVES. A PALESTINIAN LIVING IN JERUSALEM IBRAHIM DAHKAK STATED THAT THIS DIALOGUE WAS MEANINGLESS. DID SARTRE NOT KNOW THAT IN ISRAEL PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS SAW ONE ANOTHER EVERY DAY AND TALKED TO EACH OTHER? SINCE NO EGYPTIANS OR NORTH AFRICANS HAD BEEN INVITED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIMPLER AND CHEAPER TO HOLD THE MEETING IN JERUSALEM. ELI BEN GAL AND VICTOR SAID THAT SOME OF THE PALESTINIANS PRESENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENTER ISRAEL. DAHKAK REPLIED THAT SOME PALESTINIANS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GO FROM. ISRAEL TO PARIS. AND HE WITHDREW FROM THE CONFERENCE. THE OTHER MEMBERS DID IN FACT ALL COME FROM ISRAEL EXCEPT FOR THE PALESTINIAN EDWARD SAÏD WHO TAUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND SHALIM SHARAF A PALESTINIAN TEACHER IN AUSTRIA. ONE OR TWO SPOKE GERMAN AND NEARLY ALL THE REST ENGLISH. THERE WERE VOLUNTARY TRANSLATORS. IF AN ISRAELI PREFERRED SPEAKING IN HEBREW ELI BEN GAL ACTED AS INTERPRETER. THE CONVERSATIONS WERE TAPE-RECORDED AND ARLETTE TYPED THEM. DURING THE SITTING CLAIRE ETCHERELLI AND CATHERINE VON BÜLOW PASSED AROUND COFFEE AND FRUIT JUICE WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM. APART FROM THE OFFICIAL SESSIONS THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS LUNCHED TOGETHER IN THE RESTAURANT VICTOR HAD CHOSEN. AT THESE TIMES THEY TALKED IN A MORE RELAXED FASHION. THEY EXPRESSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SURPRISE AT THE MODEST NATURE OF THEIR HOTEL BUT ABOVE ALL AT SARTRE’S NEAR-SILENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE ASSUMED BY VICTOR OF WHOM THEY KNEW NOTHING WHATSOEVER. A LITTLE FAIR-HAIRED RABBI ASKED FOR KOSHER FOOD. SCHMUEL TRIGANO A FRIEND OF LES TEMPS MODERNES TOOK HIM TO THE JEWISH RESTAURANT IN THE RUE MÉDICIS.

THE SPEECHES WERE MORE OR LESS INTERESTING MORE OR LESS TOUCHING BUT IN GENERAL IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME OLD STORY—THE PALESTINIANS WANTED A TERRITORY OF THEIR OWN AND THE ISRAELIS—ALL CHOSEN FROM THE LEFT—AGREED BUT THEY WANTED THEIR SECURITY GUARANTEED. IN ANY EVENT ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE INTELLECTUALS WHO POSSESSED NO KIND OF POWER AT ALL. VICTOR WAS NEVERTHELESS EXULTANT. “IT’S GOING TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL SCOOP” HE TOLD SARTRE. HE HAD TO EAT HIS WORDS. FOR VARIOUS REASONS THE ISSUE ENTITLED PEACE NOW AFTER AN ISRAELI PACIFIST MOVEMENT THAT DID NOT PLAY ANY GREAT PART IN POLITICS ONLY APPEARED IN OCTOBER AND IT FELL FLAT. DURING THE SUMMER OF 1980 EDWARD SAÏD WHOM VICTOR LOOKED UPON AS THE MEMBER OF THE CONFERENCE WITH THE GREATEST PRESTIGE TOLD SOME COMMON FRIENDS THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE HAD BEEN MADE TO COME FROM AMERICA. THE MEETING HAD SEEMED TO HIM A WRETCHED AFFAIR WHILE HE WAS ATTENDING IT AND EVEN WORSE WHEN HE READ THE PROCEEDINGS. BUT IN MARCH 1979 SARTRE SHARED VICTOR’S OPTIMISM AND I DID NOT TELL HIM ABOUT MY DOUBTS.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EASTER VACATION WE AND SYLVIE LEFT FOR THE SOUTH BY CAR. WE SLEPT AT VIENNE WHERE WE FOUND POINT’S RESTAURANT DISAPPOINTING. ON THE OTHER HAND REACHING AIX WAS A DELIGHT. THE HOTEL HALF A MILE OUT OF THE TOWN HAD A BIG GARDEN THAT SMELLED OF THE SUN AND PINE TREES AND FAR AWAY ONE COULD SEE THE WHITE RIDGE OF SAINTE-VICTOIRE SHARP AGAINST A PURE BLUE SKY. IT WAS STILL TOO COOL TO SIT OUT OF DOORS. WE READ IN SARTRE’S ROOM BUT OFTEN ALL THREE OF US WOULD GO FOR DRIVES LUNCHING AT SOME PLEASANT SPOT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

SHORTLY AFTER OUR RETURN TO PARIS SARTRE WAS SLIGHTLY WOUNDED BY A MAN WHO WAS HALF MAD GÉRARD DE CLÈVES. HE WAS A BELGIAN A POET AND THE PROTÉGÉ OF OUR FRIENDS LALLEMANT AND VERSTRAETEN. AT LONG INTERVALS BETWEEN STAYS IN THE ASYLUM HE WOULD COME TO PARIS AND THERE DAY AFTER DAY HE ASKED SARTRE FOR MONEY. DURING THIS LAST LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE ASYLUM SARTRE GAVE HIM SMALL SUMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT THEN TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE HIM AGAIN. CLÈVES NEVERTHELESS RETURNED. SARTRE WHO WAS AT HOME WITH ARLETTE REFUSED TO LET HIM IN BUT HE HELD THE DOOR AJAR WITH THE CHAIN STILL ON. AFTER A SHORT DISCUSSION CLÈVES TOOK A KNIFE FROM HIS POCKET AND STRUCK SARTRE’S HAND OVER THE CHAIN. THEN HE BEGAN BATTERING THE CLOSED DOOR SO VIOLENTLY THAT IN SPITE OF ITS ARMOR IT BEGAN TO YIELD. ARLETTE TELEPHONED THE POLICE AND AFTER A LONG CHASE IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE BUILDING CLÈVES WAS ARRESTED. SARTRE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY. HIS THUMB HAD BEEN SLASHED BUT FORTUNATELY NOT THE TENDON. FOR WEEKS IT WAS BANDAGED.

ON JUNE 20 HE TOOK PART IN THE “UN BATEAU POUR LE VIETNAM” COMMITTEE’S PRESS CONFERENCE. THIS COMMITTEE HAD ALREADY SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING OUT THE FIRST PART OF ITS UNDERTAKING. A SHIP THE ILE-DE-LUMIÈRE WAS ANCHORED OFF PULO-BIDONG AND IT HAD TAKEN IN A GREAT NUMBER OF REFUGEES. NOW THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO ESTABLISH AN AIRLIFT BETWEEN THE CAMPS IN MALAYSIA AND THAILAND AND THE TRANSIT CAMPS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES. FOR THIS THE PRESS HAD TO BE ALERTED. THE CONFERENCE WAS HELD IN THE ROOMS OF THE HOTEL LUTETIA. GLUCKSMANN WENT WITH SARTRE WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GREAT WHILE SHOOK HANDS WITH RAYMOND ARON. FOUCAULT SPOKE THEN DR. KOUCHNER WHO WORKED ABOARD THE ILE-DE-LUMIÈRE AND THEN SARTRE WHO LEFT A LITTLE BEFORE ARON’S SPEECH. ON JUNE 26 THEY WENT TO THE ELYSÉE TOGETHER TO ASK GISCARD TO INCREASE THE HELP GIVEN TO THE BOAT PEOPLE. THEY RECEIVED PROMISES THAT WERE MERE HOT AIR. SARTRE ATTRIBUTED NO IMPORTANCE TO THIS MEETING WITH ARON ALTHOUGH SOME JOURNALISTS WENT ON AND ON ABOUT IT.AX

THIS YEAR TOO THE SUMMER VACATION WAS A DELIGHTFUL PERIOD. AIX HAD SO PLEASED US IN THE SPRING THAT WE WENT BACK THERE IN AUGUST. THIS TIME WE HAD ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR WITH COMMUNICATING TERRACES THAT LOOKED STRAIGHT DOWN ONTO THE GARDEN. IT WAS HERE THAT WE USUALLY SAT TO READ AND TALK. SOMETIMES I WENT—BY TAXI SINCE IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID THAT SARTRE COULD NO LONGER WALK—TO LUNCH WITH HIM ON THE COURS MIRABEAU WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LIKED VERY MUCH. OR SYLVIE WOULD DRIVE US TO ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PLACES. NOW AND THEN WE SAW SMOKE FAR OFF—FOREST FIRES. SARTRE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS STAY. HE WAS PLEASED TOO WHEN SYLVIE WHO WAS GOING BACK TO PARIS DROVE US TO THE MARTIGUES AIRPORT WHERE WE TOOK THE PLANE FOR ROME. ONCE AGAIN WE HAD OUR OLD ROOMS LOOKING OUT OVER THE DAZZLING OR GHOSTLY WHITE OF SAINT PETER’S AND ONCE AGAIN WE RETURNED TO OUR OLD PEACEFUL HABITS. FROM TIME TO TIME SARTRE SAW AN AMERICAN GIRL WHO LIVED IN ROME AND WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE HE HAD RECENTLY MADE. WE BOTH MET ALICE SCHWARZER AND WE SAW CLAUDE COURCHAY WHO WAS STAYING IN THE CITY WITH A FRIEND CATHERINE RIHOIT. COURCHAY WAS AMAZED AT SARTRE’S GOOD HUMOR AND HIS CHEERFULNESS. HE DID NOT KNOW HIM WELL BUT HE HAD PICTURED HIM AS BEING MORE OR LESS BROKEN BY HIS ILLNESS AND HIS LACK OF SIGHT WHEREAS THERE BEFORE HIM WAS A MAN FILLED WITH THE JOY OF LIVING. WHEN SARTRE APPEARED IN PUBLIC HE USUALLY MADE A PAINFUL IMPRESSION. WRITING TO CLAUDE MAURIAC AFTER THE MEETING AT THE HOTEL LUTETIAAY RAYMOND ARON SAID IN EFFECT “I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING A DEAD MAN.” BUT IN PRIVATE LIFE THOSE WHO TALKED TO HIM WERE STRUCK BY HIS UNCONQUERABLE VITALITY.

HE AGREED TO GIVE M.-A. MACCIOCCHI AN INTERVIEW WHICH SHE PUBLISHED IN L’EUROPEO. HE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH IT.

SHORTLY BEFORE WE LEFT LILIANE SIEGEL TELEPHONED US FROM PARIS TO GIVE US THE NEWS OF GOLDMAN’S MURDER. I WAS OVERWHELMED. GOLDMAN ATTENDED THE TEMPS MODERNES MEETINGS WITH GREAT REGULARITY AND MY LIKING FOR HIM HAD CHANGED INTO A DEEP AFFECTION. I LIKED HIS INTELLIGENT IRONY HIS GAIETY HIS WARMTH. HE WAS FULL OF LIFE AND UNEXPECTED TURNS; HE WAS OFTEN FUNNY; HE WAS CONSTANT IN HIS ENMITIES AND HIS FRIENDSHIPS. THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN IN COLD BLOOD ADDED TO THE HORROR OF HIS DEATH. SARTRE WAS MOVED TOO BUT HE NOW LOOKED UPON EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED WITH DETACHMENT.

YET WHEN WE WERE BACK IN PARIS HE WISHED TO BE PRESENT AT GOLDMAN’S FUNERAL. CLAIRE ETCHERELLI DROVE US TO THE MORGUE IN HER LITTLE CAR. WE DID NOT GO IN BUT WE FOLLOWED THE HEARSE AS FAR AS THE ENTRANCE TO THE CEMETERY. HERE THERE WAS SUCH A CROWD THAT WE FOUND IT VERY HARD TO GET THROUGH ALTHOUGH PEOPLE RECOGNIZING SARTRE KINDLY MOVED ASIDE. CARS WERE NOT ALLOWED BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT. ETCHERELLI STAYED AT THE WHEEL WHILE SARTRE AND I SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY MADE OUR WAY THROUGH THE MASS OF PEOPLE. AFTER A FEW MOMENTS HE FELT EXHAUSTED. I WANTED HIM TO REST ON A GRAVE BUT SOMEONE BROUGHT A CHAIR. SARTRE SAT ON IT AND WE STAYED THERE FOR A WHILE SURROUNDED BY STRANGERS WHO STARED AND STARED. FORTUNATELY RENÉE SAUREI CAUGHT SIGHT OF US; HER CAR WAS DRAWN UP JUST BESIDE US. HAVING SENT SOMEONE TO TELL CLAIRE ETCHERELLI WE WERE LEAVING WE GOT INTO IT.

SARTRE RETURNED TO HIS WORK WITH VICTOR. I WAS RATHER WORRIED ABOUT IT. ON THREE SUCCESSIVE DAYS I ASKED HIM “HAS YOUR WORK GONE WELL?” ON THE FIRST HE SAID “NO. WE ARGUED THE WHOLE MORNING ABOUT … [SOME SUBJECT OR OTHER].” THE NEXT DAY HE REPLIED “NO. WE DON’T AGREE.” THE THIRD DAY HE SAID “WE HAVE MANAGED TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING.” I WAS AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT BE MAKING TOO MANY CONCESSIONS. I SHOULD VERY MUCH HAVE LIKED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS DIRECTLY BUT THEY WERE TAPED AND ARLETTE WHOSE JOB IT WAS TO DECIPHER AND TYPE THEM WORKED SLOWLY. NOTHING WAS QUITE READY YET SARTRE TOLD ME.

IN NOVEMBER HE GAVE CATHERINE CLÉMENT AN INTERVIEW FOR LE MATIN AND HE LUNCHED WITH THE PAPER’S TEAM. IN DECEMBER HE TOLD BERNARD DORT ABOUT HIS IDEAS ON THE THEATER. THE CONVERSATION APPEARED IN THE MAGAZINE TRAVAIL THÉÂTRAL AND IN THE COURSE OF IT HE SPOKE OF THE DRAMATISTS HE LIKED—PIRANDELLO BRECHT BECKETT—AND RECOUNTED THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN PLAYS. IN JANUARY 1980 HE PROTESTED AGAINST THE ORDER THAT CONFINED ANDREI SAKHAROV TO A GIVEN RESIDENCE AND HE SUPPORTED THE BOYCOTTING OF THE MOSCOW OLYMPIC GAMES. ON FEBRUARY 28 HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY LE GAI PIED A HOMOSEXUAL MONTHLY. AND HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CATHERINE CLÉMENT AND BERNARD PINGAUD FOR A COMING ISSUE OF L’ARC.

1980
ACCORDING TO A FRESH CHECKUP AT BROUSSAIS HOSPITAL ON FEBRUARY 4 HE WAS NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE. HE FOUND HIS ACTIVITIES INTERESTING HIS RELATIONS WITH YOUNG WOMEN AMUSING. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING LIFE WAS A JOY TO HIM. I REMEMBER ONE MORNING WHEN A BRILLIANT WINTER SUN FLOODED INTO HIS STUDY FULL ON HIS FACE. “OH THE SUN!” HE CRIED IN AN ECSTASY. WE PLANNED TO GO SYLVIE HE AND I TO BELLE-ILE FOR THE EASTER VACATION AND HE OFTEN SPOKE OF IT IN A HAPPY VOICE. HE WAS CAREFUL ENOUGH ABOUT HIS HEALTH TO MAINTAIN HIS GIVING UP OF TOBACCO. AND AS FAR AS I KNEW HE ONLY DRANK A VERY LITTLE. HE WAS SO SLOW WITH THE HALF BOTTLE OF CHABLIS HE ORDERED WHEN WE HAD LUNCH TOGETHER THAT HE LEFT AS MUCH AS HE DRANK.

YET ONE SUNDAY MORNING AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH ARLETTE FOUND HIM LYING ON HIS BEDROOM FLOOR WITH A TERRIBLE HANGOVER. WE LEARNED THAT HE GOT HIS VARIOUS YOUNG WOMEN WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE DANGER TO BRING HIM BOTTLES OF WHISKEY AND VODKA. HE HID THEM IN A CHEST OR BEHIND BOOKS. THAT SATURDAY EVENING—THE ONLY NIGHT HE HAD SPENT ALONE SINCE WANDA’S DEPARTURE—HE HAD GOT DRUNK. ARLETTE AND I EMPTIED THE HIDING PLACES I TELEPHONED THE YOUNG WOMEN ASKING THEM NOT TO BRING ANY MORE ALCOHOL AND I SCOLDED SARTRE VEHEMENTLY. IN FACT SINCE IT HAD NO IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES THIS OUTBREAK OBVIOUSLY DID NOT DAMAGE HIS HEALTH; BUT I WAS RATHER UNEASY ABOUT THE FUTURE. ABOVE ALL I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE RETURN OF THIS PASSION FOR DRINKING. IT DID NOT SQUARE WITH HIS APPARENT MENTAL BALANCE. HE PUT MY QUESTIONS ASIDE LAUGHING. “BUT YOU’RE FOND OF DRINKING TOO” HE SAID. PERHAPS HE WAS NOT BEARING THE SITUATION AS WELL AS HE DID BEFORE. IT IS NOT TRUE THAT “IN TIME YOU GET USED TO IT.”AZ FAR FROM HEALING WOUNDS TIME CAN ON THE CONTRARY MAKE THEM WORSE. LATER IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT WITHOUT CLEARLY ADMITTING IT EVEN TO HIMSELF HE CANNOT HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH HIS CONVERSATION WITH VICTOR NOW SOON TO COME OUT IN LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR.

I READ THIS CONVERSATION AT LAST—IT WAS SIGNED BY SARTRE AND BENNI LÉVI VICTOR’S REAL NAME—ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE IT WAS TO APPEAR. I WAS HORRIFIED. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE “PLURAL THOUGHT” THAT SARTRE HAD SPOKEN OF IN OBLIQUES. VICTOR DID NOT EXPRESS ANY OF HIS OWN OPINIONS DIRECTLY; HE MADE SARTRE ASSUME THEM WHILE HE BY VIRTUE OF WHO KNOWS WHAT REVEALED TRUTH PLAYED THE PART OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY. THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE TO SARTRE AND HIS ARROGANT SUPERIORITY UTTERLY DISGUSTED ALL THE FRIENDS WHO SAW THE DOCUMENT BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED. AND LIKE ME THEY WERE HORRIFIED BY THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENTS EXTORTED FROM SARTRE. IN FACT VICTOR HAD CHANGED A GREAT DEAL SINCE SARTRE FIRST MET HIM. LIKE MANY OTHER FORMER MAOISTS HE HAD TURNED TOWARD GOD—THE GOD OF ISRAEL SINCE HE WAS A JEW. HIS VIEW OF THE WORLD HAD BECOME SPIRITUALISTIC AND EVEN RELIGIOUS. SARTRE JIBBED AT THIS CHANGE OF DIRECTION. I REMEMBER ONE EVENING WHEN TALKING TO SYLVIE AND ME HE GAVE VENT TO HIS DISSATISFACTION. “VICTOR ABSOLUTELY INSISTS THAT THE WHOLE ORIGIN OF MORALS IS IN THE TORAH! BUT THAT’S NOT AT ALL WHAT I THINK” HE TOLD US. AND AS I HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT HE WOULD STRUGGLE WITH VICTOR FOR DAYS ON END AND THEN TIRED OF CONTENTION WOULD GIVE IN. VICTOR INSTEAD OF HELPING HIM TO BROADEN HIS OWN THOUGHT WAS BRINGING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON HIM SO THAT HE SHOULD REPUDIATE IT. HOW COULD HE DARE TO CLAIM THAT ANXIETY HAD BEEN NO MORE THAN A FASHION FOR SARTRE—FOR SARTRE WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF FASHIONS? HOW COULD HE SO WEAKEN THE NOTION OF FRATERNITY SO STRONG AND FIRM IN THE CRITIQUE OF DIALECTICAL REASON? I LET SARTRE KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF MY DISAPPOINTMENT. IT SURPRISED HIM. HE HAD EXPECTED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CRITICISM BUT NOT THIS RADICAL OPPOSITION. I TOLD HIM THAT THE WHOLE TEMPS MODERNES TEAM WAS WITH ME. BUT THIS ONLY MADE HIM THE MORE SET ON HAVING THE CONVERSATION PUBLISHED AT ONCE.

HOW CAN ONE EXPLAIN THIS “ABDUCTION OF AN OLD MAN”BA AS IT WAS PUT BY OLIVER TODD (WHO FOR HIS PART DID NOT RECOIL FROM THE ABDUCTION OF A DEAD ONE)?

SARTRE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO THINK AGAINST HIMSELF BUT HE NEVER DID SO IN ORDER TO SINK INTO MERE FACILITY. THIS VAGUE YIELDING PHILOSOPHY THAT VICTOR ATTRIBUTED TO HIM DID NOT SUIT SARTRE AT ALL.BB WHY DID HE CONCUR? HE WHO HAD NEVER BEEN OPEN TO ANY INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER WAS NOW SUBJECTED TO VICTOR’S. HE HAS TOLD US WHY BUT IT IS A REASON THAT HAS TO BE GONE INTO MORE DEEPLY. SARTRE HAD ALWAYS LIVED WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE FUTURE; HE COULD NOT LIVE OTHERWISE. NOW THAT HE WAS LIMITED TO THE PRESENT HE LOOKED UPON HIMSELF AS DEAD.BC OLD THREATENED IN HIS OWN BODY HALF-BLIND HE WAS SHUT OUT FROM THE FUTURE. HE THEREFORE TURNED TO A SUBSTITUTE—VICTOR A MILITANT AND A PHILOSOPHER WOULD BE THE “NEW INTELLECTUAL” OF WHOM SARTRE DREAMED AND WHOM HE WOULD HAVE HELPED TO BRING INTO EXISTENCE. TO DOUBT VICTOR WAS TO RENOUNCE THAT LIVING PROLONGATION OF HIMSELF MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM THAN THE PRAISE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. SO IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RESERVATIONS HE HAD ELECTED TO BELIEVE IN VICTOR. SARTRE DID HAVE IDEAS AND HE DID THINK; BUT HE THOUGHT SLOWLY. AND VICTOR HAD A GREAT FLOOD OF WORDS; HE STUNNED SARTRE AND HE DID NOT LEAVE HIM THE TIME HE NEEDED TO BRING THINGS INTO FOCUS. FINALLY SARTRE COULD NO LONGER READ. HE COULD NO LONGER REREAD WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN. THIS I BELIEVE WAS VERY IMPORTANT. I AM INCAPABLE OF JUDGING A TEXT THAT I HAVE NOT READ MYSELF. SARTRE WAS LIKE ME. YET HE HAD CHECKED THIS PIECE OF WRITING ONLY BY EAR. WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TO CONTATBD HE SAID “THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT FACTOR OF REFLEXIVE CRITICISM ALWAYS THERE WHEN YOU READ A TEXT YOURSELF IS NEVER VERY SHARPLY PRESENT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE IS READING IT ALOUD.” THEN AGAIN VICTOR WAS SUPPORTED BY ARLETTE WHO KNEW NOTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT SARTRE’S PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS AND WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH VICTOR’S NEW TENDENCIES—THEY WERE LEARNING HEBREW TOGETHER. SARTRE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THIS ALLIANCE AND HE LACKED THE PERSPECTIVE THAT ONLY A THOUGHTFUL SOLITARY READING COULD HAVE GIVEN HIM; SO HE GAVE WAY. ONCE THE CONVERSATION WAS PUBLISHED HE WAS SURPRISED AND HURT WHEN HE LEARNED THAT ALL THE SARTRIANS AND EVEN IN A MORE GENERAL MANNER ALL HIS FRIENDS SHARED MY CONSTERNATION.

ON WEDNESDAY MARCH 19 WE AND BOST SPENT AN AGREEABLE EVENING TOGETHER WITHOUT REFERRING TO THE QUESTION. JUST BEFORE HE WENT TO BED SARTRE ASKED ME “AT LES TEMPS MODERNES THIS MORNING DID ANYONE TALK ABOUT THE CONVERSATION?” I SAID NO WHICH WAS TRUE. HE SEEMED RATHER DISAPPOINTED. HE WOULD SO MUCH HAVE LIKED TO FIND SOME ALLIES! THE NEXT MORNING I WENT TO WAKE HIM AT NINE O’CLOCK. USUALLY WHEN I WENT INTO HIS ROOM HE WAS STILL DOZING; THIS TIME HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED GASPING ALMOST UNABLE TO SPEAK. ONCE WHEN ARLETTE WAS THERE HE HAD HAD WHAT HE CALLED “AN ATTACK OF AEROPHAGIA” BUT IT HAD PASSED OFF QUITE SOON. THIS ONE HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE FIVE IN THE MORNING AND HE HAD NOT HAD THE STRENGTH TO DRAG HIMSELF AS FAR AS MY DOOR AND KNOCK. I WAS FRIGHTENED; I TRIED TO TELEPHONE BUT THE SERVICE HAD BEEN CUT OFF PUIG HAVING LEFT THE BILL UNPAID. I THREW ON MY CLOTHES AND USED THE CONCIERGE’S TELEPHONE TO CALL A NEARBY DOCTOR WHO CAME AT ONCE. AS SOON AS HE HAD SEEN SARTRE HE TELEPHONED THE EMERGENCY SERVICE FROM A NEIGHBOR’S APARTMENT AND THEY ARRIVED IN FIVE MINUTES. SARTRE WAS BLED GIVEN AN INJECTION AND TREATMENT THAT LASTED FOR NEARLY AN HOUR. THEN HE WAS LAID ON A KIND OF WHEELED STRETCHER WHICH WAS ROLLED DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR; HE WAS BREATHING OXYGEN FROM A MASK THAT A DOCTOR HELD OVER HIS HEAD. THEY PUT HIM INTO AN ELEVATOR AND TOOK HIM TO AN AMBULANCE THAT WAS WAITING AT ONE OF THE ENTRANCES. IT WAS NOT YET KNOWN TO WHICH HOSPITAL HE WOULD BE TAKEN; THEY WOULD TELEPHONE THE CONCIERGE. I WENT UP TO HIS APARTMENT AGAIN TO WASH AND DRESS PROPERLY. NOW THAT HE WAS IN GOOD HANDS I THOUGHT THE ATTACK WOULD QUICKLY BE BROUGHT TO AN END. I DID NOT CANCEL MY LUNCH WITH DEN AND JEAN POUILLON. I NEVER IMAGINED WHEN I CLOSED THE APARTMENT DOOR BEHIND ME AS I SET OFF TO MEET THEM THAT IT WOULD NEVER OPEN FOR ME AGAIN.

STILL WHEN WE HAD HAD OUR LUNCH AND I TOOK A TAXI TO GO TO BROUSSAIS HOSPITAL—FOR I NOW KNEW THAT SARTRE WAS THERE—I ASKED POUILLON TO COME TOO AND WAIT FOR ME. “I’M RATHER AFRAID” I SAID TO HIM. SARTRE WAS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT BREATHING NORMALLY AND HE TOLD ME HE FELT WELL. I DID NOT STAY LONG. HE WAS DROWSY AND I DID NOT WANT TO KEEP POUILLON WAITING.

THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THAT SARTRE HAD A PULMONARY EDEMA WHICH WAS GIVING HIM A HIGH TEMPERATURE BUT WHICH WOULD SOON BE REABSORBED. HE WAS IN A BIG LIGHT-FILLED ROOM AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN THE SUBURBS. THE FEVER MADE HIM DELIRIOUS. THAT MORNING HE HAD SAID TO ARLETTE “YOU’RE DEAD TOO MY DEAR. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE BEING CREMATED? WELL HERE WE ARE BOTH OF US DEAD NOW.”BE WHEN I WAS THERE HE TOLD ME HE HAD JUST BEEN TO LUNCH AT HIS SECRETARY’S HOUSE NEAR PARIS. WHICH SECRETARY? HE NEVER USED THE WORD FOR EITHER VICTOR OR PUIG. HE CALLED THEM BY THEIR NAMES. AS I SEEMED SURPRISED HE EXPLAINED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD VERY KINDLY LENT HIM HIS CAR TO TAKE HIM THERE AND BRING HIM BACK. HE HAD PASSED THROUGH SOME VERY CURIOUS AND VERY AGREEABLE SUBURBS. HAD HE NOT DREAMED IT I ASKED HIM? HE SAID NO LOOKING CROSS SO I DID NOT PRESS THE POINT.

THE FEVER LESSENED DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED AND THE DELIRIUM STOPPED. THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN CAUSED BY A LACK OF IRRIGATION IN THE LUNGS THE ARTERIES NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. BUT NOW THE PULMONARY CIRCULATION WAS REESTABLISHED. WE HAD THOUGHT OF LEAVING FOR BELLE-ILE QUITE SOON AND SARTRE WAS DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA. “YES I SHALL LIKE BEING DOWN THERE; WE’LL BE ABLE TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS.” (ALL THIS WAS THE VICTOR CONVERSATION AND ITS REPERCUSSIONS.) AS HE WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO SEE ONE PERSON AT A TIME ARLETTE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL IN THE MORNING AND I IN THE AFTERNOON. I USED TO TELEPHONE AT ABOUT TEN TO ASK HOW HE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT AND THE REPLY WAS ALWAYS “VERY WELL.” HE SLEPT SOUNDLY AND ALSO DOZED A LITTLE AFTER LUNCH. WE TALKED ABOUT UNIMPORTANT MATTERS. HE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR FOR HIS MEALS AND WHEN I CAME TO SEE HIM. OTHERWISE HE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME LYING DOWN. HE HAD GROWN THINNER AND HE SEEMED WEAK BUT HIS SPIRITS WERE GOOD. HE LOOKED FORWARD TO LEAVING THE HOSPITAL BUT HE WAS ILL ENOUGH TO PUT UP WITH THE SITUATION CHEERFULLY. ARLETTE CAME BACK AT ABOUT SIX TO BE THERE WHEN HE HAD DINNER AND SOMETIMES SHE LEFT FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THAT VICTOR COULD COME IN.

PRESENTLY I ASKED DR. HOUSSET WHEN HE WOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE. HESITANTLY HE REPLIED “I CAN’T SAY … HE’S FRAIL VERY FRAIL.” AND TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER HE SAID THAT SARTRE WOULD HAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AGAIN. IT WAS ONLY IN THAT PART OF THE HOSPITAL THAT HE COULD BE WATCHED TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY SO THAT HE WOULD NOT RUN THE RISK OF ANY ACCIDENT. SARTRE DID NOT LIKE IT THERE. WHEN SYLVIE CAME TO SEE HIM HE SAID AS THOUGH HE WERE SPEAKING OF A HOTEL WHERE HE WAS STAYING FOR A HOLIDAY “I DON’T CARE FOR THIS PLACE. FORTUNATELY WE’LL BE LEAVING SOON. I LOVE THE IDEA OF GOING TO A LITTLE ISLAND.”

THERE WAS IN FACT NO LONGER ANY QUESTION OF GOING TO BELLE-ILE. I CANCELED THE ROOMS I HAD RESERVED. THE DOCTOR WANTED TO HAVE SARTRE WITHIN REACH IN CASE OF A FRESH ATTACK. BUT THEY DID BRING HIM BACK TO A ROOM BIGGER AND LIGHTER THAN THE FIRST. “THIS IS FINE” HE TOLD ME “BECAUSE NOW I’M QUITE NEAR HOME.” HE STILL HAD A VAGUE BELIEF THAT AT FIRST HE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL IN A SUBURB OF PARIS. HE SEEMED MORE AND MORE WEARY; HE BEGAN TO HAVE BEDSORES AND HIS BLADDER FUNCTIONED BADLY. THIS HAD TO BE DEALT WITH AND WHEN HE GOT UP—WHICH HAPPENED RARELY NOW—HE TRAILED A LITTLE PLASTIC BAG FULL OF URINE BEHIND HIM. FROM TIME TO TIME I LEFT HIS ROOM SO THAT A VISITOR MIGHT COME IN—BOST OR LANZMANN. WHEN I DID SO I WENT AND SAT IN A WAITING ROOM. IT WAS THERE THAT I OVERHEARD DR. HOUSSET AND ANOTHER DOCTOR TALKING AND THEY USED THE WORD “UREMIA.” I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR SARTRE AND I KNEW THAT UREMIA OFTEN BROUGHT HIDEOUS SUFFERING WITH IT; I BURST INTO TEARS AND FLUNG MYSELF INTO HOUSSET’S ARMS. “PROMISE ME THAT HE WON’T KNOW HE’S DYING THAT HE WON’T GO THROUGH ANY MENTAL ANGUISH THAT HE WON’T HAVE ANY PAIN!” “I PROMISE YOU THAT MADAME” HE SAID GRAVELY. A LITTLE LATER WHEN I HAD GONE BACK TO SARTRE’S ROOM HE CALLED ME. IN THE CORRIDOR HE SAID “I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MY PROMISE WAS NOT MERE WORDS. I SHALL KEEP IT.”

AFTERWARD THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE HIS KIDNEYS WERE NO LONGER ADEQUATELY SUPPLIED WITH BLOOD THEY NO LONGER FUNCTIONED. SARTRE STILL PASSED URINE BUT WITHOUT ELIMINATING UREA. AN OPERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED TO SAVE ONE KIDNEY BUT HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO BEAR IT; AND EVEN IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT THE INADEQUATE CIRCULATION WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE BRAIN BRINGING SENILE DECAY WITH IT. THE ONLY ANSWER WAS TO LET HIM DIE IN PEACE.

HE DID NOT SUFFER DURING THE FEW DAYS THAT FOLLOWED. “THERE’S JUST ONE RATHER DISAGREEABLE MOMENT” HE TOLD ME “AND THAT IS WHEN THEY DRESS MY BEDSORES IN THE MORNING. BUT THAT’S ALL.” THESE BEDSORES WERE HORRIFYING TO SEE (BUT FORTUNATELY THEY WERE HIDDEN FROM HIM)—GREAT PURPLISH-BLUE AND REDDENED PATCHES. IN FACT SINCE THE BLOOD DID NOT CIRCULATE PROPERLY GANGRENE HAD ATTACKED HIS FLESH.

HE SLEPT A GREAT DEAL BUT HE STILL SPOKE TO ME LUCIDLY. AT TIMES IT ALMOST SEEMED THAT HE HOPED TO GET WELL. POUILLON CAME TO SEE HIM DURING THE VERY LAST DAYS OF HIS ILLNESS; SARTRE ASKED HIM FOR A GLASS OF WATER SAYING CHEERFULLY “THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER IT’LL BE AT MY PLACE AND IT’LL BE WHISKEY!”BF BUT THE NEXT DAY HE ASKED ME “HOW ARE WE GOING TO MANAGE THE FUNERAL EXPENSES?” I PROTESTED OF COURSE AND BRANCHED OFF TO THE COST OF THE HOSPITAL ASSURING HIM THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY SERVICE WOULD LOOK AFTER IT. BUT I SAW THAT HE KNEW THE END WAS NEAR AND THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DID NOT OVERWHELM HIM. HIS ONLY ANXIETY WAS THE ONE THAT HAD TORMENTED HIM THESE LAST YEARS—THE LACK OF MONEY. HE DID NOT DWELL ON IT; DID NOT ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH. THE NEXT DAY WITH CLOSED EYES HE TOOK ME BY THE WRIST AND SAID “I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH MY DEAR CASTOR.” ON APRIL 14 HE WAS ASLEEP WHEN I CAME; HE WOKE AND SAID A FEW WORDS WITHOUT OPENING HIS EYES THEN HE HELD UP HIS LIPS TO ME. I KISSED HIS MOUTH AND HIS CHEEK. HE WENT BACK TO SLEEP. THESE WORDS AND THESE ACTIONS WERE UNUSUAL FOR HIM; THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY RELATED TO THE PROSPECT OF HIS DEATH.

SOME MONTHS LATER I MET DR. HOUSSET AS I HAD HOPED I SHOULD AND HE TOLD ME THAT SARTRE HAD SOMETIMES ASKED HIM QUESTIONS. “HOW WILL IT ALL END? WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?” BUT IT WAS NOT DEATH THAT MADE HIM UNEASY; IT WAS HIS BRAIN. HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT THE COMING OF DEATH BUT WITHOUT ANGUISH. HE WAS “RESIGNED” SAID HOUSSET OR RATHER CORRECTING HIMSELF “ASSURED.” NO DOUBT THE EUPHORIA-INDUCING MEDICINES THEY HAD GIVEN HIM CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PEACEFUL STATE OF MIND. BUT ABOVE ALL (EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST DAYS OF HIS HALF-BLINDNESS) HE HAD ALWAYS BORNE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WITH MODERATION AND CONSTANCY. HE DID NOT WISH TO TROUBLE OTHERS WITH WHAT TROUBLED HIM. AND REVOLT AGAINST A FATE HE COULD NOT ALTER SEEMED TO HIM POINTLESS. AS HE SAID TO CONTATBG “THAT’S JUST HOW THINGS ARE AND THERE’S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT SO I HAVE NO CALL TO BE WRETCHED.” HE STILL PASSIONATELY LOVED LIVING BUT HE WAS THOROUGHLY USED TO THE IDEA OF DEATH EVEN THOUGH HE PUSHED BACK ITS TIME UNTIL HE WOULD BE EIGHTY. HE ACCEPTED ITS COMING WITHOUT MAKING A FUSS APPRECIATIVE OF THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE AFFECTION THAT SURROUNDED HIM AND SATISFIED WITH HIS PAST. “I’VE DONE WHAT I HAD TO DO.”

HOUSSET ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE TROUBLES AND VEXATIONS THAT SARTRE HAD SUFFERED COULD IN NO WAY HAVE AFFECTED HIS CONDITION. A VIOLENT EMOTIONAL CRISIS MIGHT HAVE HAD DISASTROUS IMMEDIATE EFFECTS; BUT CARES AND WORRIES DILUTED IN TIME HAD NO INFLUENCE UPON WHAT MATTERED—THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. HE ADDED THAT ITS STATE MUST NECESSARILY HAVE GROWN WORSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. IN TWO YEARS AT THE OUTSIDE THE BRAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND SARTRE WOULD NO LONGER HAVE BEEN SARTRE.

ON THE MORNING OF TUESDAY APRIL 15 WHEN AS USUAL I ASKED WHETHER SARTRE HAD SLEPT WELL THE NURSE REPLIED “YES. BUT …” I HURRIED OVER AT ONCE. HE WAS ASLEEP AND BREATHING QUITE STRONGLY; HE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN A COMA AND HE HAD BEEN SINCE THE EVENING BEFORE. I STAYED THERE FOR HOURS WATCHING HIM. AT ABOUT SIX I MADE WAY FOR ARLETTE ASKING HER TO TELEPHONE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED. AT NINE THE TELEPHONE RANG. SHE SAID “IT’S OVER.” I CAME WITH SYLVIE. HE LOOKED JUST THE SAME; BUT HE NO LONGER BREATHED.

SYLVIE TOLD LANZMANN BOST POUILLON AND HORST. THEY CAME AT ONCE. WE WERE ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE ROOM UNTIL FIVE THE NEXT MORNING. I ASKED SYLVIE TO GO AND GET SOME WHISKEY AND WE DRANK IT AS WE TALKED ABOUT SARTRE’S LAST DAYS AND HIS EARLIER TIMES AND ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. SARTRE HAD OFTEN TOLD ME THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO BE BURIED AT THE PÈRE LACHAISE CEMETERY BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND STEPFATHER; HE WANTED TO BE CREMATED. WE DECIDED TO BURY HIM PROVISIONALLY IN THE MONTPARNASSE GRAVEYARD FROM WHICH HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE PÈRE LACHAISE FOR THE CREMATION; HIS ASHES WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK AND PLACED IN A PERMANENT TOMB IN THE MONTPARNASSE GRAVEYARD. WHILE WE WERE WATCHING OVER HIM JOURNALISTS BESIEGED THE BUILDING. BOST AND LANZMANN WENT OUT TO INSIST UPON THEIR GOING AWAY. THEY HID. BUT THEY DID NOT MANAGE TO GET IN. WHEN SARTRE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL THEY HAD ALSO TRIED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS; TWO OF THEM DRESSED AS MALE NURSES HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE ROOM BUT THEY HAD BEEN PUT OUT. THE NURSES TOOK CARE TO DRAW THE BLINDS AND TO PUT CURTAINS OVER THE DOORS TO PROTECT US. BUT STILL A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING SARTRE ASLEEP NO DOUBT TAKEN FROM A NEARBY ROOF DID APPEAR IN MATCH.

AT ONE POINT I ASKED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH SARTRE AND I MADE AS IF TO LIE DOWN BESIDE HIM UNDER THE SHEET. A NURSE STOPPED ME. “NO. TAKE CARE … THE GANGRENE.” IT WAS THEN THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE REAL NATURE OF THE BEDSORES. I LAY ON TOP OF THE SHEET AND I SLEPT A LITTLE. AT FIVE THE MALE NURSES CAME. THEY STRETCHED A SHEET AND A KIND OF COVER OVER SARTRE AND TOOK HIM AWAY.

I FINISHED THE NIGHT AT LANZMANN’S WHERE I ALSO SLEPT ON WEDNESDAY. FOR THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED I STAYED WITH SYLVIE WHERE I WAS BETTER PROTECTED FROM TELEPHONE CALLS AND JOURNALISTS THAN IN MY OWN APARTMENT. DURING THE DAY I SAW MY SISTER WHO HAD COME FROM ALSACE AND MY FRIENDS. I LOOKED AT THE PAPERS AND ALSO AT THE TELEGRAMS THAT CAME FLOODING IN AT ONCE. LANZMANN BOST AND SYLVIE TOOK CARE OF ALL THE FORMALITIES. AT FIRST THE FUNERAL WAS FIXED FOR FRIDAY BUT THEN IT WAS CHANGED TO SATURDAY SO THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD ATTEND. GISCARD D’ESTAING LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE KNEW SARTRE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED FOR A NATIONAL FUNERAL BUT THAT HE OFFERED TO PAY THE EXPENSES. WE REFUSED. HE MADE A POINT OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO SARTRE’S REMAINS.

ON FRIDAY I LUNCHED WITH BOST. I WANTED TO SEE SARTRE AGAIN BEFORE THE BURIAL AND WE WENT TO THE LECTURE THEATER OF THE HOSPITAL. SARTRE WAS BROUGHT IN HIS COFFIN DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES THAT SYLVIE HAD BROUGHT FOR HIM TO WEAR WHEN HE WENT TO THE OPERA. THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES IN MY APARTMENT AND SHE HAD NOT LIKED TO GO TO HIS TO FIND OTHERS. HE WAS CALM LIKE ALL DEAD PEOPLE AND LIKE MOST OF THEM EXPRESSIONLESS.

ON SATURDAY MORNING WE GATHERED IN THE LECTURE THEATER WHERE SARTRE WAS LAID OUT HIS FACE UNCOVERED STIFF AND COLD IN HIS FINE CLOTHES. AT MY REQUEST PINGAUD TOOK SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM. AFTER QUITE A LONG TIME THE MEN TURNED THE SHEET BACK OVER SARTRE’S FACE CLOSED THE COFFIN AND TOOK IT AWAY.

I GOT INTO THE HEARSE WITH SYLVIE MY SISTER AND ARLETTE. BEFORE US THERE WAS A CAR COVERED WITH SPLENDID SHEAVES OF FLOWERS AND WREATHS. A KIND OF MINIBUS CARRIED THOSE FRIENDS WHO WERE OLD OR UNABLE TO WALK FAR. A HUGE CROWD FOLLOWED—ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MOST OF THEM YOUNG. THERE WERE SOME WHO RAPPED ON THE HEARSE WINDOWS; THESE WERE USUALLY PHOTOGRAPHERS LEANING THEIR CAMERAS AGAINST THE GLASS TO TAKE ME UNAWARES. SOME OF THE FRIENDS OF LES TEMPS MODERNES FORMED A BARRIER BEHIND THE HEARSE AND ALL AROUND IT PEOPLE WE DID NOT KNOW SPONTANEOUSLY LINKED HANDS MAKING A CHAIN. ALL THE WAY THE CROWD WAS ORDERLY AND WARMLY SYMPATHETIC GENERALLY SPEAKING. “THIS IS THE LAST OF THE 1968 DEMONSTRATIONS” SAID LANZMANN. FOR MY PART I SAW NOTHING. I WAS MORE OR LESS ANESTHETIZED BY VALIUM AND BRACED TAUT IN MY DETERMINATION NOT TO COLLAPSE. I TOLD MYSELF THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY THE FUNERAL SARTRE HAD WANTED AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE HEARSE THE COFFIN WAS ALREADY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TOMB. I ASKED FOR A CHAIR AND I SAT THERE AT THE EDGE OF THE OPEN GRAVE MY MIND A BLANK. I SAW PEOPLE WHO HAD CLIMBED ONTO WALLS ONTO TOMBS; A VAGUE SWARMING MASS. I STOOD UP TO GO BACK TO THE CAR. IT WAS ONLY TEN YARDS AWAY BUT THE CROWD WAS SO DENSE THAT I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE SMOTHERED. THEN THERE I WAS AT LANZMANN’S HOUSE AGAIN WITH FRIENDS WHO HAD COME STRAGGLING BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD. I RESTED FOR A WHILE AND THEN AS WE DID NOT WISH TO SEPARATE WE HAD DINNER TOGETHER AT ZEYER’S IN A PRIVATE ROOM. I REMEMBER NOTHING ABOUT IT. APPARENTLY I DRANK A GREAT DEAL AND HAD TO BE ALMOST CARRIED DOWN THE STAIRS. GEORGES MICHEL TOOK ME BACK TO MY APARTMENT.

I SPENT THE NEXT THREE DAYS AT SYLVIE’S. ON WEDNESDAY MORNING THERE WAS THE CREMATION AT THE PÈRE LACHAISE AND I WAS TOO EXHAUSTED TO GO. I SLEPT AND—I CANNOT TELL HOW—I FELL OUT OF BED AND REMAINED THERE IN A SITTING POSITION ON THE CARPET. WHEN SYLVIE AND LANZMANN CAME BACK FROM THE CREMATION AND FOUND ME I WAS DELIRIOUS. THEY TOOK ME TO A HOSPITAL. I HAD PNEUMONIA. I GOT OVER IT IN TWO WEEKS.

SARTRE’S ASHES WERE BROUGHT TO THE MONTPARNASSE CEMETERY. EVERY DAY UNKNOWN HANDS LAY LITTLE BUNCHES OF FRESH FLOWERS ON HIS GRAVE.

THERE IS ONE QUESTION THAT I HAVE NOT ASKED MYSELF I ADMIT. IT WILL PERHAPS OCCUR TO THE READER. SHOULD I NOT HAVE WARNED SARTRE OF THE IMMINENCE OF HIS DEATH? WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WEAKENED AND WITHOUT RESILIENCE ALL I THOUGHT OF WAS HIDING THE GRAVITY OF HIS CONDITION FROM HIM. BUT BEFORE THAT? HE HAD ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT IN THE EVENT OF CANCER OR ANY OTHER INCURABLE DISEASE HE WANTED TO KNOW. YET HIS WAS AN AMBIGUOUS CASE. HE WAS “IN DANGER” BUT WOULD HE HOLD OUT ANOTHER TEN YEARS AS HE HAD WISHED OR WOULD EVERYTHING BE OVER IN A YEAR OR TWO? NOBODY KNEW. HE HAD NO ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE; HE COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF. AND HE LOVED LIVING. HE HAD ALREADY FOUND IT HARD ENOUGH TO ACCEPT HIS BLINDNESS AND HIS INFIRMITIES. IF HE HAD BEEN MORE EXACTLY AWARE OF THE THREAT THAT HUNG OVER HIM IT WOULD ONLY HAVE DARKENED HIS LAST YEARS WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD. IN ANY CASE LIKE HIM I WAVERED BETWEEN DREAD AND HOPE. MY SILENCE DID NOT SEPARATE US.

HIS DEATH DOES SEPARATE US. MY DEATH WILL NOT BRING US TOGETHER AGAIN. THAT IS HOW THINGS ARE. IT IS IN ITSELF SPLENDID THAT WE WERE ABLE TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN HARMONY FOR SO LONG.

(THE FRENCH EMPLOYERS’ ORGANIZATION [TRANS.]) TO PROTEST AGAINST THE DEATH OF FIVE IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN ASPHYXIATED BY GAS. THE C.R.S. (A SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE POLICE OFTEN USED FOR DEALING WITH RIOTS [TRANS.]) HAD KNOCKED THEM ABOUT ARRESTED THEM AND THEN LET THEM GO ALL EXCEPT CASTRO WHO JUMPED OUT OF THE POLICE VAN AT A RED LIGHT AND TRIED TO RUN AWAY.

ACT I
A NUMBER OF PATRICIANS ONE A VERY OLD MAN ARE GATHERED IN A STATE ROOM OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE. THEY ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS.


FIRST PATRICIAN: STILL NO NEWS.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: NONE LAST NIGHT NONE THIS MORNING.

SECOND PATRICIAN: THREE DAYS WITHOUT NEWS. STRANGE INDEED!

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OUR MESSENGERS GO OUT OUR MESSENGERS RETURN. AND ALWAYS THEY SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY: “NOTHING.”

SECOND PATRICIAN: THEY’VE COMBED THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE. WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE?

FIRST PATRICIAN: WE CAN ONLY WAIT. IT’S NO USE MEETING TROUBLE HALFWAY. PERHAPS HE’LL RETURN AS ABRUPTLY AS HE LEFT US.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WHEN I SAW HIM LEAVING THE PALACE I NOTICED A QUEER LOOK IN HIS EYES.

FIRST PATRICIAN: YES SO DID I. IN FACT I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS AMISS.

SECOND PATRICIAN: DID HE ANSWER?

FIRST PATRICIAN: ONE WORD: “NOTHING.”

[A SHORT SILENCE. HELICON ENTERS. HE IS MUNCHING ONIONS.]

SECOND PATRICIAN [IN THE SAME NERVOUS TONE]: IT’S ALL VERY PERTURBING.

FIRST PATRICIAN: OH COME NOW! ALL YOUNG FELLOWS ARE LIKE THAT.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YOU’RE RIGHT THERE. THEY TAKE THINGS HARD. BUT TIME SMOOTHS EVERYTHING OUT.

SECOND PATRICIAN: DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OF COURSE. FOR ONE GIRL DEAD A DOZEN LIVING ONES.

HELICON: AH? SO YOU THINK THAT THERE’S A GIRL BEHIND IT?

FIRST PATRICIAN: WHAT ELSE SHOULD THERE BE? ANYHOW—THANK GOODNESS!—GRIEF NEVER LASTS FOREVER. IS ANY ONE OF US HERE CAPABLE OF MOURNING A LOSS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR ON END?

SECOND PATRICIAN: NOT I ANYHOW.

FIRST PATRICIAN: NO ONE CAN DO THAT.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: LIFE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE IF ONE COULD.

FIRST PATRICIAN: QUITE SO. TAKE MY CASE. I LOST MY WIFE LAST YEAR. I SHED MANY TEARS AND THEN I FORGOT. EVEN NOW I FEEL A PANG OF GRIEF AT TIMES. BUT HAPPILY IT DOESN’T AMOUNT TO MUCH.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YES NATURE’S A GREAT HEALER.

[CHEREA ENTERS.]

FIRST PATRICIAN: WELL …?

CHEREA: STILL NOTHING.

HELICON: COME GENTLEMEN! THERE’S NO NEED FOR CONSTERNATION.

FIRST PATRICIAN: I AGREE.

HELICON: WORRYING WON’T MEND MATTERS—AND IT’S LUNCHTIME.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: THAT’S SO. WE MUSTN’T DROP THE PREY FOR THE SHADOW.

CHEREA: I DON’T LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS. BUT ALL WAS GOING TOO SMOOTHLY. AS AN EMPEROR HE WAS PERFECTION’S SELF.

SECOND PATRICIAN: YES EXACTLY THE EMPEROR WE WANTED; CONSCIENTIOUS AND INEXPERIENCED.

FIRST PATRICIAN: BUT WHAT’S COME OVER YOU? THERE’S NO REASON FOR ALL THESE LAMENTATIONS. WE’VE NO GROUND FOR ASSUMING HE WILL CHANGE. LET’S SAY HE LOVED DRUSILLA. ONLY NATURAL; SHE WAS HIS SISTER. OR SAY HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN BROTHERLY; SHOCKING ENOUGH I GRANT YOU. BUT IT’S REALLY GOING TOO FAR SETTING ALL ROME IN A TURMOIL BECAUSE THE GIRL HAS DIED.

CHEREA: MAYBE. BUT AS I SAID I DON’T LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS; THIS ESCAPADE ALARMS ME.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YES THERE’S NEVER SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE.

FIRST PATRICIAN: IN ANY CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE SHOULD PREVENT HIS MAKING A PUBLIC TRAGEDY OF … OF LET’S SAY A REGRETTABLE ATTACHMENT. NO DOUBT SUCH THINGS HAPPEN; BUT THE LESS SAID THE BETTER.

HELICON: HOW CAN YOU BE SURE DRUSILLA IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE?

SECOND PATRICIAN: WHO ELSE SHOULD IT BE?

HELICON: NOBODY AT ALL QUITE LIKELY. WHEN THERE’S A HOST OF EXPLANATIONS TO CHOOSE FROM WHY PICK ON THE STUPIDEST MOST OBVIOUS ONE?

[YOUNG SCIPIO ENTERS. CHEREA GOES TOWARD HIM.]

CHEREA: WELL?

SCIPIO: STILL NOTHING. EXCEPT THAT SOME PEASANTS THINK THEY SAW HIM LAST NIGHT NOT FAR FROM ROME RUSHING THROUGH THE STORM.

[CHEREA COMES BACK TO THE PATRICIANS SCIPIO FOLLOWING HIM.]

CHEREA: THAT MAKES THREE DAYS SCIPIO DOESN’T IT?

SCIPIO: YES … I WAS THERE FOLLOWING HIM AS I USUALLY DO. HE WENT UP TO DRUSILLA’S BODY. HE STROKED IT WITH TWO FINGERS AND SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A LONG WHILE. THEN HE SWUNG ROUND AND WALKED OUT CALMLY ENOUGH.… AND EVER SINCE WE’VE BEEN HUNTING FOR HIM—IN VAIN.

CHEREA [SHAKING HIS HEAD]: THAT YOUNG MAN WAS TOO FOND OF LITERATURE.

SECOND PATRICIAN: OH AT HIS AGE YOU KNOW …

CHEREA: AT HIS AGE PERHAPS; BUT NOT IN HIS POSITION. AN ARTISTIC EMPEROR IS AN ANOMALY. I GRANT YOU WE’VE HAD ONE OR TWO; MISFITS HAPPEN IN THE BEST OF EMPIRES. BUT THE OTHERS HAD THE GOOD TASTE TO REMEMBER THEY WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS.

FIRST PATRICIAN: IT MADE THINGS RUN MORE SMOOTHLY.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: ONE MAN ONE JOB—THAT’S HOW IT SHOULD BE.

SCIPIO: WHAT CAN WE DO CHEREA?

CHEREA: NOTHING.

SECOND PATRICIAN: WE CAN ONLY WAIT. IF HE DOESN’T RETURN A SUCCESSOR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND. BETWEEN OURSELVES—THERE’S NO SHORTAGE OF CANDIDATES.

FIRST PATRICIAN: NO BUT THERE’S A SHORTAGE OF THE RIGHT SORT.

CHEREA: SUPPOSE HE COMES BACK IN AN UGLY MOOD?

FIRST PATRICIAN: OH HE’S A MERE BOY; WE’LL MAKE HIM SEE REASON.

CHEREA: AND WHAT IF HE DECLINES TO SEE IT?

FIRST PATRICIAN [LAUGHING]: IN THAT CASE MY FRIEND DON’T FORGET I ONCE WROTE A MANUAL OF REVOLUTIONS. YOU’LL FIND ALL THE RULES THERE.

CHEREA: I’LL LOOK IT UP—IF THINGS COME TO THAT. BUT I’D RATHER BE LEFT TO MY BOOKS.

SCIPIO: IF YOU’LL EXCUSE ME.…

[GOES OUT.]

CHEREA: HE’S OFFENDED.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: SCIPIO IS YOUNG AND YOUNG PEOPLE ALWAYS HANG TOGETHER.

HELICON: SCIPIO DOESN’T COUNT ANYHOW.

[ENTER A MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL BODYGUARD.]

THE GUARDSMAN: CALIGULA HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE PALACE GARDENS.

[ALL LEAVE THE ROOM. THE STAGE IS EMPTY FOR SOME MOMENTS. THEN CALIGULA ENTERS STEALTHILY FROM THE LEFT. HIS LEGS ARE CAKED WITH MUD HIS GARMENTS DIRTY; HIS HAIR IS WET HIS LOOK DISTRAUGHT. HE BRINGS HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH SEVERAL TIMES. THEN HE APPROACHES A MIRROR STOPPING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE CATCHES SIGHT OF HIS REFLECTED SELF. AFTER MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS HE SITS DOWN ON THE RIGHT LETTING HIS ARMS HANG LIMP BETWEEN HIS KNEES. HELICON ENTERS LEFT. ON SEEING CALIGULA HE STOPS AT THE FAR END OF THE STAGE AND CONTEMPLATES HIM IN SILENCE. CALIGULA TURNS AND SEES HIM. A SHORT SILENCE.]

HELICON [ACROSS THE STAGE]: GOOD MORNING CAIUS.

CALIGULA [IN QUITE AN ORDINARY TONE]: GOOD MORNING HELICON.

[A SHORT SILENCE.]

HELICON: YOU’RE LOOKING TIRED.

CALIGULA: I’VE WALKED A LOT.

HELICON: YES YOU’VE BEEN AWAY FOR QUITE A WHILE.

[ANOTHER SHORT SILENCE.]

CALIGULA: IT WAS HARD TO FIND.

HELICON: WHAT WAS HARD TO FIND?

CALIGULA: WHAT I WAS AFTER.

HELICON: MEANING?

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME MATTER-OF-FACT TONE]: THE MOON.

HELICON: WHAT?

CALIGULA: YES I WANTED THE MOON.

HELICON: AH.… [ANOTHER SILENCE. HELICON APPROACHES CALIGULA.] AND WHY DID YOU WANT IT?

CALIGULA: WELL … IT’S ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVEN’T GOT.

HELICON: I SEE. AND NOW—HAVE YOU FIXED IT UP TO YOUR SATISFACTION?

CALIGULA: NO. I COULDN’T GET IT.

HELICON: TOO BAD!

CALIGULA: YES AND THAT’S WHY I’M TIRED. [PAUSES. THEN] HELICON!

HELICON: YES CAIUS?

CALIGULA: NO DOUBT YOU THINK I’M CRAZY.

HELICON: AS YOU KNOW WELL I NEVER THINK.

CALIGULA: AH YES.… NOW LISTEN! I’M NOT MAD; IN FACT I’VE NEVER FELT SO LUCID. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS QUITE SIMPLE; I SUDDENLY FELT A DESIRE FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE. THAT’S ALL. [PAUSES.] THINGS AS THEY ARE IN MY OPINION ARE FAR FROM SATISFACTORY.

HELICON: MANY PEOPLE SHARE YOUR OPINION.

CALIGULA: THAT IS SO. BUT IN THE PAST I DIDN’T REALIZE IT. NOW I KNOW. [STILL IN THE SAME MATTER-OF-FACT TONE] REALLY THIS WORLD OF OURS THE SCHEME OF THINGS AS THEY CALL IT IS QUITE INTOLERABLE. THAT’S WHY I WANT THE MOON OR HAPPINESS OR ETERNAL LIFE—SOMETHING IN FACT THAT MAY SOUND CRAZY BUT WHICH ISN’T OF THIS WORLD.

HELICON: THAT’S SOUND ENOUGH IN THEORY. ONLY IN PRACTICE ONE CAN’T CARRY IT THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION.

CALIGULA [RISING TO HIS FEET BUT STILL WITH PERFECT CALMNESS]: YOU’RE WRONG THERE. IT’S JUST BECAUSE NO ONE DARES TO FOLLOW UP HIS IDEAS TO THE END THAT NOTHING IS ACHIEVED. ALL THAT’S NEEDED I SHOULD SAY IS TO BE LOGICAL RIGHT THROUGH AT ALL COSTS. [HE STUDIES HELICON’S FACE.] I CAN SEE TOO WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. WHAT A FUSS OVER A WOMAN’S DEATH! BUT THAT’S NOT IT. TRUE ENOUGH I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT A WOMAN DIED SOME DAYS AGO; A WOMAN WHOM I LOVED. BUT LOVE WHAT IS IT? A SIDE ISSUE. AND I SWEAR TO YOU HER DEATH IS NOT THE POINT; IT’S NO MORE THAN THE SYMBOL OF A TRUTH THAT MAKES THE MOON ESSENTIAL TO ME. A CHILDISHLY SIMPLE OBVIOUS ALMOST SILLY TRUTH BUT ONE THAT’S HARD TO COME BY AND HEAVY TO ENDURE.

HELICON: MAY I KNOW WHAT IT IS THIS TRUTH THAT YOU’VE DISCOVERED?

CALIGULA [HIS EYES AVERTED IN A TONELESS VOICE]: MEN DIE; AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY.

HELICON [AFTER A SHORT PAUSE]: ANYHOW CALIGULA IT’S A TRUTH WITH WHICH ONE COMES TO TERMS WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE. ONLY LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OVER THERE. THIS TRUTH OF YOURS DOESN’T PREVENT THEM FROM ENJOYING THEIR MEAL.

CALIGULA [WTH SUDDEN VIOLENCE]: ALL IT PROVES IS THAT I’M SURROUNDED BY LIES AND SELF-DECEPTION. BUT I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT; I WISH MEN TO LIVE BY THE LIGHT OF TRUTH. AND I’VE THE POWER TO MAKE THEM DO SO. FOR I KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND HAVEN’T GOT. THEY’RE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING AND THEY NEED A TEACHER; SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT.

HELICON: DON’T TAKE OFFENSE CAIUS IF I GIVE YOU A WORD OF ADVICE.… BUT THAT CAN WAIT. FIRST YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME REST.

CALIGULA [SITTING DOWN. HIS VOICE IS GENTLE AGAIN]: THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE HELICON. I SHALL NEVER REST AGAIN.

HELICON: BUT—WHY?

CALIGULA: IF I SLEEP WHO’LL GIVE ME THE MOON?

HELICON [AFTER A SHORT SILENCE]: THAT’S TRUE.

CALIGULA [RISING TO HIS FEET AGAIN WITH AN EFFORT]: LISTEN HELICON … I HEAR FOOTSTEPS VOICES. SAY NOTHING—AND FORGET YOU’VE SEEN ME.

HELICON: I UNDERSTAND.

CALIGULA [LOOKING BACK AS HE MOVES TOWARD THE DOOR]: AND PLEASE HELP ME FROM NOW ON.

HELICON: I’VE NO REASON NOT TO DO SO CAIUS. BUT I KNOW VERY FEW THINGS AND FEW THINGS INTEREST ME. IN WHAT WAY CAN I HELP YOU?

CALIGULA: IN THE WAY OF … THE IMPOSSIBLE.

HELICON: I’LL DO MY BEST.

[CALIGULA GOES OUT. SCIPIO AND CÆSONIA ENTER HURRIEDLY.]

SCIPIO: NO ONE! HAVEN’T YOU SEEN HIM?

HELICON: NO.

CÆSONIA: TELL ME HELICON. ARE YOU QUITE SURE HE DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING TO YOU BEFORE HE WENT AWAY?

HELICON: I’M NOT A SHARER OF HIS SECRETS I’M HIS PUBLIC. A MERE ONLOOKER. IT’S MORE PRUDENT.

CÆSONIA: PLEASE DON’T TALK LIKE THAT.

HELICON: MY DEAR CÆSONIA CAIUS IS AN IDEALIST AS WE ALL KNOW. HE FOLLOWS HIS BENT AND NO ONE CAN FORESEE WHERE IT WILL TAKE HIM.… BUT IF YOU’LL EXCUSE ME I’LL GO TO LUNCH.

[EXIT HELICON.]

CÆSONIA [SINKING WEARILY ONTO A DIVAN]: ONE OF THE PALACE GUARDS SAW HIM GO BY. BUT ALL ROME SEES CALIGULA EVERYWHERE. AND CALIGULA OF COURSE SEES NOTHING BUT HIS OWN IDEA.

SCIPIO: WHAT IDEA?

CÆSONIA: HOW CAN I TELL SCIPIO?

SCIPIO: ARE YOU THINKING OF DRUSILLA?

CÆSONIA: PERHAPS. ONE THING IS SURE; HE LOVED HER. AND IT’S A CRUEL THING TO HAVE SOMEONE DIE TODAY WHOM ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE HOLDING IN YOUR ARMS.

SCIPIO [TIMIDLY]: AND YOU …?

CÆSONIA: OH I’M THE OLD TRUSTED MISTRESS. THAT’S MY ROLE.

SCIPIO: CÆSONIA WE MUST SAVE HIM.

CÆSONIA: SO YOU TOO LOVE HIM?

SCIPIO: YES. HE’S BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME. HE ENCOURAGED ME; I SHALL NEVER FORGET SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID. HE TOLD ME LIFE ISN’T EASY BUT IT HAS CONSOLATIONS: RELIGION ART AND THE LOVE ONE INSPIRES IN OTHERS. HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY MISTAKE ONE MAKES IN LIFE IS TO CAUSE OTHERS SUFFERING. HE TRIED TO BE A JUST MAN.

CÆSONIA [RISING]: HE’S ONLY A CHILD. [SHE GOES TO THE GLASS AND SCANS HERSELF.] THE ONLY GOD I’VE EVER HAD IS MY BODY AND NOW I SHALL PRAY THIS GOD OF MINE TO GIVE CAIUS BACK TO ME.

[CALIGULA ENTERS. ON SEEING CÆSONIA AND SCIPIO HE HESITATES AND TAKES A BACKWARD STEP. AT THE SAME MOMENT SEVERAL MEN ENTER FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM: PATRICIANS AND THE INTENDANT OF THE PALACE. THEY STOP SHORT WHEN THEY SEE CALIGULA. CÆSONIA TURNS. SHE AND SCIPIO HURRY TOWARD CALIGULA WHO CHECKS THEM WITH A GESTURE.]

INTENDANT [IN A RATHER QUAVERING VOICE]: WE … WE’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU CÆSAR HIGH AND LOW.

CALIGULA [IN A CHANGED HARSH TONE]: SO I SEE.

INTENDANT: WE … I MEAN …

CALIGULA [ROUGHLY]: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

INTENDANT: WE WERE FEELING ANXIOUS CÆSAR.

CALIGULA [GOING TOWARD HIM]: WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO FEEL ANXIOUS?

INTENDANT: WELL … ER … [HE HAS AN INSPIRATION.] WELL AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE POINTS TO BE SETTLED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREASURY.

CALIGULA [BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER]: AH YES. THE TREASURY! THAT’S SO. THE TREASURY’S OF PRIME IMPORTANCE.

INTENDANT: YES INDEED.

CALIGULA [STILL LAUGHING TO CÆSONIA]: DON’T YOU AGREE MY DEAR? THE TREASURY IS ALL-IMPORTANT.

CÆSONIA: NO CALIGULA. IT’S A SECONDARY MATTER.

CALIGULA: THAT ONLY SHOWS YOUR IGNORANCE. WE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN OUR TREASURY. EVERYTHING’S IMPORTANT: OUR FISCAL SYSTEM PUBLIC MORALS FOREIGN POLICY ARMY EQUIPMENT AND AGRARIAN LAWS. EVERYTHING’S OF CARDINAL IMPORTANCE I ASSURE YOU. AND EVERYTHING’S ON AN EQUAL FOOTING: THE GRANDEUR OF ROME AND YOUR ATTACKS OF ARTHRITIS.… WELL WELL I’M GOING TO APPLY MY MIND TO ALL THAT. AND TO BEGIN WITH … NOW LISTEN WELL INTENDANT.

INTENDANT: WE ARE LISTENING SIR.

[THE PATRICIANS COME FORWARD.]

CALIGULA: YOU’RE OUR LOYAL SUBJECTS ARE YOU NOT?

INTENDANT [IN A REPROACHFUL TONE]: OH CÆSAR …!

CALIGULA: WELL I’VE SOMETHING TO PROPOSE TO YOU. WE’RE GOING TO MAKE A COMPLETE CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IN TWO MOVES. DRASTIC AND ABRUPT. I’LL EXPLAIN INTENDANT … WHEN THE PATRICIANS HAVE LEFT. [THE PATRICIANS GO OUT. CALIGULA SEATS HIMSELF BESIDE CÆSONIA WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST.] NOW MARK MY WORDS. THE FIRST MOVE’S THIS. EVERY PATRICIAN EVERYONE IN THE EMPIRE WHO HAS ANY CAPITAL—SMALL OR LARGE IT’S ALL THE SAME THING—IS ORDERED TO DISINHERIT HIS CHILDREN AND MAKE A NEW WILL LEAVING HIS MONEY TO THE STATE.

INTENDANT: BUT CÆSAR …

CALIGULA: I’VE NOT YET GIVEN YOU LEAVE TO SPEAK. AS THE NEED ARISES WE SHALL HAVE THESE PEOPLE DIE; A LIST WILL BE DRAWN UP BY US FIXING THE ORDER OF THEIR DEATHS. WHEN THE FANCY TAKES US WE MAY MODIFY THAT ORDER. AND OF COURSE WE SHALL STEP INTO THEIR MONEY.

CÆSONIA [FREEING HERSELF]: BUT—WHAT’S COME OVER YOU?

CALIGULA [IMPERTURBABLY]: OBVIOUSLY THE ORDER OF THEIR GOING HAS NO IMPORTANCE. OR RATHER ALL THESE EXECUTIONS HAVE AN EQUAL IMPORTANCE—FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT NONE HAS ANY. REALLY ALL THOSE FELLOWS ARE ON A PAR ONE’S AS GUILTY AS ANOTHER. [TO THE INTENDANT PEREMPTORILY] YOU ARE TO PROMULGATE THIS EDICT WITHOUT A MOMENT’S DELAY AND SEE IT’S CARRIED OUT FORTHWITH. THE WILLS ARE TO BE SIGNED BY RESIDENTS IN ROME THIS EVENING; WITHIN A MONTH AT THE LATEST BY PERSONS IN THE PROVINCES. SEND OUT YOUR MESSENGERS.

INTENDANT: CÆSAR I WONDER IF YOU REALIZE …

CALIGULA: DO I REALIZE …? NOW LISTEN WELL YOU FOOL! IF THE TREASURY HAS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE HUMAN LIFE HAS NONE. THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO YOU. PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE YOU ARE BOUND TO ADMIT THE LOGIC OF MY EDICT AND SINCE MONEY IS THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS SHOULD SET NO VALUE ON THEIR LIVES OR ANYONE ELSE’S. I HAVE RESOLVED TO BE LOGICAL AND I HAVE THE POWER TO ENFORCE MY WILL. PRESENTLY YOU’LL SEE WHAT LOGIC’S GOING TO COST YOU? I SHALL ELIMINATE CONTRADICTIONS AND CONTRADICTERS. IF NECESSARY I’LL BEGIN WITH YOU.

INTENDANT: CÆSAR MY GOOD WILL CAN BE RELIED ON THAT I SWEAR.

CALIGULA: AND MINE TOO; THAT I GUARANTEE. JUST SEE HOW READY I AM TO ADOPT YOUR POINT OF VIEW AND GIVE THE TREASURY THE FIRST PLACE IN MY PROGRAM. REALLY YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO ME; I’M PLAYING INTO YOUR HAND AND WITH YOUR OWN CARDS. [HE PAUSES BEFORE CONTINUING IN A FLAT UNEMOTIONAL TONE] IN ANY CASE THERE IS A TOUCH OF GENIUS IN THE SIMPLICITY OF MY PLAN—WHICH CLINCHES THE MATTER. I GIVE YOU THREE SECONDS IN WHICH TO REMOVE YOURSELF. ONE …

[THE INTENDANT HURRIES OUT.]

CÆSONIA: I CAN’T BELIEVE IT’S YOU! BUT IT WAS JUST A JOKE WASN’T IT?—ALL YOU SAID TO HIM.

CALIGULA: NOT QUITE THAT CÆSONIA. LET’S SAY A LESSON IN STATESMANSHIP.

SCIPIO: BUT CAIUS IT’S … IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!

CALIGULA: THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT.

SCIPIO: I DON’T FOLLOW.

CALIGULA: I REPEAT—THAT IS MY POINT. I’M EXPLOITING THE IMPOSSIBLE. OR MORE ACCURATELY IT’S A QUESTION OF MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.

SCIPIO: BUT THAT GAME MAY LEAD TO—TO ANYTHING! IT’S A LUNATIC’S PASTIME.

CALIGULA: NO SCIPIO. AN EMPEROR’S VOCATION. [HE LETS HIMSELF SINK BACK WEARILY AMONG THE CUSHIONS.] AH MY DEARS AT LAST I’VE COME TO SEE THE USES OF SUPREMACY. IT GIVES IMPOSSIBILITIES A RUN. FROM THIS DAY ON SO LONG AS LIFE IS MINE MY FREEDOM HAS NO FRONTIER.

CÆSONIA [SADLY]: I DOUBT IF THIS DISCOVERY OF YOURS WILL MAKE US ANY HAPPIER.

CALIGULA: SO DO I. BUT I SUPPOSE WE’LL HAVE TO LIVE IT THROUGH.

[CHEREA ENTERS.]

CHEREA: I HAVE JUST HEARD OF YOUR RETURN. I TRUST YOUR HEALTH IS ALL IT SHOULD BE.

CALIGULA: MY HEALTH IS DULY GRATEFUL. [A PAUSE. THEN ABRUPTLY] LEAVE US CHEREA. I DON’T WANT TO SEE YOU.

CHEREA: REALLY CAIUS I’M AMAZED …

CALIGULA: THERE’S NOTHING TO BE AMAZED AT. I DON’T LIKE LITERARY MEN AND I CAN’T BEAR LIES.

CHEREA: IF WE LIE IT’S OFTEN WITHOUT KNOWING IT. I PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

CALIGULA: LIES ARE NEVER GUILTLESS. AND YOURS ATTRIBUTE IMPORTANCE TO PEOPLE AND TO THINGS. THAT’S WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOU.

CHEREA: AND YET—SINCE THIS WORLD IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE WHY NOT PLEAD ITS CAUSE?

CALIGULA: YOUR PLEADING COMES TOO LATE THE VERDICT’S GIVEN.… THIS WORLD HAS NO IMPORTANCE; ONCE A MAN REALIZES THAT HE WINS HIS FREEDOM. [HE HAS RISEN TO HIS FEET.] AND THAT IS WHY I HATE YOU YOU AND YOUR KIND; BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FREE. YOU SEE IN ME THE ONE FREE MAN IN THE WHOLE ROMAN EMPIRE. YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE AT LAST AMONG YOU AN EMPEROR WHO POINTS THE WAY TO FREEDOM. LEAVE ME CHEREA; AND YOU TOO SCIPIO GO—FOR WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP? GO BOTH OF YOU AND SPREAD THE NEWS IN ROME THAT FREEDOM HAS BEEN GIVEN HER AT LAST AND WITH THE GIFT BEGINS A GREAT PROBATION.

[THEY GO OUT. CALIGULA HAS TURNED AWAY HIDING HIS EYES.]

CÆSONIA: CRYING?

CALIGULA: YES CÆSONIA.

CÆSONIA: BUT AFTER ALL WHAT’S CHANGED IN YOUR LIFE? YOU MAY HAVE LOVED DRUSILLA BUT YOU LOVED MANY OTHERS—MYSELF INCLUDED—AT THE SAME TIME. SURELY THAT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SET YOU ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS AND BRING YOU BACK WITH THIS … THIS CRUEL LOOK ON YOUR FACE?

CALIGULA [SWINGING ROUND ON HER]: WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS? WHY DRAG IN DRUSILLA? DO YOU IMAGINE LOVE’S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN MAKE A MAN SHED TEARS?

CÆSONIA: I’M SORRY CAIUS. ONLY I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

CALIGULA: MEN WEEP BECAUSE … THE WORLD’S ALL WRONG. [SHE COMES TOWARD HIM.] NO CÆSONIA. [SHE DRAWS BACK.] BUT STAY BESIDE ME.

CÆSONIA: I’LL DO WHATEVER YOU WISH. [SITS DOWN.] AT MY AGE ONE KNOWS THAT LIFE’S A SAD BUSINESS. BUT WHY DELIBERATELY SET OUT TO MAKE IT WORSE?

CALIGULA: NO IT’S NO GOOD; YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND. BUT WHAT MATTER? PERHAPS I’LL FIND A WAY OUT. ONLY I FEEL A CURIOUS STIRRING WITHIN ME AS IF UNDREAMED OF THINGS WERE FORCING THEIR WAY UP INTO THE LIGHT—AND I’M HELPLESS AGAINST THEM. [HE MOVES CLOSER TO HER.] OH CÆSONIA I KNEW THAT MEN FELT ANGUISH BUT I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THAT WORD ANGUISH MEANT. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I FANCIED IT WAS A SICKNESS OF THE MIND—NO MORE. BUT NO IT’S MY BODY THAT’S IN PAIN. PAIN EVERYWHERE IN MY CHEST IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. EVEN MY SKIN IS RAW MY HEAD IS BUZZING I FEEL LIKE VOMITING. BUT WORST OF ALL IS THIS QUEER TASTE IN MY MOUTH. NOT BLOOD OR DEATH OR FEVER BUT A MIXTURE OF ALL THREE. I’VE ONLY TO STIR MY TONGUE AND THE WORLD GOES BLACK AND EVERYONE LOOKS … HORRIBLE. HOW HARD HOW CRUEL IT IS THIS PROCESS OF BECOMING A MAN!

CÆSONIA: WHAT YOU NEED MY DEAR IS A GOOD LONG SLEEP. LET YOURSELF RELAX AND ABOVE ALL STOP THINKING. I’LL STAY BY YOU WHILE YOU SLEEP. AND WHEN YOU WAKE YOU’LL FIND THE WORLD’S GOT BACK ITS SAVOR. THEN YOU MUST USE YOUR POWER TO GOOD EFFECT—FOR LOVING BETTER WHAT YOU STILL FIND LOVABLE. FOR THE POSSIBLE TOO DESERVES TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE.

CALIGULA: AH BUT FOR THAT I’D NEED TO SLEEP TO LET MYSELF GO—AND THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

CÆSONIA: SO ONE ALWAYS THINKS WHEN ONE IS OVERTIRED. A TIME COMES WHEN ONE’S HAND IS FIRM AGAIN.

CALIGULA: BUT ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO PLACE IT. AND WHAT’S THE USE TO ME OF A FIRM HAND WHAT USE IS THE AMAZING POWER THAT’S MINE IF I CAN’T HAVE THE SUN SET IN THE EAST IF I CAN’T REDUCE THE SUM OF SUFFERING AND MAKE AN END OF DEATH? NO CÆSONIA IT’S ALL ONE WHETHER I SLEEP OR KEEP AWAKE IF I’VE NO POWER TO TAMPER WITH THE SCHEME OF THINGS.

CÆSONIA: BUT THAT’S MADNESS SHEER MADNESS. IT’S WANTING TO BE A GOD ON EARTH.

CALIGULA: SO YOU TOO THINK I’M MAD. AND YET—WHAT IS A GOD THAT I SHOULD WISH TO BE HIS EQUAL? NO IT’S SOMETHING HIGHER FAR ABOVE THE GODS THAT I’M AIMING AT LONGING FOR WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. I AM TAKING OVER A KINGDOM WHERE THE IMPOSSIBLE IS KING.

CÆSONIA: YOU CAN’T PREVENT THE SKY FROM BEING THE SKY OR A FRESH YOUNG FACE FROM AGING OR A MAN’S HEART FROM GROWING COLD.

CALIGULA [WITH RISING EXCITEMENT]: I WANT … I WANT TO DROWN THE SKY IN THE SEA TO INFUSE UGLINESS WITH BEAUTY TO WRING A LAUGH FROM PAIN.

CÆSONIA [FACING HIM WITH AN IMPLORING GESTURE]: THERE’S GOOD AND BAD HIGH AND LOW JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. AND I SWEAR TO YOU THESE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TONE]: AND I’M RESOLVED TO CHANGE THEM … I SHALL MAKE THIS AGE OF OURS A KINGLY GIFT—THE GIFT OF EQUALITY. AND WHEN ALL IS LEVELED OUT WHEN THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS COME TO EARTH AND THE MOON IS IN MY HANDS—THEN PERHAPS I SHALL BE TRANSFIGURED AND THE WORLD RENEWED; THEN MEN WILL DIE NO MORE AND AT LAST BE HAPPY.

CÆSONIA [WITH A LITTLE CRY]: AND LOVE? SURELY YOU WON’T GO BACK ON LOVE!

CALIGULA [IN A WILD BURST OF ANGER]: LOVE CÆSONIA! [HE GRIPS HER SHOULDERS AND SHAKES HER.] I’VE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE; IT’S NOTHING NOTHING! THAT FELLOW WAS QUITE RIGHT—YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID DIDN’T YOU?—IT’S ONLY THE TREASURY THAT COUNTS. THE FOUNTAINHEAD OF ALL. AH NOW AT LAST I’M GOING TO LIVE REALLY LIVE. AND LIVING MY DEAR IS THE OPPOSITE OF LOVING. I KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT—AND I INVITE YOU TO THE MOST GORGEOUS OF SHOWS A SIGHT FOR GODS TO GLOAT ON A WHOLE WORLD CALLED TO JUDGMENT. BUT FOR THAT I MUST HAVE A CROWD—SPECTATORS VICTIMS CRIMINALS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM. [HE RUSHES TO THE GONG AND BEGINS HAMMERING ON IT FASTER AND FASTER.] LET THE ACCUSED COME FORWARD. I WANT MY CRIMINALS AND THEY ALL ARE CRIMINALS. [STILL STRIKING THE GONG.] BRING IN THE CONDEMNED MEN. I MUST HAVE MY PUBLIC. JUDGES WITNESSES ACCUSED—ALL SENTENCED TO DEATH WITHOUT A HEARING. YES CÆSONIA I’LL SHOW THEM SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE ONE FREE MAN IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE. [TO THE CLANGOR OF THE GONG THE PALACE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY FILLING WITH NOISES; THE CLASH OF ARMS VOICES FOOTSTEPS SLOW OR HURRIED COMING NEARER GROWING LOUDER. SOME SOLDIERS ENTER AND LEAVE HASTILY.] AND YOU CÆSONIA SHALL OBEY ME. YOU MUST STAND BY ME TO THE END. IT WILL BE MARVELOUS YOU’LL SEE. SWEAR TO STAND BY ME CÆSONIA.

CÆSONIA [WILDLY BETWEEN TWO GONG STROKES]: I NEEDN’T SWEAR. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TONE]: YOU’LL DO ALL I TELL YOU.

CÆSONIA: ALL ALL CALIGULA—BUT DO PLEASE STOP.…

CALIGULA [STILL STRIKING THE GONG]: YOU WILL BE CRUEL.

CÆSONIA [SOBBING]: CRUEL.

CALIGULA [STILL BEATING THE GONG]: COLD AND RUTHLESS.

CÆSONIA: RUTHLESS.

CALIGULA: AND YOU WILL SUFFER TOO.

CÆSONIA: YES YES—OH NO PLEASE … I’M—I’M GOING MAD I THINK! [SOME PATRICIANS ENTER FOLLOWED BY MEMBERS OF THE PALACE STAFF. ALL LOOK BEWILDERED AND PERTURBED. CALIGULA BANGS THE GONG FOR THE LAST TIME RAISES HIS MALLET SWINGS ROUND AND SUMMONS THEM IN A SHRILL HALF-CRAZY VOICE.]

CALIGULA: COME HERE. ALL OF YOU. NEARER. NEARER STILL. [HE IS QUIVERING WITH IMPATIENCE.] YOUR EMPEROR COMMANDS YOU TO COME NEARER. [THEY COME FORWARD PALE WITH TERROR.] QUICKLY. AND YOU CÆSONIA COME BESIDE ME. [HE TAKES HER HAND LEADS HER TO THE MIRROR AND WITH A WILD SWEEP OF HIS MALLET EFFACES A REFLECTION ON ITS SURFACE. THEN GIVES A SUDDEN LAUGH.] ALL GONE. YOU SEE MY DEAR? AN END OF MEMORIES; NO MORE MASKS. NOTHING NOBODY LEFT. NOBODY? NO THAT’S NOT TRUE. LOOK CÆSONIA. COME HERE ALL OF YOU AND LOOK …

[HE PLANTS HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR IN A GROTESQUE ATTITUDE.]

CÆSONIA [STARING HORRIFIED AT THE MIRROR]: CALIGULA! [CALIGULA LAYS A FINGER ON THE GLASS. HIS GAZE STEADIES ABRUPTLY AND WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE HAS A NEW PROUD ARDOR.]

CALIGULA: YES … CALIGULA.
ACT I
A NUMBER OF PATRICIANS ONE A VERY OLD MAN ARE GATHERED IN A STATE ROOM OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE. THEY ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF NERVOUSNESS.


FIRST PATRICIAN: STILL NO NEWS.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: NONE LAST NIGHT NONE THIS MORNING.

SECOND PATRICIAN: THREE DAYS WITHOUT NEWS. STRANGE INDEED!

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OUR MESSENGERS GO OUT OUR MESSENGERS RETURN. AND ALWAYS THEY SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY: “NOTHING.”

SECOND PATRICIAN: THEY’VE COMBED THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE. WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE?

FIRST PATRICIAN: WE CAN ONLY WAIT. IT’S NO USE MEETING TROUBLE HALFWAY. PERHAPS HE’LL RETURN AS ABRUPTLY AS HE LEFT US.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WHEN I SAW HIM LEAVING THE PALACE I NOTICED A QUEER LOOK IN HIS EYES.

FIRST PATRICIAN: YES SO DID I. IN FACT I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS AMISS.

SECOND PATRICIAN: DID HE ANSWER?

FIRST PATRICIAN: ONE WORD: “NOTHING.”

[A SHORT SILENCE. HELICON ENTERS. HE IS MUNCHING ONIONS.]

SECOND PATRICIAN [IN THE SAME NERVOUS TONE]: IT’S ALL VERY PERTURBING.

FIRST PATRICIAN: OH COME NOW! ALL YOUNG FELLOWS ARE LIKE THAT.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YOU’RE RIGHT THERE. THEY TAKE THINGS HARD. BUT TIME SMOOTHS EVERYTHING OUT.

SECOND PATRICIAN: DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OF COURSE. FOR ONE GIRL DEAD A DOZEN LIVING ONES.

HELICON: AH? SO YOU THINK THAT THERE’S A GIRL BEHIND IT?

FIRST PATRICIAN: WHAT ELSE SHOULD THERE BE? ANYHOW—THANK GOODNESS!—GRIEF NEVER LASTS FOREVER. IS ANY ONE OF US HERE CAPABLE OF MOURNING A LOSS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR ON END?

SECOND PATRICIAN: NOT I ANYHOW.

FIRST PATRICIAN: NO ONE CAN DO THAT.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: LIFE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE IF ONE COULD.

FIRST PATRICIAN: QUITE SO. TAKE MY CASE. I LOST MY WIFE LAST YEAR. I SHED MANY TEARS AND THEN I FORGOT. EVEN NOW I FEEL A PANG OF GRIEF AT TIMES. BUT HAPPILY IT DOESN’T AMOUNT TO MUCH.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YES NATURE’S A GREAT HEALER.

[CHEREA ENTERS.]

FIRST PATRICIAN: WELL …?

CHEREA: STILL NOTHING.

HELICON: COME GENTLEMEN! THERE’S NO NEED FOR CONSTERNATION.

FIRST PATRICIAN: I AGREE.

HELICON: WORRYING WON’T MEND MATTERS—AND IT’S LUNCHTIME.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: THAT’S SO. WE MUSTN’T DROP THE PREY FOR THE SHADOW.

CHEREA: I DON’T LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS. BUT ALL WAS GOING TOO SMOOTHLY. AS AN EMPEROR HE WAS PERFECTION’S SELF.

SECOND PATRICIAN: YES EXACTLY THE EMPEROR WE WANTED; CONSCIENTIOUS AND INEXPERIENCED.

FIRST PATRICIAN: BUT WHAT’S COME OVER YOU? THERE’S NO REASON FOR ALL THESE LAMENTATIONS. WE’VE NO GROUND FOR ASSUMING HE WILL CHANGE. LET’S SAY HE LOVED DRUSILLA. ONLY NATURAL; SHE WAS HIS SISTER. OR SAY HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN BROTHERLY; SHOCKING ENOUGH I GRANT YOU. BUT IT’S REALLY GOING TOO FAR SETTING ALL ROME IN A TURMOIL BECAUSE THE GIRL HAS DIED.

CHEREA: MAYBE. BUT AS I SAID I DON’T LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS; THIS ESCAPADE ALARMS ME.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: YES THERE’S NEVER SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE.

FIRST PATRICIAN: IN ANY CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE SHOULD PREVENT HIS MAKING A PUBLIC TRAGEDY OF … OF LET’S SAY A REGRETTABLE ATTACHMENT. NO DOUBT SUCH THINGS HAPPEN; BUT THE LESS SAID THE BETTER.

HELICON: HOW CAN YOU BE SURE DRUSILLA IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE?

SECOND PATRICIAN: WHO ELSE SHOULD IT BE?

HELICON: NOBODY AT ALL QUITE LIKELY. WHEN THERE’S A HOST OF EXPLANATIONS TO CHOOSE FROM WHY PICK ON THE STUPIDEST MOST OBVIOUS ONE?

[YOUNG SCIPIO ENTERS. CHEREA GOES TOWARD HIM.]

CHEREA: WELL?

SCIPIO: STILL NOTHING. EXCEPT THAT SOME PEASANTS THINK THEY SAW HIM LAST NIGHT NOT FAR FROM ROME RUSHING THROUGH THE STORM.

[CHEREA COMES BACK TO THE PATRICIANS SCIPIO FOLLOWING HIM.]

CHEREA: THAT MAKES THREE DAYS SCIPIO DOESN’T IT?

SCIPIO: YES … I WAS THERE FOLLOWING HIM AS I USUALLY DO. HE WENT UP TO DRUSILLA’S BODY. HE STROKED IT WITH TWO FINGERS AND SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A LONG WHILE. THEN HE SWUNG ROUND AND WALKED OUT CALMLY ENOUGH.… AND EVER SINCE WE’VE BEEN HUNTING FOR HIM—IN VAIN.

CHEREA [SHAKING HIS HEAD]: THAT YOUNG MAN WAS TOO FOND OF LITERATURE.

SECOND PATRICIAN: OH AT HIS AGE YOU KNOW …

CHEREA: AT HIS AGE PERHAPS; BUT NOT IN HIS POSITION. AN ARTISTIC EMPEROR IS AN ANOMALY. I GRANT YOU WE’VE HAD ONE OR TWO; MISFITS HAPPEN IN THE BEST OF EMPIRES. BUT THE OTHERS HAD THE GOOD TASTE TO REMEMBER THEY WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS.

FIRST PATRICIAN: IT MADE THINGS RUN MORE SMOOTHLY.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: ONE MAN ONE JOB—THAT’S HOW IT SHOULD BE.

SCIPIO: WHAT CAN WE DO CHEREA?

CHEREA: NOTHING.

SECOND PATRICIAN: WE CAN ONLY WAIT. IF HE DOESN’T RETURN A SUCCESSOR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND. BETWEEN OURSELVES—THERE’S NO SHORTAGE OF CANDIDATES.

FIRST PATRICIAN: NO BUT THERE’S A SHORTAGE OF THE RIGHT SORT.

CHEREA: SUPPOSE HE COMES BACK IN AN UGLY MOOD?

FIRST PATRICIAN: OH HE’S A MERE BOY; WE’LL MAKE HIM SEE REASON.

CHEREA: AND WHAT IF HE DECLINES TO SEE IT?

FIRST PATRICIAN [LAUGHING]: IN THAT CASE MY FRIEND DON’T FORGET I ONCE WROTE A MANUAL OF REVOLUTIONS. YOU’LL FIND ALL THE RULES THERE.

CHEREA: I’LL LOOK IT UP—IF THINGS COME TO THAT. BUT I’D RATHER BE LEFT TO MY BOOKS.

SCIPIO: IF YOU’LL EXCUSE ME.…

[GOES OUT.]

CHEREA: HE’S OFFENDED.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: SCIPIO IS YOUNG AND YOUNG PEOPLE ALWAYS HANG TOGETHER.

HELICON: SCIPIO DOESN’T COUNT ANYHOW.

[ENTER A MEMBER OF THE IMPERIAL BODYGUARD.]

THE GUARDSMAN: CALIGULA HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE PALACE GARDENS.

[ALL LEAVE THE ROOM. THE STAGE IS EMPTY FOR SOME MOMENTS. THEN CALIGULA ENTERS STEALTHILY FROM THE LEFT. HIS LEGS ARE CAKED WITH MUD HIS GARMENTS DIRTY; HIS HAIR IS WET HIS LOOK DISTRAUGHT. HE BRINGS HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH SEVERAL TIMES. THEN HE APPROACHES A MIRROR STOPPING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE CATCHES SIGHT OF HIS REFLECTED SELF. AFTER MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS HE SITS DOWN ON THE RIGHT LETTING HIS ARMS HANG LIMP BETWEEN HIS KNEES. HELICON ENTERS LEFT. ON SEEING CALIGULA HE STOPS AT THE FAR END OF THE STAGE AND CONTEMPLATES HIM IN SILENCE. CALIGULA TURNS AND SEES HIM. A SHORT SILENCE.]

HELICON [ACROSS THE STAGE]: GOOD MORNING CAIUS.

CALIGULA [IN QUITE AN ORDINARY TONE]: GOOD MORNING HELICON.

[A SHORT SILENCE.]

HELICON: YOU’RE LOOKING TIRED.

CALIGULA: I’VE WALKED A LOT.

HELICON: YES YOU’VE BEEN AWAY FOR QUITE A WHILE.

[ANOTHER SHORT SILENCE.]

CALIGULA: IT WAS HARD TO FIND.

HELICON: WHAT WAS HARD TO FIND?

CALIGULA: WHAT I WAS AFTER.

HELICON: MEANING?

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME MATTER-OF-FACT TONE]: THE MOON.

HELICON: WHAT?

CALIGULA: YES I WANTED THE MOON.

HELICON: AH.… [ANOTHER SILENCE. HELICON APPROACHES CALIGULA.] AND WHY DID YOU WANT IT?

CALIGULA: WELL … IT’S ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVEN’T GOT.

HELICON: I SEE. AND NOW—HAVE YOU FIXED IT UP TO YOUR SATISFACTION?

CALIGULA: NO. I COULDN’T GET IT.

HELICON: TOO BAD!

CALIGULA: YES AND THAT’S WHY I’M TIRED. [PAUSES. THEN] HELICON!

HELICON: YES CAIUS?

CALIGULA: NO DOUBT YOU THINK I’M CRAZY.

HELICON: AS YOU KNOW WELL I NEVER THINK.

CALIGULA: AH YES.… NOW LISTEN! I’M NOT MAD; IN FACT I’VE NEVER FELT SO LUCID. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS QUITE SIMPLE; I SUDDENLY FELT A DESIRE FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE. THAT’S ALL. [PAUSES.] THINGS AS THEY ARE IN MY OPINION ARE FAR FROM SATISFACTORY.

HELICON: MANY PEOPLE SHARE YOUR OPINION.

CALIGULA: THAT IS SO. BUT IN THE PAST I DIDN’T REALIZE IT. NOW I KNOW. [STILL IN THE SAME MATTER-OF-FACT TONE] REALLY THIS WORLD OF OURS THE SCHEME OF THINGS AS THEY CALL IT IS QUITE INTOLERABLE. THAT’S WHY I WANT THE MOON OR HAPPINESS OR ETERNAL LIFE—SOMETHING IN FACT THAT MAY SOUND CRAZY BUT WHICH ISN’T OF THIS WORLD.

HELICON: THAT’S SOUND ENOUGH IN THEORY. ONLY IN PRACTICE ONE CAN’T CARRY IT THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION.

CALIGULA [RISING TO HIS FEET BUT STILL WITH PERFECT CALMNESS]: YOU’RE WRONG THERE. IT’S JUST BECAUSE NO ONE DARES TO FOLLOW UP HIS IDEAS TO THE END THAT NOTHING IS ACHIEVED. ALL THAT’S NEEDED I SHOULD SAY IS TO BE LOGICAL RIGHT THROUGH AT ALL COSTS. [HE STUDIES HELICON’S FACE.] I CAN SEE TOO WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. WHAT A FUSS OVER A WOMAN’S DEATH! BUT THAT’S NOT IT. TRUE ENOUGH I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT A WOMAN DIED SOME DAYS AGO; A WOMAN WHOM I LOVED. BUT LOVE WHAT IS IT? A SIDE ISSUE. AND I SWEAR TO YOU HER DEATH IS NOT THE POINT; IT’S NO MORE THAN THE SYMBOL OF A TRUTH THAT MAKES THE MOON ESSENTIAL TO ME. A CHILDISHLY SIMPLE OBVIOUS ALMOST SILLY TRUTH BUT ONE THAT’S HARD TO COME BY AND HEAVY TO ENDURE.

HELICON: MAY I KNOW WHAT IT IS THIS TRUTH THAT YOU’VE DISCOVERED?

CALIGULA [HIS EYES AVERTED IN A TONELESS VOICE]: MEN DIE; AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY.

HELICON [AFTER A SHORT PAUSE]: ANYHOW CALIGULA IT’S A TRUTH WITH WHICH ONE COMES TO TERMS WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE. ONLY LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OVER THERE. THIS TRUTH OF YOURS DOESN’T PREVENT THEM FROM ENJOYING THEIR MEAL.

CALIGULA [WTH SUDDEN VIOLENCE]: ALL IT PROVES IS THAT I’M SURROUNDED BY LIES AND SELF-DECEPTION. BUT I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT; I WISH MEN TO LIVE BY THE LIGHT OF TRUTH. AND I’VE THE POWER TO MAKE THEM DO SO. FOR I KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND HAVEN’T GOT. THEY’RE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING AND THEY NEED A TEACHER; SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT.

HELICON: DON’T TAKE OFFENSE CAIUS IF I GIVE YOU A WORD OF ADVICE.… BUT THAT CAN WAIT. FIRST YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME REST.

CALIGULA [SITTING DOWN. HIS VOICE IS GENTLE AGAIN]: THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE HELICON. I SHALL NEVER REST AGAIN.

HELICON: BUT—WHY?

CALIGULA: IF I SLEEP WHO’LL GIVE ME THE MOON?

HELICON [AFTER A SHORT SILENCE]: THAT’S TRUE.

CALIGULA [RISING TO HIS FEET AGAIN WITH AN EFFORT]: LISTEN HELICON … I HEAR FOOTSTEPS VOICES. SAY NOTHING—AND FORGET YOU’VE SEEN ME.

HELICON: I UNDERSTAND.

CALIGULA [LOOKING BACK AS HE MOVES TOWARD THE DOOR]: AND PLEASE HELP ME FROM NOW ON.

HELICON: I’VE NO REASON NOT TO DO SO CAIUS. BUT I KNOW VERY FEW THINGS AND FEW THINGS INTEREST ME. IN WHAT WAY CAN I HELP YOU?

CALIGULA: IN THE WAY OF … THE IMPOSSIBLE.

HELICON: I’LL DO MY BEST.

[CALIGULA GOES OUT. SCIPIO AND CÆSONIA ENTER HURRIEDLY.]

SCIPIO: NO ONE! HAVEN’T YOU SEEN HIM?

HELICON: NO.

CÆSONIA: TELL ME HELICON. ARE YOU QUITE SURE HE DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING TO YOU BEFORE HE WENT AWAY?

HELICON: I’M NOT A SHARER OF HIS SECRETS I’M HIS PUBLIC. A MERE ONLOOKER. IT’S MORE PRUDENT.

CÆSONIA: PLEASE DON’T TALK LIKE THAT.

HELICON: MY DEAR CÆSONIA CAIUS IS AN IDEALIST AS WE ALL KNOW. HE FOLLOWS HIS BENT AND NO ONE CAN FORESEE WHERE IT WILL TAKE HIM.… BUT IF YOU’LL EXCUSE ME I’LL GO TO LUNCH.

[EXIT HELICON.]

CÆSONIA [SINKING WEARILY ONTO A DIVAN]: ONE OF THE PALACE GUARDS SAW HIM GO BY. BUT ALL ROME SEES CALIGULA EVERYWHERE. AND CALIGULA OF COURSE SEES NOTHING BUT HIS OWN IDEA.

SCIPIO: WHAT IDEA?

CÆSONIA: HOW CAN I TELL SCIPIO?

SCIPIO: ARE YOU THINKING OF DRUSILLA?

CÆSONIA: PERHAPS. ONE THING IS SURE; HE LOVED HER. AND IT’S A CRUEL THING TO HAVE SOMEONE DIE TODAY WHOM ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE HOLDING IN YOUR ARMS.

SCIPIO [TIMIDLY]: AND YOU …?

CÆSONIA: OH I’M THE OLD TRUSTED MISTRESS. THAT’S MY ROLE.

SCIPIO: CÆSONIA WE MUST SAVE HIM.

CÆSONIA: SO YOU TOO LOVE HIM?

SCIPIO: YES. HE’S BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME. HE ENCOURAGED ME; I SHALL NEVER FORGET SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID. HE TOLD ME LIFE ISN’T EASY BUT IT HAS CONSOLATIONS: RELIGION ART AND THE LOVE ONE INSPIRES IN OTHERS. HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT THE ONLY MISTAKE ONE MAKES IN LIFE IS TO CAUSE OTHERS SUFFERING. HE TRIED TO BE A JUST MAN.

CÆSONIA [RISING]: HE’S ONLY A CHILD. [SHE GOES TO THE GLASS AND SCANS HERSELF.] THE ONLY GOD I’VE EVER HAD IS MY BODY AND NOW I SHALL PRAY THIS GOD OF MINE TO GIVE CAIUS BACK TO ME.

[CALIGULA ENTERS. ON SEEING CÆSONIA AND SCIPIO HE HESITATES AND TAKES A BACKWARD STEP. AT THE SAME MOMENT SEVERAL MEN ENTER FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM: PATRICIANS AND THE INTENDANT OF THE PALACE. THEY STOP SHORT WHEN THEY SEE CALIGULA. CÆSONIA TURNS. SHE AND SCIPIO HURRY TOWARD CALIGULA WHO CHECKS THEM WITH A GESTURE.]

INTENDANT [IN A RATHER QUAVERING VOICE]: WE … WE’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU CÆSAR HIGH AND LOW.

CALIGULA [IN A CHANGED HARSH TONE]: SO I SEE.

INTENDANT: WE … I MEAN …

CALIGULA [ROUGHLY]: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

INTENDANT: WE WERE FEELING ANXIOUS CÆSAR.

CALIGULA [GOING TOWARD HIM]: WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO FEEL ANXIOUS?

INTENDANT: WELL … ER … [HE HAS AN INSPIRATION.] WELL AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE POINTS TO BE SETTLED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREASURY.

CALIGULA [BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER]: AH YES. THE TREASURY! THAT’S SO. THE TREASURY’S OF PRIME IMPORTANCE.

INTENDANT: YES INDEED.

CALIGULA [STILL LAUGHING TO CÆSONIA]: DON’T YOU AGREE MY DEAR? THE TREASURY IS ALL-IMPORTANT.

CÆSONIA: NO CALIGULA. IT’S A SECONDARY MATTER.

CALIGULA: THAT ONLY SHOWS YOUR IGNORANCE. WE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN OUR TREASURY. EVERYTHING’S IMPORTANT: OUR FISCAL SYSTEM PUBLIC MORALS FOREIGN POLICY ARMY EQUIPMENT AND AGRARIAN LAWS. EVERYTHING’S OF CARDINAL IMPORTANCE I ASSURE YOU. AND EVERYTHING’S ON AN EQUAL FOOTING: THE GRANDEUR OF ROME AND YOUR ATTACKS OF ARTHRITIS.… WELL WELL I’M GOING TO APPLY MY MIND TO ALL THAT. AND TO BEGIN WITH … NOW LISTEN WELL INTENDANT.

INTENDANT: WE ARE LISTENING SIR.

[THE PATRICIANS COME FORWARD.]

CALIGULA: YOU’RE OUR LOYAL SUBJECTS ARE YOU NOT?

INTENDANT [IN A REPROACHFUL TONE]: OH CÆSAR …!

CALIGULA: WELL I’VE SOMETHING TO PROPOSE TO YOU. WE’RE GOING TO MAKE A COMPLETE CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IN TWO MOVES. DRASTIC AND ABRUPT. I’LL EXPLAIN INTENDANT … WHEN THE PATRICIANS HAVE LEFT. [THE PATRICIANS GO OUT. CALIGULA SEATS HIMSELF BESIDE CÆSONIA WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST.] NOW MARK MY WORDS. THE FIRST MOVE’S THIS. EVERY PATRICIAN EVERYONE IN THE EMPIRE WHO HAS ANY CAPITAL—SMALL OR LARGE IT’S ALL THE SAME THING—IS ORDERED TO DISINHERIT HIS CHILDREN AND MAKE A NEW WILL LEAVING HIS MONEY TO THE STATE.

INTENDANT: BUT CÆSAR …

CALIGULA: I’VE NOT YET GIVEN YOU LEAVE TO SPEAK. AS THE NEED ARISES WE SHALL HAVE THESE PEOPLE DIE; A LIST WILL BE DRAWN UP BY US FIXING THE ORDER OF THEIR DEATHS. WHEN THE FANCY TAKES US WE MAY MODIFY THAT ORDER. AND OF COURSE WE SHALL STEP INTO THEIR MONEY.

CÆSONIA [FREEING HERSELF]: BUT—WHAT’S COME OVER YOU?

CALIGULA [IMPERTURBABLY]: OBVIOUSLY THE ORDER OF THEIR GOING HAS NO IMPORTANCE. OR RATHER ALL THESE EXECUTIONS HAVE AN EQUAL IMPORTANCE—FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT NONE HAS ANY. REALLY ALL THOSE FELLOWS ARE ON A PAR ONE’S AS GUILTY AS ANOTHER. [TO THE INTENDANT PEREMPTORILY] YOU ARE TO PROMULGATE THIS EDICT WITHOUT A MOMENT’S DELAY AND SEE IT’S CARRIED OUT FORTHWITH. THE WILLS ARE TO BE SIGNED BY RESIDENTS IN ROME THIS EVENING; WITHIN A MONTH AT THE LATEST BY PERSONS IN THE PROVINCES. SEND OUT YOUR MESSENGERS.

INTENDANT: CÆSAR I WONDER IF YOU REALIZE …

CALIGULA: DO I REALIZE …? NOW LISTEN WELL YOU FOOL! IF THE TREASURY HAS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE HUMAN LIFE HAS NONE. THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO YOU. PEOPLE WHO THINK LIKE YOU ARE BOUND TO ADMIT THE LOGIC OF MY EDICT AND SINCE MONEY IS THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS SHOULD SET NO VALUE ON THEIR LIVES OR ANYONE ELSE’S. I HAVE RESOLVED TO BE LOGICAL AND I HAVE THE POWER TO ENFORCE MY WILL. PRESENTLY YOU’LL SEE WHAT LOGIC’S GOING TO COST YOU? I SHALL ELIMINATE CONTRADICTIONS AND CONTRADICTERS. IF NECESSARY I’LL BEGIN WITH YOU.

INTENDANT: CÆSAR MY GOOD WILL CAN BE RELIED ON THAT I SWEAR.

CALIGULA: AND MINE TOO; THAT I GUARANTEE. JUST SEE HOW READY I AM TO ADOPT YOUR POINT OF VIEW AND GIVE THE TREASURY THE FIRST PLACE IN MY PROGRAM. REALLY YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO ME; I’M PLAYING INTO YOUR HAND AND WITH YOUR OWN CARDS. [HE PAUSES BEFORE CONTINUING IN A FLAT UNEMOTIONAL TONE] IN ANY CASE THERE IS A TOUCH OF GENIUS IN THE SIMPLICITY OF MY PLAN—WHICH CLINCHES THE MATTER. I GIVE YOU THREE SECONDS IN WHICH TO REMOVE YOURSELF. ONE …

[THE INTENDANT HURRIES OUT.]

CÆSONIA: I CAN’T BELIEVE IT’S YOU! BUT IT WAS JUST A JOKE WASN’T IT?—ALL YOU SAID TO HIM.

CALIGULA: NOT QUITE THAT CÆSONIA. LET’S SAY A LESSON IN STATESMANSHIP.

SCIPIO: BUT CAIUS IT’S … IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!

CALIGULA: THAT’S THE WHOLE POINT.

SCIPIO: I DON’T FOLLOW.

CALIGULA: I REPEAT—THAT IS MY POINT. I’M EXPLOITING THE IMPOSSIBLE. OR MORE ACCURATELY IT’S A QUESTION OF MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.

SCIPIO: BUT THAT GAME MAY LEAD TO—TO ANYTHING! IT’S A LUNATIC’S PASTIME.

CALIGULA: NO SCIPIO. AN EMPEROR’S VOCATION. [HE LETS HIMSELF SINK BACK WEARILY AMONG THE CUSHIONS.] AH MY DEARS AT LAST I’VE COME TO SEE THE USES OF SUPREMACY. IT GIVES IMPOSSIBILITIES A RUN. FROM THIS DAY ON SO LONG AS LIFE IS MINE MY FREEDOM HAS NO FRONTIER.

CÆSONIA [SADLY]: I DOUBT IF THIS DISCOVERY OF YOURS WILL MAKE US ANY HAPPIER.

CALIGULA: SO DO I. BUT I SUPPOSE WE’LL HAVE TO LIVE IT THROUGH.

[CHEREA ENTERS.]

CHEREA: I HAVE JUST HEARD OF YOUR RETURN. I TRUST YOUR HEALTH IS ALL IT SHOULD BE.

CALIGULA: MY HEALTH IS DULY GRATEFUL. [A PAUSE. THEN ABRUPTLY] LEAVE US CHEREA. I DON’T WANT TO SEE YOU.

CHEREA: REALLY CAIUS I’M AMAZED …

CALIGULA: THERE’S NOTHING TO BE AMAZED AT. I DON’T LIKE LITERARY MEN AND I CAN’T BEAR LIES.

CHEREA: IF WE LIE IT’S OFTEN WITHOUT KNOWING IT. I PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

CALIGULA: LIES ARE NEVER GUILTLESS. AND YOURS ATTRIBUTE IMPORTANCE TO PEOPLE AND TO THINGS. THAT’S WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOU.

CHEREA: AND YET—SINCE THIS WORLD IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE WHY NOT PLEAD ITS CAUSE?

CALIGULA: YOUR PLEADING COMES TOO LATE THE VERDICT’S GIVEN.… THIS WORLD HAS NO IMPORTANCE; ONCE A MAN REALIZES THAT HE WINS HIS FREEDOM. [HE HAS RISEN TO HIS FEET.] AND THAT IS WHY I HATE YOU YOU AND YOUR KIND; BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FREE. YOU SEE IN ME THE ONE FREE MAN IN THE WHOLE ROMAN EMPIRE. YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE AT LAST AMONG YOU AN EMPEROR WHO POINTS THE WAY TO FREEDOM. LEAVE ME CHEREA; AND YOU TOO SCIPIO GO—FOR WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP? GO BOTH OF YOU AND SPREAD THE NEWS IN ROME THAT FREEDOM HAS BEEN GIVEN HER AT LAST AND WITH THE GIFT BEGINS A GREAT PROBATION.

[THEY GO OUT. CALIGULA HAS TURNED AWAY HIDING HIS EYES.]

CÆSONIA: CRYING?

CALIGULA: YES CÆSONIA.

CÆSONIA: BUT AFTER ALL WHAT’S CHANGED IN YOUR LIFE? YOU MAY HAVE LOVED DRUSILLA BUT YOU LOVED MANY OTHERS—MYSELF INCLUDED—AT THE SAME TIME. SURELY THAT WASN’T ENOUGH TO SET YOU ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS AND BRING YOU BACK WITH THIS … THIS CRUEL LOOK ON YOUR FACE?

CALIGULA [SWINGING ROUND ON HER]: WHAT NONSENSE IS THIS? WHY DRAG IN DRUSILLA? DO YOU IMAGINE LOVE’S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN MAKE A MAN SHED TEARS?

CÆSONIA: I’M SORRY CAIUS. ONLY I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

CALIGULA: MEN WEEP BECAUSE … THE WORLD’S ALL WRONG. [SHE COMES TOWARD HIM.] NO CÆSONIA. [SHE DRAWS BACK.] BUT STAY BESIDE ME.

CÆSONIA: I’LL DO WHATEVER YOU WISH. [SITS DOWN.] AT MY AGE ONE KNOWS THAT LIFE’S A SAD BUSINESS. BUT WHY DELIBERATELY SET OUT TO MAKE IT WORSE?

CALIGULA: NO IT’S NO GOOD; YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND. BUT WHAT MATTER? PERHAPS I’LL FIND A WAY OUT. ONLY I FEEL A CURIOUS STIRRING WITHIN ME AS IF UNDREAMED OF THINGS WERE FORCING THEIR WAY UP INTO THE LIGHT—AND I’M HELPLESS AGAINST THEM. [HE MOVES CLOSER TO HER.] OH CÆSONIA I KNEW THAT MEN FELT ANGUISH BUT I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THAT WORD ANGUISH MEANT. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I FANCIED IT WAS A SICKNESS OF THE MIND—NO MORE. BUT NO IT’S MY BODY THAT’S IN PAIN. PAIN EVERYWHERE IN MY CHEST IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. EVEN MY SKIN IS RAW MY HEAD IS BUZZING I FEEL LIKE VOMITING. BUT WORST OF ALL IS THIS QUEER TASTE IN MY MOUTH. NOT BLOOD OR DEATH OR FEVER BUT A MIXTURE OF ALL THREE. I’VE ONLY TO STIR MY TONGUE AND THE WORLD GOES BLACK AND EVERYONE LOOKS … HORRIBLE. HOW HARD HOW CRUEL IT IS THIS PROCESS OF BECOMING A MAN!

CÆSONIA: WHAT YOU NEED MY DEAR IS A GOOD LONG SLEEP. LET YOURSELF RELAX AND ABOVE ALL STOP THINKING. I’LL STAY BY YOU WHILE YOU SLEEP. AND WHEN YOU WAKE YOU’LL FIND THE WORLD’S GOT BACK ITS SAVOR. THEN YOU MUST USE YOUR POWER TO GOOD EFFECT—FOR LOVING BETTER WHAT YOU STILL FIND LOVABLE. FOR THE POSSIBLE TOO DESERVES TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE.

CALIGULA: AH BUT FOR THAT I’D NEED TO SLEEP TO LET MYSELF GO—AND THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

CÆSONIA: SO ONE ALWAYS THINKS WHEN ONE IS OVERTIRED. A TIME COMES WHEN ONE’S HAND IS FIRM AGAIN.

CALIGULA: BUT ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO PLACE IT. AND WHAT’S THE USE TO ME OF A FIRM HAND WHAT USE IS THE AMAZING POWER THAT’S MINE IF I CAN’T HAVE THE SUN SET IN THE EAST IF I CAN’T REDUCE THE SUM OF SUFFERING AND MAKE AN END OF DEATH? NO CÆSONIA IT’S ALL ONE WHETHER I SLEEP OR KEEP AWAKE IF I’VE NO POWER TO TAMPER WITH THE SCHEME OF THINGS.

CÆSONIA: BUT THAT’S MADNESS SHEER MADNESS. IT’S WANTING TO BE A GOD ON EARTH.

CALIGULA: SO YOU TOO THINK I’M MAD. AND YET—WHAT IS A GOD THAT I SHOULD WISH TO BE HIS EQUAL? NO IT’S SOMETHING HIGHER FAR ABOVE THE GODS THAT I’M AIMING AT LONGING FOR WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL. I AM TAKING OVER A KINGDOM WHERE THE IMPOSSIBLE IS KING.

CÆSONIA: YOU CAN’T PREVENT THE SKY FROM BEING THE SKY OR A FRESH YOUNG FACE FROM AGING OR A MAN’S HEART FROM GROWING COLD.

CALIGULA [WITH RISING EXCITEMENT]: I WANT … I WANT TO DROWN THE SKY IN THE SEA TO INFUSE UGLINESS WITH BEAUTY TO WRING A LAUGH FROM PAIN.

CÆSONIA [FACING HIM WITH AN IMPLORING GESTURE]: THERE’S GOOD AND BAD HIGH AND LOW JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. AND I SWEAR TO YOU THESE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TONE]: AND I’M RESOLVED TO CHANGE THEM … I SHALL MAKE THIS AGE OF OURS A KINGLY GIFT—THE GIFT OF EQUALITY. AND WHEN ALL IS LEVELED OUT WHEN THE IMPOSSIBLE HAS COME TO EARTH AND THE MOON IS IN MY HANDS—THEN PERHAPS I SHALL BE TRANSFIGURED AND THE WORLD RENEWED; THEN MEN WILL DIE NO MORE AND AT LAST BE HAPPY.

CÆSONIA [WITH A LITTLE CRY]: AND LOVE? SURELY YOU WON’T GO BACK ON LOVE!

CALIGULA [IN A WILD BURST OF ANGER]: LOVE CÆSONIA! [HE GRIPS HER SHOULDERS AND SHAKES HER.] I’VE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE; IT’S NOTHING NOTHING! THAT FELLOW WAS QUITE RIGHT—YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID DIDN’T YOU?—IT’S ONLY THE TREASURY THAT COUNTS. THE FOUNTAINHEAD OF ALL. AH NOW AT LAST I’M GOING TO LIVE REALLY LIVE. AND LIVING MY DEAR IS THE OPPOSITE OF LOVING. I KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT—AND I INVITE YOU TO THE MOST GORGEOUS OF SHOWS A SIGHT FOR GODS TO GLOAT ON A WHOLE WORLD CALLED TO JUDGMENT. BUT FOR THAT I MUST HAVE A CROWD—SPECTATORS VICTIMS CRIMINALS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM. [HE RUSHES TO THE GONG AND BEGINS HAMMERING ON IT FASTER AND FASTER.] LET THE ACCUSED COME FORWARD. I WANT MY CRIMINALS AND THEY ALL ARE CRIMINALS. [STILL STRIKING THE GONG.] BRING IN THE CONDEMNED MEN. I MUST HAVE MY PUBLIC. JUDGES WITNESSES ACCUSED—ALL SENTENCED TO DEATH WITHOUT A HEARING. YES CÆSONIA I’LL SHOW THEM SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE ONE FREE MAN IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE. [TO THE CLANGOR OF THE GONG THE PALACE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY FILLING WITH NOISES; THE CLASH OF ARMS VOICES FOOTSTEPS SLOW OR HURRIED COMING NEARER GROWING LOUDER. SOME SOLDIERS ENTER AND LEAVE HASTILY.] AND YOU CÆSONIA SHALL OBEY ME. YOU MUST STAND BY ME TO THE END. IT WILL BE MARVELOUS YOU’LL SEE. SWEAR TO STAND BY ME CÆSONIA.

CÆSONIA [WILDLY BETWEEN TWO GONG STROKES]: I NEEDN’T SWEAR. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TONE]: YOU’LL DO ALL I TELL YOU.

CÆSONIA: ALL ALL CALIGULA—BUT DO PLEASE STOP.…

CALIGULA [STILL STRIKING THE GONG]: YOU WILL BE CRUEL.

CÆSONIA [SOBBING]: CRUEL.

CALIGULA [STILL BEATING THE GONG]: COLD AND RUTHLESS.

CÆSONIA: RUTHLESS.

CALIGULA: AND YOU WILL SUFFER TOO.

CÆSONIA: YES YES—OH NO PLEASE … I’M—I’M GOING MAD I THINK! [SOME PATRICIANS ENTER FOLLOWED BY MEMBERS OF THE PALACE STAFF. ALL LOOK BEWILDERED AND PERTURBED. CALIGULA BANGS THE GONG FOR THE LAST TIME RAISES HIS MALLET SWINGS ROUND AND SUMMONS THEM IN A SHRILL HALF-CRAZY VOICE.]

CALIGULA: COME HERE. ALL OF YOU. NEARER. NEARER STILL. [HE IS QUIVERING WITH IMPATIENCE.] YOUR EMPEROR COMMANDS YOU TO COME NEARER. [THEY COME FORWARD PALE WITH TERROR.] QUICKLY. AND YOU CÆSONIA COME BESIDE ME. [HE TAKES HER HAND LEADS HER TO THE MIRROR AND WITH A WILD SWEEP OF HIS MALLET EFFACES A REFLECTION ON ITS SURFACE. THEN GIVES A SUDDEN LAUGH.] ALL GONE. YOU SEE MY DEAR? AN END OF MEMORIES; NO MORE MASKS. NOTHING NOBODY LEFT. NOBODY? NO THAT’S NOT TRUE. LOOK CÆSONIA. COME HERE ALL OF YOU AND LOOK …

[HE PLANTS HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR IN A GROTESQUE ATTITUDE.]

CÆSONIA [STARING HORRIFIED AT THE MIRROR]: CALIGULA! [CALIGULA LAYS A FINGER ON THE GLASS. HIS GAZE STEADIES ABRUPTLY AND WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE HAS A NEW PROUD ARDOR.]

CALIGULA: YES … CALIGULA.

ACT II
THREE YEARS LATER.

A ROOM IN CHEREA’S HOUSE WHERE THE PATRICIANS HAVE MET IN SECRET.

FIRST PATRICIAN: IT’S OUTRAGEOUS THE WAY HE’S TREATING US.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: HE CALLS ME “DARLING”! IN PUBLIC MIND YOU—JUST TO MAKE A LAUGHINGSTOCK OF ME. DEATH’S TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

FIRST PATRICIAN: AND FANCY MAKING US RUN BESIDE HIS LITTER WHEN HE GOES INTO THE COUNTRY.

SECOND PATRICIAN: HE SAYS THE EXERCISE WILL DO US GOOD.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: CONDUCT LIKE THAT IS QUITE INEXCUSABLE.

THIRD PATRICIAN: YOU’RE RIGHT. THAT’S PRECISELY THE SORT OF THING ONE CAN’T FORGIVE.

FIRST PATRICIAN: HE CONFISCATED YOUR PROPERTY PATRICIUS. HE KILLED YOUR FATHER SCIPIO. HE’S TAKEN YOUR WIFE FROM YOU OCTAVIUS AND FORCED HER TO WORK IN HIS PUBLIC BROTHEL. HE HAS KILLED YOUR SON LEPIDUS. I ASK YOU GENTLEMEN CAN YOU ENDURE THIS? I ANYHOW HAVE MADE UP MY MIND. I KNOW THE RISKS BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS LIFE OF ABJECT FEAR IS QUITE UNBEARABLE. WORSE THAN DEATH IN FACT. YES AS I SAID MY MIND’S MADE UP.

SCIPIO: HE MADE MY MIND UP FOR ME WHEN HE HAD MY FATHER PUT TO DEATH.

FIRST PATRICIAN: WELL? CAN YOU STILL HESITATE?

A KNIGHT: NO. WE’RE WITH YOU. HE’S TRANSFERRED OUR STALLS AT THE CIRCUS TO THE PUBLIC AND EGGED US ON TO FIGHT WITH THE RABBLE—JUST TO HAVE A PRETEXT FOR PUNISHING US OF COURSE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: HE’S A COWARD.

SECOND PATRICIAN: A BULLY.

THIRD PATRICIAN: A BUFFOON.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: HE’S IMPOTENT—THAT’S HIS TROUBLE I SHOULD SAY.

[A SCENE OF WILD CONFUSION FOLLOWS WEAPONS ARE BRANDISHED A TABLE IS OVERTURNED AND THERE IS A GENERAL RUSH TOWARD THE DOOR. JUST AT THIS MOMENT CHEREA STROLLS IN COMPOSED AS USUAL AND CHECKS THEIR ONRUSH.]

CHEREA: WHAT’S ALL THIS ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

A PATRICIAN: TO THE PALACE.

CHEREA: AH YES. AND I CAN GUESS WHY. BUT DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BE ALLOWED TO ENTER?

THE PATRICIAN: THERE’S NO QUESTION OF ASKING LEAVE.

CHEREA: LEPIDUS WOULD YOU KINDLY SHUT THAT DOOR? [THE DOOR IS SHUT. CHEREA GOES TO THE OVERTURNED TABLE AND SEATS HIMSELF ON A CORNER OF IT. THE OTHERS TURN TOWARD HIM.] IT’S NOT SO SIMPLE AS YOU THINK MY FRIENDS. YOU’RE AFRAID BUT FEAR CAN’T TAKE THE PLACE OF COURAGE AND DELIBERATION. IN SHORT YOU’RE ACTING TOO HASTILY.

A KNIGHT: IF YOU’RE NOT WITH US GO. BUT KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

CHEREA: I SUSPECT I’M WITH YOU. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE. NOT FOR THE SAME REASONS.

A VOICE: THAT’S ENOUGH IDLE TALK.

CHEREA [STANDING UP]: I AGREE. LET’S GET DOWN TO FACTS. BUT FIRST LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR. THOUGH I AM WITH YOU I’M NOT FOR YOU. THAT INDEED IS WHY I THINK YOU’RE GOING ABOUT IT THE WRONG WAY. YOU HAVEN’T TAKEN YOUR ENEMY’S MEASURE; THAT’S OBVIOUS SINCE YOU ATTRIBUTE PETTY MOTIVES TO HIM. BUT THERE’S NOTHING PETTY ABOUT CALIGULA AND YOU’RE RIDING FOR A FALL. YOU’D BE BETTER PLACED TO FIGHT HIM IF YOU WOULD TRY TO SEE HIM AS HE REALLY IS.

A VOICE: WE SEE HIM AS HE IS—A CRAZY TYRANT.

CHEREA: NO. WE’VE HAD EXPERIENCE OF MAD EMPERORS. BUT THIS ONE ISN’T MAD ENOUGH. AND WHAT I LOATHE IN HIM IS THIS: THAT HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.

FIRST PATRICIAN: AND WE TOO KNOW IT; HE WANTS TO MURDER US ALL.

CHEREA: YOU’RE WRONG. OUR DEATHS ARE ONLY A SIDE ISSUE. HE’S PUTTING HIS POWER AT THE SERVICE OF A LOFTIER DEADLIER PASSION; AND IT IMPERILS EVERYTHING WE HOLD MOST SACRED. TRUE IT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME ROME HAS SEEN A MAN WIELDING UNLIMITED POWER; BUT IT’S THE FIRST TIME HE SETS NO LIMIT TO HIS USE OF IT AND COUNTS MANKIND AND THE WORLD WE KNOW FOR NOTHING. THAT’S WHAT APPALLS ME IN CALIGULA; THAT’S WHAT I WANT TO FIGHT. TO LOSE ONE’S LIFE IS NO GREAT MATTER; WHEN THE TIME COMES I’LL HAVE THE COURAGE TO LOSE MINE. BUT WHAT’S INTOLERABLE IS TO SEE ONE’S LIFE BEING DRAINED OF MEANING TO BE TOLD THERE’S NO REASON FOR EXISTING. A MAN CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT SOME REASON FOR LIVING.

FIRST PATRICIAN: REVENGE IS A GOOD REASON.

CHEREA: YES AND I PROPOSE TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. BUT I’D HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IT’S NOT ON YOUR ACCOUNT OR TO HELP YOU TO AVENGE YOUR PETTY HUMILIATIONS. NO IF I JOIN FORCES WITH YOU IT’S TO COMBAT A BIG IDEA—AN IDEAL IF YOU LIKE—WHOSE TRIUMPH WOULD MEAN THE END OF EVERYTHING. I CAN ENDURE YOUR BEING MADE A MOCK OF BUT I CANNOT ENDURE CALIGULA’S CARRYING OUT HIS THEORIES TO THE END. HE IS CONVERTING HIS PHILOSOPHY INTO CORPSES AND—UNFORTUNATELY FOR US—IT’S A PHILOSOPHY THAT’S LOGICAL FROM START TO FINISH. AND WHERE ONE CAN’T REFUTE ONE STRIKES.

A VOICE: YES. WE MUST ACT.

CHEREA: WE MUST TAKE ACTION I AGREE. BUT A FRONTAL ATTACK’S QUITE USELESS WHEN ONE IS FIGHTING AN IMPERIAL MADMAN IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS POWER. YOU CAN TAKE ARMS AGAINST A VULGAR TYRANT BUT CUNNING IS NEEDED TO FIGHT DOWN DISINTERESTED MALICE. YOU CAN ONLY URGE IT ON TO FOLLOW ITS BENT AND BIDE YOUR TIME UNTIL ITS LOGIC FOUNDERS IN SHEER LUNACY. AS YOU SEE I PREFER TO BE QUITE FRANK AND I WARN YOU I’LL BE WITH YOU ONLY FOR A TIME. AFTERWARD I SHALL DO NOTHING TO ADVANCE YOUR INTERESTS; ALL I WISH IS TO REGAIN SOME PEACE OF MIND IN A WORLD THAT HAS REGAINED A MEANING. WHAT SPURS ME ON IS NOT AMBITION BUT FEAR MY VERY REASONABLE FEAR OF THAT INHUMAN VISION IN WHICH MY LIFE MEANS NO MORE THAN A SPECK OF DUST.

FIRST PATRICIAN [APPROACHING HIM]: I HAVE AN INKLING OF WHAT YOU MEAN CHEREA. ANYHOW THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU TOO FEEL THAT THE WHOLE FABRIC OF SOCIETY IS THREATENED. YOU GENTLEMEN AGREE WITH ME I TAKE IT THAT OUR RULING MOTIVE IS OF A MORAL ORDER. FAMILY LIFE IS BREAKING DOWN MEN ARE LOSING THEIR RESPECT FOR HONEST WORK A WAVE OF IMMORALITY IS SWEEPING THE COUNTRY. WHO OF US CAN BE DEAF TO THE APPEAL OF OUR ANCESTRAL PIETY IN ITS HOUR OF DANGER? FELLOW CONSPIRATORS WILL YOU TOLERATE A STATE OF THINGS IN WHICH PATRICIANS ARE FORCED TO RUN LIKE SLAVES BESIDE THE EMPEROR’S LITTER?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WILL YOU ALLOW THEM TO BE ADDRESSED AS “DARLING”?

A VOICE: AND HAVE THEIR WIVES SNATCHED FROM THEM?

ANOTHER VOICE: AND THEIR MONEY?

ALL TOGETHER: NO!

FIRST PATRICIAN: CHEREA YOUR ADVISE IS GOOD AND YOU DID WELL TO CALM OUR PASSION. THE TIME IS NOT YET RIPE FOR ACTION; THE MASSES WOULD STILL BE AGAINST US. WILL YOU JOIN US IN WATCHING FOR THE BEST MOMENT TO STRIKE—AND STRIKE HARD?

CHEREA: YES—AND MEANWHILE LET CALIGULA FOLLOW HIS DREAM. OR RATHER LET’S ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE HIM TO CARRY OUT HIS WILDEST PLANS. LET’S PUT METHOD INTO HIS MADNESS. AND THEN AT LAST A DAY WILL COME WHEN HE’S ALONE A LONELY MAN IN AN EMPIRE OF THE DEAD AND KINSMEN OF THE DEAD.

[A GENERAL UPROAR. TRUMPET CALLS OUTSIDE. THEN SILENCE BUT FOR WHISPERS OF A NAME: “CALIGULA!” CALIGULA ENTERS WITH CÆSONIA FOLLOWED BY HELICON AND SOME SOLDIERS. PANTOMIME. CALIGULA HALTS AND GAZES AT THE CONSPIRATORS. WITHOUT A WORD HE MOVES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER STRAIGHTENS A BUCKLE ON ONE MAN’S SHOULDER STEPS BACK TO CONTEMPLATE ANOTHER SWEEPS THEM WITH HIS GAZE THEN DRAWS HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES AND WALKS OUT STILL WITHOUT A WORD.]

CÆSONIA [IRONICALLY POINTING TO THE DISORDER OF THE ROOM]: WERE YOU HAVING A FIGHT?

CHEREA: YES WE WERE FIGHTING.

CÆSONIA [IN THE SAME TONE]: REALLY? MIGHT I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE FIGHTING ABOUT?

CHEREA: ABOUT … NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.

CÆSONIA: AH? THEN IT ISN’T TRUE.

CHEREA: WHAT ISN’T TRUE?

CÆSONIA: YOU WERE NOT FIGHTING.

CHEREA: HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY. WE WEREN’T FIGHTING.

CÆSONIA [SMILING]: PERHAPS YOU’D DO BETTER TO TIDY UP THE PLACE. CALIGULA HATES UNTIDINESS.

HELICON [TO THE OLD PATRICIAN]: YOU’LL END BY MAKING HIM DO SOMETHING OUT OF CHARACTER.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: PARDON … I DON’T FOLLOW. WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO HIM?

HELICON: NOTHING. JUST NOTHING. IT’S FANTASTIC BEING FUTILE TO THAT POINT; ENOUGH TO GET ON ANYBODY’S NERVES. TRY TO PUT YOURSELVES IN CALIGULA’S PLACE. [A SHORT PAUSE.] I SEE; DOING A BIT OF PLOTTING WEREN’T YOU NOW?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: REALLY THAT’S TOO ABSURD. I HOPE CALIGULA DOESN’T IMAGINE …

HELICON: HE DOESN’T IMAGINE. HE KNOWS. BUT I SUPPOSE AT BOTTOM HE RATHER WANTS IT.… WELL WE’D BETTER SET TO TIDYING UP.

[ALL GET BUSY. CALIGULA ENTERS AND WATCHES THEM.]

CALIGULA [TO THE OLD PATRICIAN]: GOOD DAY DARLING. [TO THE OTHERS] GENTLEMEN I’M ON MY WAY TO AN EXECUTION. BUT I THOUGHT I’D DROP IN AT YOUR PLACE CHEREA FOR A LIGHT MEAL. I’VE GIVEN ORDERS TO HAVE FOOD BROUGHT HERE FOR ALL OF US. BUT SEND FOR YOUR WIVES FIRST. [A SHORT SILENCE.] RUFIUS SHOULD THANK HIS STARS THAT I’VE BEEN SEIZED WITH HUNGER. [CONFIDENTIALLY] RUFIUS I MAY TELL YOU IS THE KNIGHT WHO’S GOING TO BE EXECUTED. [ANOTHER SHORT SILENCE.] WHAT’S THIS? NONE OF YOU ASKS ME WHY I’VE SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH? [NO ONE SPEAKS. MEANWHILE SLAVES LAY THE TABLE AND BRING FOOD.] GOOD FOR YOU! I SEE YOU’RE GROWING QUITE INTELLIGENT. [HE NIBBLES AN OLIVE.] IT HAS DAWNED ON YOU THAT A MAN NEEDN’T HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR HIM TO DIE. [HE STOPS EATING AND GAZES AT HIS GUESTS WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE.] SOLDIERS I AM PROUD OF YOU. [THREE OR FOUR WOMEN ENTER.] GOOD! LET’S TAKE OUR PLACES. ANYHOW. NO ORDER OF PRECEDENCE TODAY. [ALL ARE SEATED.] THERE’S NO DENYING IT THAT FELLOW RUFIUS IS IN LUCK. BUT I WONDER IF HE APPRECIATES THIS SHORT REPRIEVE. A FEW HOURS GAINED ON DEATH WHY THEY’RE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD! [HE BEGINS EATING; THE OTHERS FOLLOW SUIT. IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT CALIGULA’S TABLE MANNERS ARE DEPLORABLE. THERE IS NO NEED FOR HIM TO FLICK HIS OLIVE STONES ONTO HIS NEIGHBORS’ PLATES OR TO SPIT OUT BITS OF GRISTLE OVER THE DISH OR TO PICK HIS TEETH WITH HIS NAILS OR TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY. HOWEVER HE INDULGES IN THESE PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE MEAL WITHOUT THE LEAST COMPUNCTION. AT ONE MOMENT HE STOPS EATING STARES AT LEPIDUS ONE OF THE GUESTS AND SAYS ROUGHLY] YOU’RE LOOKING GRUMPY LEPIDUS. I WONDER CAN IT BE BECAUSE I HAD YOUR SON KILLED?

LEPIDUS [THICKLY]: CERTAINLY NOT CAIUS. QUITE THE CONTRARY.

CALIGULA [BEAMING AT HIM]: “QUITE THE CONTRARY!” IT’S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE A FACE THAT HIDES THE SECRETS OF THE HEART. YOUR FACE IS SAD. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR HEART? QUITE THE CONTRARY—ISN’T THAT SO LEPIDUS?

LEPIDUS [DOGGEDLY]: QUITE THE CONTRARY CÆSAR.

CALIGULA [MORE AND MORE ENJOYING THE SITUATION]: REALLY LEPIDUS THERE’S NO ONE I LIKE BETTER THAN YOU. NOW LET’S HAVE A LAUGH TOGETHER MY DEAR FRIEND. TELL ME A FUNNY STORY.

LEPIDUS [WHO HAS OVERRATED HIS ENDURANCE]: PLEASE …

CALIGULA: GOOD! VERY GOOD! THEN IT’S I WHO’LL TELL THE STORY. BUT YOU’LL LAUGH WON’T YOU LEPIDUS? [WITH A GLINT OF MALICE.] IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR OTHER SON. [SMILING AGAIN.] IN ANY CASE AS YOU’VE JUST TOLD US YOU’RE NOT IN A BAD HUMOR. [HE TAKES A DRINK THEN SAYS IN THE TONE OF A TEACHER PROMPTING A PUPIL] QUITE … QUITE THE …

LEPIDUS [WEARILY]: QUITE THE CONTRARY CÆSAR.

CALIGULA: SPLENDID! [DRINKS AGAIN.] NOW LISTEN. [IN A GENTLE FARAWAY TONE] ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR YOUNG EMPEROR WHOM NOBODY LOVED. HE LOVED LEPIDUS AND TO ROOT OUT OF HIS HEART HIS LOVE FOR LEPIDUS HE HAD HIS YOUNGEST SON KILLED. [IN A BRISKER TONE] NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE’S NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT. STILL IT’S A FUNNY STORY EH? BUT YOU’RE NOT LAUGHING. NOBODY’S LAUGHING. NOW LISTEN! [IN A BURST OF ANGER] I INSIST ON EVERYBODY’S LAUGHING. YOU LEPIDUS SHALL LEAD THE CHORUS. STAND UP EVERY ONE OF YOU AND LAUGH. [HE THUMPS THE TABLE.] DO YOU HEAR WHAT I SAY? I WISH TO SEE YOU LAUGHING ALL OF YOU. [ALL RISE TO THEIR FEET. DURING THIS SCENE ALL THE PLAYERS CALIGULA AND CÆSONIA EXCEPTED BEHAVE LIKE MARIONETTES IN A PUPPET PLAY. CALIGULA SINKS BACK ON HIS COUCH BEAMING WITH DELIGHT AND BURSTS INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER.] OH CÆSONIA! JUST LOOK AT THEM! THE GAME IS UP; HONOR RESPECTABILITY THE WISDOM OF THE NATIONS GONE WITH THE WIND! THE WIND OF FEAR HAS BLOWN THEM ALL AWAY. FEAR CÆSONIA—DON’T YOU AGREE?—IS A NOBLE EMOTION PURE AND SIMPLE SELF-SUFFICIENT LIKE NO OTHER; IT DRAWS ITS PATENT OF NOBILITY STRAIGHT FROM THE GUTS. [HE STROKES HIS FOREHEAD AND DRINKS AGAIN. IN A FRIENDLY TONE] WELL WELL LET’S CHANGE THE SUBJECT. WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CHEREA? YOU’VE BEEN VERY SILENT.

CHEREA: I’M QUITE READY TO SPEAK CAIUS. WHEN YOU GIVE ME LEAVE.

CALIGULA: EXCELLENT. THEN—KEEP SILENT. I’D RATHER HAVE A WORD FROM OUR FRIEND MUCIUS.

MUCIUS [RELUCTANTLY]: AS YOU WILL CAIUS.

CALIGULA: THEN TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR WIFE. AND BEGIN BY SENDING HER TO THIS PLACE ON MY RIGHT. [MUCIUS’ WIFE SEATS HERSELF BESIDE CALIGULA.] WELL MUCIUS? WE’RE WAITING.

MUCIUS [HARDLY KNOWING WHAT HE SAYS]: MY WIFE … BUT … I’M VERY FOND OF HER.

[GENERAL LAUGHTER.]

CALIGULA: WHY OF COURSE MY FRIEND OF COURSE. BUT HOW ORDINARY OF YOU! SO UNORIGINAL! [HE IS LEANING TOWARD HER TICKLING HER SHOULDER PLAYFULLY WITH HIS TONGUE.] BY THE WAY WHEN I CAME IN JUST NOW YOU WERE HATCHING A PLOT WEREN’T YOU? A NICE BLOODY LITTLE PLOT?

OLD PATRICIAN: OH CAIUS HOW CAN YOU …?

CALIGULA: IT DOESN’T MATTER IN THE LEAST MY PET. OLD AGE WILL BE SERVED. I WON’T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. NOT ONE OF YOU HAS THE SPUNK FOR AN HEROIC ACT.… AH IT’S JUST COME TO MY MIND I HAVE SOME AFFAIRS OF STATE TO SETTLE. BUT FIRST LET THE IMPERIOUS DESIRES THAT NATURE CREATES IN US HAVE THEIR WAY.
[HE RISES AND LEADS MUCIUS’ WIFE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM. MUCIUS STARTS UP FROM HIS SEAT.]

CÆSONIA [AMIABLY]: PLEASE MUCIUS. WILL YOU POUR ME OUT ANOTHER GLASS OF THIS EXCELLENT WINE. [MUCIUS COMPLIES; HIS MOVEMENT OF REVOLT IS QUELLED. EVERYONE LOOKS EMBARRASSED. CHAIRS CREAK NOISILY. THE ENSUING CONVERSATION IS IN A STRAINED TONE. CÆSONIA TURNS TO CHEREA.] NOW CHEREA SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME WHY YOU PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING JUST NOW?

CHEREA [COOLLY]: WITH PLEASURE MY DEAR CÆSONIA. OUR QUARREL AROSE FROM A DISCUSSION WHETHER POETRY SHOULD BE BLOODTHIRSTY OR NOT.

CÆSONIA: AN INTERESTING PROBLEM. SOMEWHAT BEYOND MY FEMININE COMPREHENSION OF COURSE. STILL IT SURPRISES ME THAT YOUR PASSION FOR ART SHOULD MAKE YOU COME TO BLOWS.

CHEREA [IN THE SAME RATHER STILTED TONE]: THAT I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND. BUT I REMEMBER CALIGULA’S TELLING ME THE OTHER DAY THAT ALL TRUE PASSION HAS A SPICE OF CRUELTY.

CÆSONIA [HELPING HERSELF FROM THE DISH IN FRONT OF HER]: THERE’S TRUTH IN THAT. DON’T YOU AGREE GENTLEMEN?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: AH YES. CALIGULA HAS A RARE INSIGHT INTO THE SECRET PLACES OF THE HEART.

FIRST PATRICIAN: AND HOW ELOQUENTLY HE SPOKE JUST NOW OF COURAGE!

SECOND PATRICIAN: REALLY HE SHOULD PUT HIS IDEAS INTO WRITING. THEY WOULD BE MOST INSTRUCTIVE.

CHEREA: AND WHAT’S MORE IT WOULD KEEP HIM BUSY. IT’S OBVIOUS HE NEEDS SOMETHING TO OCCUPY HIS LEISURE.

CÆSONIA [STILL EATING]: YOU’LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT CALIGULA SHARES YOUR VIEWS; HE’S WORKING ON A BOOK. QUITE A BIG ONE I BELIEVE.

[CALIGULA ENTERS ACCOMPANIED BY MUCIUS’ WIFE.]

CALIGULA: MUCIUS I RETURN YOUR WIFE WITH MANY THANKS. BUT EXCUSE ME I’VE SOME ORDERS TO GIVE.

[HE HURRIES OUT. MUCIUS HAS GONE PALE AND RISEN TO HIS FEET.]

CÆSONIA [TO MUCIUS WHO IS STANDING]: THIS BOOK OF HIS WILL CERTAINLY RANK AMONG OUR LATIN CLASSICS. ARE YOU LISTENING MUCIUS?

MUCIUS [HIS EYES STILL FIXED ON THE DOOR BY WHICH CALIGULA WENT OUT]: YES. AND WHAT’S THE BOOK ABOUT CÆSONIA?

CÆSONIA [INDIFFERENTLY]: OH IT’S ABOVE MY HEAD YOU KNOW.

CHEREA: MAY WE ASSUME IT DEALS WITH THE MURDEROUS POWER OF POETRY?

CÆSONIA: YES SOMETHING OF THAT SORT I UNDERSTAND.

THE OLD PATRICIAN [CHEERFULLY]: WELL ANYHOW AS OUR FRIEND CHEREA SAID IT WILL KEEP HIM BUSY.

CÆSONIA: YES MY LOVE. BUT I’M AFRAID THERE’S ONE THING YOU WON’T LIKE QUITE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS BOOK AND THAT’S ITS TITLE.

CHEREA: WHAT IS IT?

CÆSONIA: COLD STEEL.

[CALIGULA HURRIES IN.]

CALIGULA: EXCUSE ME BUT I’VE SOME URGENT PUBLIC WORK IN HAND. [TO THE INTENDANT] INTENDANT YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC GRANARIES. I HAVE SIGNED A DECREE TO THAT EFFECT; YOU WILL FIND IT IN MY STUDY.

INTENDANT: BUT SIRE …

CALIGULA: FAMINE BEGINS TOMORROW.

INTENDANT: BUT … BUT HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN—PERHAPS A REVOLUTION.

CALIGULA [FIRMLY AND DELIBERATELY]: I REPEAT; FAMINE BEGINS TOMORROW. WE ALL KNOW WHAT FAMINE MEANS—A NATIONAL CATASTROPHE. WELL TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A CATASTROPHE AND I SHALL END IT WHEN I CHOOSE. AFTER ALL I HAVEN’T SO MANY WAYS OF PROVING I AM FREE. ONE IS ALWAYS FREE AT SOMEONE ELSE’S EXPENSE. ABSURD PERHAPS BUT SO IT IS. [WITH A KEEN GLANCE AT MUCIUS] APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE TO YOUR JEALOUSY—AND YOU’LL UNDERSTAND BETTER. [IN A MEDITATIVE TONE] STILL WHAT AN UGLY THING IS JEALOUSY! A DISEASE OF VANITY AND THE IMAGINATION. ONE PICTURES ONE’S WIFE.… [MUCIUS CLENCHES HIS FISTS AND OPENS HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK. BEFORE HE CAN GET A WORD OUT CALIGULA CUTS IN] NOW GENTLEMEN LET’S GO ON WITH OUR MEAL.… DO YOU KNOW WE’VE BEEN DOING QUITE A LOT OF WORK WITH HELICON’S ASSISTANCE? PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES TO A LITTLE MONOGRAPH ON EXECUTION—ABOUT WHICH YOU WILL HAVE MUCH TO SAY.

HELICON: ASSUMING WE ASK YOUR OPINION.

CALIGULA: WHY NOT BE GENEROUS HELICON AND LET THEM INTO OUR LITTLE SECRETS? COME NOW GIVE THEM A SAMPLE. SECTION THREE FIRST PARAGRAPH.

HELICON [STANDING DECLAIMS IN A DRONING VOICE]: “EXECUTION RELIEVES AND LIBERATES. IT IS UNIVERSAL TONIC JUST IN PRECEPT AND IN PRACTICE. A MAN DIES BECAUSE HE IS GUILTY. A MAN IS GUILTY BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF CALIGULA’S SUBJECTS. NOW ALL MEN ARE CALIGULA’S SUBJECTS. ERGO ALL MEN ARE GUILTY AND SHALL DIE. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME AND PATIENCE.”

CALIGULA [LAUGHING]: THERE’S LOGIC FOR YOU DON’T YOU AGREE? THAT BIT ABOUT PATIENCE WAS RATHER NEAT WASN’T IT? ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU THAT’S THE QUALITY I MOST ADMIRE IN YOU … YOUR PATIENCE. NOW GENTLEMEN YOU CAN DISPERSE. CHEREA DOESN’T NEED YOUR PRESENCE ANY LONGER. CÆSONIA I WISH YOU TO STAY. YOU TOO LEPIDUS. ALSO OUR OLD FRIEND MEREIA. I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR NATIONAL BROTHEL. IT’S NOT FUNCTIONING TOO WELL; IN FACT I’M QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

[THE OTHERS FILE OUT SLOWLY. CALIGULA FOLLOWS MUCIUS WITH HIS EYES.]

CHEREA: AT YOUR ORDERS CAIUS. BUT WHAT’S THE TROUBLE? ARE THE STAFF UNSATISFACTORY?

CALIGULA: NO BUT THE TAKINGS ARE FALLING OFF.

MEREIA: THEN YOU SHOULD RAISE THE ENTRANCE FEE.

CALIGULA: THERE MEREIA YOU MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY OF KEEPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT. YOU’RE TOO OLD TO BE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT AND I DON’T WANT YOUR OPINION.

MEREIA: THEN WHY ASK ME TO STAY?

CALIGULA: BECAUSE PRESENTLY I MAY REQUIRE SOME COOL DISPASSIONATE ADVICE.

[MEREIA MOVES AWAY.]

CHEREA: IF YOU WISH TO HEAR MY VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT CAIUS I’D SAY NEITHER COOLLY NOR DISPASSIONATELY THAT IT WOULD BE A BLUNDER TO RAISE THE SCALE OF CHARGES.

CALIGULA: OBVIOUSLY. WHAT’S NEEDED IS A BIGGER TURNOVER. I’VE EXPLAINED MY PLAN OF CAMPAIGN TO CÆSONIA AND SHE WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. AS FOR ME I’VE HAD TOO MUCH WINE I’M FEELING SLEEPY.

[HE LIES DOWN AND CLOSES HIS EYES.]

CÆSONIA: IT’S VERY SIMPLE. CALIGULA IS CREATING A NEW ORDER OF MERIT.

CHEREA: SORRY I DON’T SEE THE CONNECTION.

CÆSONIA: NO? BUT THERE IS ONE. IT WILL BE CALLED THE BADGE OF CIVIC MERIT AND AWARDED TO THOSE WHO HAVE PATRONIZED CALIGULA’S NATIONAL BROTHEL MOST ASSIDUOUSLY.

CHEREA: A BRILLIANT IDEA!

CÆSONIA: I AGREE. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THE BADGE WILL BE CONFERRED EACH MONTH AFTER CHECKING THE ADMISSION TICKETS. ANY CITIZEN WHO HAS NOT OBTAINED THE BADGE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS WILL BE EXILED OR EXECUTED.

CHEREA: WHY “OR EXECUTED”?

CÆSONIA: BECAUSE CALIGULA SAYS IT DOESN’T MATTER WHICH—BUT IT’S IMPORTANT HE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT OF CHOOSING.

CHEREA: BRAVO! THE PUBLIC TREASURY WILL WIPE OUT ITS DEFICIT IN NO TIME

     [CALIGULA HAS HALF OPENED HIS EYES AND IS WATCHING OLD MEREIA WHO STANDING IN A CORNER HAS PRODUCED A SMALL FLASK AND IS SIPPING ITS CONTENTS.]

CALIGULA [STILL LYING ON THE COUCH]: WHAT’S THAT YOU’RE DRINKING MEREIA?

MEREIA: IT’S FOR MY ASTHMA CAIUS.

CALIGULA [RISES AND THRUSTING THE OTHERS ASIDE GOES UP TO MEREIA AND SNIFFS HIS MOUTH]: NO IT’S AN ANTIDOTE.

MEREIA: WHAT AN IDEA CAIUS! YOU MUST BE JOKING. I HAVE CHOKING FITS AT NIGHT AND I’VE BEEN IN THE DOCTOR’S HANDS FOR MONTHS.

CALIGULA: SO YOU’RE AFRAID OF BEING POISONED?

MEREIA: MY ASTHMA …

CALIGULA: NO. WHY BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH? YOU’RE AFRAID I’LL POISON YOU. YOU SUSPECT ME. YOU’RE KEEPING AN EYE ON ME.

MEREIA: GOOD HEAVENS NO!

CALIGULA: YOU SUSPECT ME. I’M NOT TO BE TRUSTED EH?

MEREIA: CAIUS!

CALIGULA [ROUGHLY]: ANSWER! [IN A COOL JUDICIAL TONE] IF YOU TAKE AN ANTIDOTE IT FOLLOWS THAT YOU CREDIT ME WITH THE INTENTION OF POISONING YOU. Q.E.D.

MEREIA: YES … I MEAN … NO!

CALIGULA: AND THINKING I INTEND TO POISON YOU YOU TAKE STEPS TO FRUSTRATE MY PLAN. [HE FALLS SILENT. MEANWHILE CÆSONIA AND CHEREA HAVE MOVED AWAY BACKSTAGE. LEPIDUS IS WATCHING THE SPEAKERS WITH AN AIR OF CONSTERNATION.] THAT MAKES TWO CRIMES MEREIA AND A DILEMMA FROM WHICH YOU CAN’T ESCAPE. EITHER I HAVE NO WISH TO CAUSE YOUR DEATH; IN WHICH CASE YOU ARE UNJUSTLY SUSPECTING ME YOUR EMPEROR. OR ELSE I DESIRE YOUR DEATH; IN WHICH CASE VERMIN THAT YOU ARE YOU’RE TRYING TO THWART MY WILL. [ANOTHER SILENCE. CALIGULA CONTEMPLATES THE OLD MAN GLOATINGLY.] WELL MEREIA WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO MY LOGIC?

MEREIA: IT … IT’S SOUND ENOUGH CAIUS. ONLY IT DOESN’T APPLY TO THE CASE.

CALIGULA: A THIRD CRIME. YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL. NOW SIT DOWN AND LISTEN CAREFULLY. [TO LEPIDUS] LET EVERYONE SIT DOWN. [TO MEREIA] OF THESE THREE CRIMES ONLY ONE DOES YOU HONOR; THE SECOND ONE—BECAUSE BY CREDITING ME WITH A CERTAIN WISH AND PRESUMING TO OPPOSE IT YOU ARE DELIBERATELY DEFYING ME. YOU ARE A REBEL A LEADER OF REVOLT. AND THAT NEEDS COURAGE. [SADLY] I’VE A GREAT LIKING FOR YOU MEREIA. AND THAT IS WHY YOU’LL BE CONDEMNED FOR CRIME NUMBER TWO AND NOT FOR EITHER OF THE OTHERS. YOU SHALL DIE NOBLY A REBEL’S DEATH. [WHILE HE TALKS MEREIA IS SHRINKING TOGETHER ON HIS CHAIR.] DON’T THANK ME. IT’S QUITE NATURAL. HERE. [HOLDS OUT A PHIAL. HIS TONE IS AMIABLE.] DRINK THIS POISON. [MEREIA SHAKES HIS HEAD. HE IS SOBBING VIOLENTLY. CALIGULA SHOWS SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE.] DON’T WASTE TIME. TAKE IT. [MEREIA MAKES A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. BUT CALIGULA WITH A WILD LEAP IS ON HIM CATCHES HIM IN THE CENTER OF THE STAGE AND AFTER A BRIEF STRUGGLE PINS HIM DOWN ON A LOW COUCH. HE FORCES THE PHIAL BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND SMASHES IT WITH A BLOW OF HIS FIST. AFTER SOME CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS MEREIA DIES. HIS FACE IS STREAMING WITH BLOOD AND TEARS. CALIGULA RISES WIPES HIS HANDS ABSENT-MINDEDLY THEN HANDS MEREIA’S FLASK TO CÆSONIA.] WHAT WAS IT? AN ANTIDOTE?

CÆSONIA [CALMLY]: NO CALIGULA. A REMEDY FOR ASTHMA.

[A SHORT SILENCE.]

CALIGULA [GAZING DOWN AT MEREIA]: NO MATTER. IT ALL COMES TO THE SAME THING IN THE END. A LITTLE SOONER A LITTLE LATER.…

[HE GOES OUT HURRIEDLY STILL WIPING HIS HANDS.]

LEPIDUS [IN A HORRIFIED TONE]: WHAT … WHAT SHALL WE DO?

CÆSONIA [COOLLY]: REMOVE THAT BODY TO BEGIN WITH I SHOULD SAY. IT’S RATHER A BEASTLY SIGHT.

[CHEREA AND LEPIDUS DRAG THE BODY INTO THE WINGS.]

LEPIDUS [TO CHEREA]: WE MUST ACT QUICKLY.

CHEREA: WE’LL NEED TO BE TWO HUNDRED.

[YOUNG SCIPIO ENTERS. SEEING CÆSONIA HE MAKES AS IF TO LEAVE.]

CÆSONIA: COME.

SCIPIO: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

CÆSONIA: COME NEARER. [SHE PUSHES UP HIS CHIN AND LOOKS HIM IN THE EYES. A SHORT SILENCE. THEN IN A CALM UNEMOTIONAL VOICE] HE KILLED YOUR FATHER DIDN’T HE?

SCIPIO: YES.

CÆSONIA: DO YOU HATE HIM?

SCIPIO: YES.

CÆSONIA: AND YOU’D LIKE TO KILL HIM?

SCIPIO: YES.

CÆSONIA [WITHDRAWING HER HAND]: BUT—WHY TELL ME THIS?

SCIPIO: BECAUSE I FEAR NOBODY. KILLING HIM OR BEING KILLED—EITHER WAY OUT WILL DO. AND ANYHOW YOU WON’T BETRAY ME.

CÆSONIA: THAT’S SO. I WON’T BETRAY YOU. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING—OR RATHER I’D LIKE TO SPEAK TO WHAT IS BEST IN YOU.

SCIPIO: WHAT’S BEST IN ME IS—MY HATRED.

CÆSONIA: PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY TO WHAT I’M GOING TO SAY. IT MAY SOUND HARD TO GRASP BUT IT’S AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT REALLY. AND IT’S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT THE ONE REAL REVOLUTION IN THIS WORLD OF OURS IF PEOPLE WOULD ONLY TAKE IT IN.

SCIPIO: YES? WHAT IS IT?

CÆSONIA: WAIT! TRY TO CALL UP A PICTURE OF YOUR FATHER’S DEATH OF THE AGONY ON HIS FACE AS THEY WERE TEARING OUT HIS TONGUE. THINK OF THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM HIS MOUTH AND RECALL HIS SCREAMS LIKE A TORTURED ANIMAL’S.

SCIPIO: YES.

CÆSONIA: AND NOW THINK OF CALIGULA.

SCIPIO [HIS VOICE ROUGH WITH HATRED]: YES.

CÆSONIA: NOW LISTEN. TRY TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

[SHE GOES OUT LEAVING SCIPIO GAPING AFTER HER IN BEWILDERMENT. HELICON ENTERS.]

HELICON: CALIGULA WILL BE HERE IN A MOMENT. SUPPOSE YOU GO FOR YOUR MEAL YOUNG POET?

SCIPIO: HELICON HELP ME.

HELICON: TOO DANGEROUS MY LAMB. AND POETRY MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

SCIPIO: YOU CAN HELP ME. YOU KNOW … SO MANY THINGS.

HELICON: I KNOW THAT THE DAYS GO BY—AND GROWING BOYS SHOULD HAVE THEIR MEALS ON TIME … I KNOW TOO THAT YOU COULD KILL CALIGULA … AND HE WOULDN’T GREATLY MIND IT.

[HELICON GOES OUT. CALIGULA ENTERS.]

CALIGULA: AH IT’S YOU SCIPIO. [HE PAUSES. ONE HAS THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED.] IT’S QUITE A LONG TIME SINCE I SAW YOU LAST. [SLOWLY APPROACHES SCIPIO.] WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO? WRITING MORE POEMS I SUPPOSE. MIGHT I SEE YOUR LATEST COMPOSITION?

SCIPIO [LIKEWISE ILL AT EASE TORN BETWEEN HATRED AND SOME LESS DEFINED EMOTION]: YES CÆSAR I’VE WRITTEN SOME MORE POEMS.

CALIGULA: ON WHAT SUBJECT?

SCIPIO: OH ON NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. WELL ON NATURE IN A WAY.

CALIGULA: A FINE THEME. AND A VAST ONE. AND WHAT HAS NATURE DONE FOR YOU?

SCIPIO [PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER IN A SOMEWHAT TRUCULENT TONE]: IT CONSOLES ME FOR NOT BEING CÆSAR.

CALIGULA: REALLY? AND DO YOU THINK NATURE COULD CONSOLE ME FOR BEING CÆSAR?

SCIPIO [IN THE SAME TONE]: WHY NOT? NATURE HAS HEALED WORSE WOUNDS THAN THAT.

CALIGULA [IN A CURIOUSLY YOUNG UNAFFECTED VOICE]: WOUNDS YOU SAID? THERE WAS ANGER IN YOUR VOICE. BECAUSE I PUT YOUR FATHER TO DEATH?… THAT WORD YOU USED—IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW APT IT IS! MY WOUNDS! [IN A DIFFERENT TONE] WELL WELL THERE’S NOTHING LIKE HATRED FOR DEVELOPING THE INTELLIGENCE.

SCIPIO [STIFFLY]: I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION ABOUT NATURE.

   [CALIGULA SITS DOWN GAZES AT SCIPIO THEN BRUSQUELY GRIPS HIS WRISTS AND FORCES HIM TO STAND UP. HE TAKES THE YOUNG MAN’S FACE BETWEEN HIS HANDS.]

CALIGULA: RECITE YOUR POEM TO ME PLEASE.

SCIPIO: NO PLEASE DON’T ASK ME THAT.

CALIGULA: WHY NOT?

SCIPIO: I HAVEN’T GOT IT ON ME.

CALIGULA: CAN’T YOU REMEMBER IT?

SCIPIO: NO.

CALIGULA: ANYHOW YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT IT’S ABOUT.

SCIPIO [STILL HOSTILE; RELUCTANTLY]: I SPOKE OF A … A CERTAIN HARMONY …

CALIGULA [BREAKING IN; IN A PENSIVE VOICE]:… BETWEEN ONE’S FEET AND THE EARTH.

SCIPIO [LOOKING SURPRISED]: YES IT’S ALMOST THAT … AND IT TELLS OF THE WAVY OUTLINE OF THE ROMAN HILLS AND THE SUDDEN THRILL OF PEACE THAT TWILIGHT BRINGS TO THEM …

CALIGULA: AND THE CRIES OF SWIFTS WINDING THROUGH THE GREEN DUSK.

SCIPIO [YIELDING MORE AND MORE TO HIS EMOTION]: YES YES! AND THAT FANTASTIC MOMENT WHEN THE SKY ALL FLUSHED WITH RED AND GOLD SWINGS ROUND AND SHOWS ITS OTHER SIDE SPANGLED WITH STARS.

CALIGULA: AND THE FAINT SMELL OF SMOKE AND TREES AND STREAMS THAT MINGLES WITH THE RISING MIST.

SCIPIO [IN A SORT OF ECSTASY]: YES AND THE CHIRR OF CRICKETS THE COOLNESS VEINING THE WARM AIR THE RUMBLE OF CARTS AND THE FARMERS’ SHOUTS DOGS BARKING …

CALIGULA: AND THE ROADS DROWNED IN SHADOW WINDING THROUGH THE OLIVE GROVES …

SCIPIO: YES YES. THAT’S IT EXACTLY.… BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW?

CALIGULA [DRAWING SCIPIO TO HIS BREAST]: I WONDER! PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SAME ETERNAL TRUTHS APPEAL TO US BOTH.

SCIPIO [QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT BURYING HIS HEAD ON CALIGULA’S BREAST]: ANYHOW WHAT DOES IT MATTER! ALL I KNOW IS THAT EVERYTHING I FEEL OR THINK OF TURNS TO LOVE.

CALIGULA [STROKING HIS HAIR]: THAT SCIPIO IS A PRIVILEGE OF NOBLE HEARTS—AND HOW I WISH I COULD SHARE YOUR … YOUR LIMPIDITY! BUT MY APPETITE FOR LIFE’S TOO KEEN; NATURE CAN NEVER SATE IT. YOU BELONG TO QUITE ANOTHER WORLD AND YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE SINGLE-MINDED FOR GOOD; AND I AM SINGLE-MINDED—FOR EVIL.

SCIPIO: I DO UNDERSTAND.

CALIGULA: NO. THERE’S SOMETHING DEEP DOWN IN ME—AN ABYSS OF SILENCE A POOL OF STAGNANT WATER ROTTING WEEDS. [WITH AN ABRUPT CHANGE OF MANNER] YOUR POEM SOUNDS VERY GOOD INDEED BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT MY OPINION.…

SCIPIO [HIS HEAD ON CALIGULA’S BREAST MURMURS]: YES?

CALIGULA: ALL THAT’S A BIT … ANEMIC.

SCIPIO [RECOILING ABRUPTLY AS IF STUNG BY A SERPENT AND GAZING HORRIFIED AT CALIGULA HE CRIES HOARSELY]: OH YOU BRUTE! YOU LOATHSOME BRUTE! YOU’VE FOOLED ME AGAIN. I KNOW! YOU WERE PLAYING A TRICK ON ME WEREN’T YOU? AND NOW YOU’RE GLOATING OVER YOUR SUCCESS.

CALIGULA [WITH A HINT OF SADNESS]: THERE’S TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY. I WAS PLAYING A PART.

SCIPIO [IN THE SAME INDIGNANT TONE]: WHAT A FOUL BLACK HEART YOU HAVE! AND HOW ALL THAT WICKEDNESS AND HATRED MUST MAKE YOU SUFFER!

CALIGULA [GENTLY]: THAT’S ENOUGH.

SCIPIO: HOW I LOATHE YOU! AND HOW I PITY YOU!

CALIGULA [ANGRILY]: ENOUGH I TELL YOU.

SCIPIO: AND HOW HORRIBLE A LONELINESS LIKE YOURS MUST BE!

CALIGULA [IN A RUSH OF ANGER GRIPPING THE BOY BY THE COLLAR AND SHAKING HIM]: LONELINESS! WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF IT? ONLY THE LONELINESS OF POETS AND WEAKLINGS. YOU PRATE OF LONELINESS BUT YOU DON’T REALIZE THAT ONE IS NEVER ALONE. ALWAYS WE ARE ATTENDED BY THE SAME LOAD OF THE FUTURE AND THE PAST. THOSE WE HAVE KILLED ARE ALWAYS WITH US. BUT THEY ARE NO GREAT TROUBLE. IT’S THOSE WE HAVE LOVED THOSE WHO LOVED US AND WHOM WE DID NOT LOVE; REGRETS DESIRES BITTERNESS AND SWEETNESS WHORES AND GODS THE CELESTIAL GANG! ALWAYS ALWAYS WITH US! [HE RELEASES SCIPIO AND MOVES BACK TO HIS FORMER PLACE.] ALONE! AH IF ONLY IN THIS LONELINESS THIS GHOUL-HAUNTED WILDERNESS OF MINE I COULD KNOW BUT FOR A MOMENT REAL SOLITUDE REAL SILENCE THE THROBBING STILLNESS OF A TREE! [SITTING DOWN IN AN ACCESS OF FATIGUE.] SOLITUDE? NO SCIPIO MINE IS FULL OF GNASHINGS OF TEETH HIDEOUS WITH JARRING SOUNDS AND VOICES. AND WHEN I AM WITH THE WOMEN I MAKE MINE AND DARKNESS FALLS ON US AND I THINK NOW MY BODY’S HAD ITS FILL THAT I CAN FEEL MYSELF MY OWN AT LAST POISED BETWEEN DEATH AND LIFE—AH THEN MY SOLITUDE IS FOULED BY THE STALE SMELL OF PLEASURE FROM THE WOMAN SPRAWLING AT MY SIDE.

[A LONG SILENCE. CALIGULA SEEMS WEARY AND DESPONDENT. SCIPIO MOVES BEHIND HIM AND APPROACHES HESITANTLY. HE SLOWLY STRETCHES OUT A HAND TOWARD HIM FROM BEHIND AND LAYS IT ON HIS SHOULDER. WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND CALIGULA PLACES HIS HAND ON SCIPIO’S.]

SCIPIO: ALL MEN HAVE A SECRET SOLACE. IT HELPS THEM TO ENDURE AND THEY TURN TO IT WHEN LIFE HAS WEARIED THEM BEYOND ENDURING.

CALIGULA: YES SCIPIO.

SCIPIO: HAVE YOU NOTHING OF THE KIND IN YOUR LIFE NO REFUGE NO MOOD THAT MAKES THE TEARS WELL UP NO CONSOLATION?

CALIGULA: YES I HAVE SOMETHING OF THE KIND.

SCIPIO: WHAT IS IT?

CALIGULA [VERY QUIETLY]: SCORN.

CURTAIN

ACT III
A ROOM IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE.

BEFORE THE CURTAIN RISES A RHYTHMIC CLASH OF CYMBALS AND THE THUDDING OF A DRUM HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THE STAGE AND WHEN IT GOES UP WE SEE A CURTAINED-OFF BOOTH WITH A SMALL PROSCENIUM IN FRONT SUCH AS STROLLING PLAYERS USE AT COUNTRY FAIRS. ON THE LITTLE STAGE ARE CÆSONIA AND HELICON FLANKED BY CYMBAL PLAYERS. SEATED ON BENCHES WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE AUDIENCE ARE SOME PATRICIANS AND YOUNG SCIPIO.

HELICON [IN THE TONE OF A SHOWMAN AT A FAIR]: WALK UP! WALK UP! [A CLASH OF CYMBALS.] ONCE MORE THE GODS HAVE COME TO EARTH. THEY HAVE ASSUMED THE HUMAN FORM OF OUR HEAVEN-BORN EMPEROR KNOWN TO MEN AS CALIGULA. DRAW NEAR MORTALS OF COMMON CLAY; A HOLY MIRACLE IS TAKING PLACE BEFORE YOUR EYES. BY A DIVINE DISPENSATION PECULIAR TO CALIGULA’S HALLOWED REIGN THE SECRETS OF THE GODS WILL BE REVEALED TO YOU. [CYMBALS.]

CÆSONIA: COME GENTLEMEN. COME AND ADORE HIM—AND DON’T FORGET TO GIVE YOUR ALMS. TODAY HEAVEN AND ITS MYSTERIES ARE ON SHOW AT A PRICE TO SUIT EVERY POCKET.

HELICON: FOR ALL TO SEE THE SECRETS OF OLYMPUS REVELATIONS IN HIGH PLACES FEATURING GODS IN UNDRESS THEIR LITTLE PLOTS AND PRANKS. STEP THIS WAY! THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR GODS! [CYMBALS.]

CÆSONIA: ADORE HIM AND GIVE YOUR ALMS. COME NEAR GENTLEMEN. THE SHOW’S BEGINNING.

[CYMBALS. SLAVES ARE PLACING VARIOUS OBJECTS ON THE PLATFORM.]

HELICON: AN EPOCH-MAKING REPRODUCTION OF THE LIFE CELESTIAL WARRANTED AUTHENTIC IN EVERY DETAIL. FOR THE FIRST TIME THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF THE GODS ARE PRESENTED TO THE ROMAN PUBLIC. YOU WILL RELISH OUR NOVEL BREATHTAKING EFFECTS: FLASHES OF LIGHTNING [SLAVES LIGHT GREEK FIRES] PEALS OF THUNDER [THEY ROLL A BARREL FILLED WITH STONES] THE DIVINE EVENT ON ITS TRIUMPHAL WAY. NOW WATCH WITH ALL YOUR EYES. [HE DRAWS ASIDE THE CURTAIN. GROTESQUELY ATTIRED AS VENUS CALIGULA BEAMS DOWN ON THEM FROM A PEDESTAL.]

CALIGULA [AMIABLY]: I’M VENUS TODAY.

CÆSONIA: NOW FOR THE ADORATION. BOW DOWN. [ALL BUT SCIPIO BEND THEIR HEADS.] AND REPEAT AFTER ME THE LITANY OF VENUS CALLED CALIGULA.

   “OUR LADY OF PANGS AND PLEASURES …”

THE PATRICIANS: “OUR LADY OF PANGS AND PLEASURES …”

CÆSONIA: “BORN OF THE WAVES BITTER AND BRIGHT WITH SEAFOAM …”

THE PATRICIANS: “BORN OF THE WAVES BITTER AND BRIGHT WITH SEAFOAM …”

CÆSONIA: “O QUEEN WHOSE GIFTS ARE LAUGHTER AND REGRETS …”

THE PATRICIANS: “O QUEEN WHOSE GIFTS ARE LAUGHTER AND REGRETS …”

CÆSONIA: “RANCORS AND RAPTURES …”

THE PATRICIANS: “RANCORS AND RAPTURES …”

CÆSONIA: “TEACH US THE INDIFFERENCE THAT KINDLES LOVE ANEW …”

THE PATRICIANS: “TEACH US THE INDIFFERENCE THAT KINDLES LOVE ANEW …”

CÆSONIA: “MAKE KNOWN TO US THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS WORLD—WHICH IS THAT IT HAS NONE …”

THE PATRICIANS: “MAKE KNOWN TO US THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS WORLD—WHICH IS THAT IT HAS NONE …”

CÆSONIA: “AND GRANT US STRENGTH TO LIVE UP TO THIS VERITY OF VERITIES.”

THE PATRICIANS: “AND GRANT US STRENGTH TO LIVE UP TO THIS VERITY OF VERITIES.”

CÆSONIA: NOW PAUSE.

THE PATRICIANS: NOW PAUSE.

CÆSONIA [AFTER A SHORT SILENCE]: “BESTOW YOUR GIFTS ON US AND SHED ON OUR FACES THE LIGHT OF YOUR IMPARTIAL CRUELTY YOUR WANTON HATRED; UNFOLD ABOVE OUR EYES YOUR ARMS LADEN WITH FLOWERS AND MURDERS …”

THE PATRICIANS: “… YOUR ARMS LADEN WITH FLOWERS AND MURDERS.”

CÆSONIA: “WELCOME YOUR WANDERING CHILDREN HOME TO THE BLEAK SANCTUARY OF YOUR HEARTLESS THANKLESS LOVE. GIVE US YOUR PASSIONS WITHOUT OBJECT YOUR GRIEFS DEVOID OF REASON YOUR RAPTURES THAT LEAD NOWHERE …”

THE PATRICIANS: “… YOUR RAPTURES THAT LEAD NOWHERE …”

CÆSONIA [RAISING HER VOICE]: “O QUEEN SO EMPTY YET SO ARDENT INHUMAN YET SO EARTHLY MAKE US DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF YOUR EQUIVALENCE AND SURFEIT US FOREVER IN THE BRACKISH DARKNESS OF YOUR HEART.”

THE PATRICIANS: “MAKE US DRUNK WITH THE WINE OF YOUR EQUIVALENCE AND SURFEIT US FOREVER IN THE BRACKISH DARKNESS OF YOUR HEART.” [WHEN THE PATRICIANS HAVE SAID THE LAST RESPONSE CALIGULA WHO UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN QUITE MOTIONLESS SNORTS AND RISES.]

CALIGULA [IN A STENTORIAN VOICE]: GRANTED MY CHILDREN. YOUR PRAYER IS HEARD. [HE SQUATS CROSS-LEGGED ON THE PEDESTAL. ONE BY ONE THE PATRICIANS MAKE OBEISANCE DEPOSIT THEIR ALMS AND LINE UP ON THE RIGHT. THE LAST IN HIS FLURRY FORGETS TO MAKE AN OFFERING. CALIGULA BOUNDS TO HIS FEET.] STEADY! STEADY ON! COME HERE MY LAD. WORSHIP’S VERY WELL BUT ALMSGIVING IS BETTER. THANK YOU. WE ARE APPEASED. AH IF THE GODS HAD NO WEALTH OTHER THAN THE LOVE YOU MORTALS GIVE THEM THEY’D BE AS POOR AS POOR CALIGULA. NOW GENTLEMEN YOU MAY GO AND SPREAD ABROAD THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THE MIRACLE YOU’VE BEEN ALLOWED TO WITNESS. YOU HAVE SEEN VENUS SEEN HER GODHEAD WITH YOUR FLESHLY EYES AND VENUS HERSELF HAS SPOKEN TO YOU. GO MOST FAVORED GENTLEMEN. [THE PATRICIANS BEGIN TO MOVE AWAY.] JUST A MOMENT. WHEN YOU LEAVE MIND YOU TAKE THE EXIT ON YOUR LEFT. I HAVE POSTED SENTRIES IN THE OTHERS WITH ORDERS TO KILL YOU.

[THE PATRICIANS FILE OUT HASTILY IN SOME DISORDER. THE SLAVES AND MUSICIANS LEAVE THE STAGE.]

HELICON [POINTING A THREATENING FINGER AT SCIPIO]: NAUGHTY BOY YOU’VE BEEN PLAYING THE ANARCHIST AGAIN.

SCIPIO [TO CALIGULA]: YOU SPOKE BLASPHEMY CAIUS.

CALIGULA: BLASPHEMY? WHAT’S THAT?

SCIPIO: YOU’RE BEFOULING HEAVEN AFTER BLOODYING THE EARTH.

HELICON: HOW THIS YOUNGSTER LOVES BIG WORDS!

[HE STRETCHES HIMSELF ON A COUCH.]

CÆSONIA [COMPOSEDLY]: YOU SHOULD WATCH YOUR TONGUE MY LAD. AT THIS MOMENT MEN ARE DYING IN ROME FOR SAYING MUCH LESS.

SCIPIO: MAYBE—BUT I’VE RESOLVED TO TELL CALIGULA THE TRUTH.

CÆSONIA: LISTEN TO HIM CALIGULA! THAT WAS THE ONE THING MISSING IN YOUR EMPIRE—A BOLD YOUNG MORALIST.

CALIGULA [GIVING SCIPIO A CURIOUS GLANCE]: DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN THE GODS SCIPIO?

SCIPIO: NO.

CALIGULA: THEN I FAIL TO FOLLOW. IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE WHY BE SO KEEN TO SCENT OUT BLASPHEMY?

SCIPIO: ONE MAY DENY SOMETHING WITHOUT FEELING CALLED ON TO BESMIRCH IT OR DEPRIVE OTHERS OF THE RIGHT OF BELIEVING IN IT.

CALIGULA: BUT THAT’S HUMILITY THE REAL THING UNLESS I’M MUCH MISTAKEN. AH MY DEAR SCIPIO HOW GLAD I AM ON YOUR BEHALF—AND A TRIFLE ENVIOUS TOO. HUMILITY’S THE ONE EMOTION I MAY NEVER FEEL.

SCIPIO: IT’S NOT I YOU’RE ENVIOUS OF; IT’S THE GODS.

CALIGULA: IF YOU DON’T MIND THAT WILL REMAIN OUR SECRET—THE GREAT ENIGMA OF OUR REIGN. REALLY YOU KNOW THERE’S ONLY ONE THING FOR WHICH I MIGHT BE BLAMED TODAY—AND THAT’S THIS SMALL ADVANCE I’VE MADE UPON THE PATH OF FREEDOM. FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES POWER THE RIVALRY OF THE GODS IS RATHER IRKSOME. WELL I’VE PROVED TO THESE IMAGINARY GODS THAT ANY MAN WITHOUT PREVIOUS TRAINING IF HE APPLIES HIS MIND TO IT CAN PLAY THEIR ABSURD PARTS TO PERFECTION.

SCIPIO: THAT CAIUS IS WHAT I MEANT BY BLASPHEMY.

CALIGULA: NO SCIPIO IT’S CLEAR-SIGHTEDNESS. I’VE MERELY REALIZED THAT THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY OF GETTING EVEN WITH THE GODS. ALL THAT’S NEEDED IS TO BE AS CRUEL AS THEY.

SCIPIO: ALL THAT’S NEEDED IS TO PLAY THE TYRANT.

CALIGULA: TELL ME MY YOUNG FRIEND. WHAT EXACTLY IS A TYRANT?

SCIPIO: A BLIND SOUL.

CALIGULA: THAT’S A MOOT POINT. I SHOULD SAY THE REAL TYRANT IS A MAN WHO SACRIFICES A WHOLE NATION TO HIS IDEAL OR HIS AMBITION. BUT I HAVE NO IDEAL AND THERE’S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME TO COVET BY WAY OF POWER OR GLORY. IF I USE THIS POWER OF MINE IT’S TO COMPENSATE.

SCIPIO: FOR WHAT?

CALIGULA: FOR THE HATRED AND STUPIDITY OF THE GODS.

SCIPIO: HATRED DOES NOT COMPENSATE FOR HATRED. POWER IS NO SOLUTION. PERSONALLY I KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OF COUNTERING THE HOSTILITY OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

CALIGULA: YES? AND WHAT IS IT?

SCIPIO: POVERTY.

CALIGULA [BENDING OVER HIS FEET AND SCRUTINIZING HIS TOES]: I MUST TRY THAT TOO.

SCIPIO: MEANWHILE MANY MEN ROUND YOU ARE DYING.

CALIGULA: OH COME! NOT SO MANY AS ALL THAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WARS I’VE REFUSED TO EMBARK ON?

SCIPIO: NO.

CALIGULA: THREE. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY I REFUSED?

SCIPIO: BECAUSE THE GRANDEUR OF ROME MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

CALIGULA: NO. BECAUSE I RESPECT HUMAN LIFE.

SCIPIO: YOU’RE JOKING CAIUS.

CALIGULA: OR ANYHOW I RESPECT IT MORE THAN I RESPECT MILITARY TRIUMPHS. BUT IT’S A FACT THAT I DON’T RESPECT IT MORE THAN I RESPECT MY OWN LIFE. AND IF I FIND KILLING EASY IT’S BECAUSE DYING ISN’T HARD FOR ME. NO THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE SURER I FEEL THAT I’M NO TYRANT.

SCIPIO: WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF IT COSTS US QUITE AS DEAR AS IF YOU WERE ONE?

CALIGULA [WITH A HINT OF PETULANCE]: IF YOU HAD THE LEAST HEAD FOR FIGURES YOU’D KNOW THAT THE SMALLEST WAR A TYRANT—HOWEVER LEVELHEADED HE MIGHT BE—INDULGED IN WOULD COST YOU A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN ALL MY VAGARIES (SHALL WE CALL THEM?) PUT TOGETHER.

SCIPIO: POSSIBLY. BUT AT LEAST THERE’D BE SOME SENSE BEHIND A WAR; IT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE—AND TO UNDERSTAND MAKES UP FOR MUCH.

CALIGULA: THERE’S NO UNDERSTANDING FATE; THEREFORE I CHOOSE TO PLAY THE PART OF FATE. I WEAR THE FOOLISH UNINTELLIGIBLE FACE OF A PROFESSIONAL GOD. AND THAT IS WHAT THE MEN WHO WERE HERE WITH YOU HAVE LEARNED TO ADORE.

SCIPIO: THAT TOO CAIUS IS BLASPHEMY.

CALIGULA: NO SCIPIO IT’S DRAMATIC ART. THE GREAT MISTAKE YOU PEOPLE MAKE IS NOT TO TAKE THE DRAMA SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. IF YOU DID YOU’D KNOW THAT ANY MAN CAN PLAY LEAD IN THE DIVINE COMEDY AND BECOME A GOD. ALL HE NEEDS DO IS TO HARDEN HIS HEART.

SCIPIO: YOU MAY BE RIGHT CAIUS. BUT I RATHER THINK YOU’VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED TO ROUSE UP AGAINST YOU A LEGION OF HUMAN GODS RUTHLESS AS YOURSELF WHO WILL DROWN IN BLOOD YOUR GODHEAD OF A DAY.

CÆSONIA: REALLY SCIPIO!

CALIGULA [PEREMPTORILY]: NO DON’T STOP HIM CÆSONIA. YES SCIPIO YOU SPOKE TRUER THAN YOU KNEW; I’VE DONE EVERYTHING NEEDED TO THAT END. I FIND IT HARD TO PICTURE THE EVENT YOU SPEAK OF—BUT I SOMETIMES DREAM IT. AND IN ALL THOSE FACES SURGING UP OUT OF THE ANGRY DARKNESS CONVULSED WITH FEAR AND HATRED I SEE AND I REJOICE TO SEE THE ONLY GOD I’VE WORSHIPPED ON THIS EARTH; FOUL AND CRAVEN AS THE HUMAN HEART. [IRRITABLY] NOW GO. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU MORE THAN ENOUGH. [IN A DIFFERENT TONE] I REALLY MUST ATTEND TO MY TOENAILS; THEY’RE NOT NEARLY RED ENOUGH AND I’VE NO TIME TO WASTE. [ALL GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HELICON. HE HOVERS ROUND CALIGULA WHO IS BUSY EXAMINING HIS TOES.] HELICON!

HELICON: YES?

CALIGULA: GETTING ON WITH YOUR TASK?

HELICON: WHAT TASK?

CALIGULA: YOU KNOW … THE MOON.

HELICON: AH YES THE MOON.… IT’S A MATTER OF TIME AND PATIENCE. BUT I’D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU.

CALIGULA: I MIGHT HAVE PATIENCE; ONLY I HAVE NOT MUCH TIME. SO YOU MUST MAKE HASTE.

HELICON: I SAID I’D DO MY UTMOST. BUT FIRST I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. VERY SERIOUS NEWS.

CALIGULA [AS IF HE HAS NOT HEARD]: MIND YOU I’VE HAD HER ALREADY.

HELICON: WHOM?

CALIGULA: THE MOON.

HELICON: YES YES.… NOW LISTEN PLEASE. DO YOU KNOW THERE’S A PLOT BEING HATCHED AGAINST YOUR LIFE?

CALIGULA: WHAT’S MORE I HAD HER THOROUGHLY. ONLY TWO OR THREE TIMES TO BE SURE. STILL I HAD HER ALL RIGHT.

HELICON: FOR THE LAST HOUR I’VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT ONLY—

CALIGULA: IT WAS LAST SUMMER. I’D BEEN GAZING AT HER SO LONG AND STROKING HER SO OFTEN ON THE MARBLE PILLARS IN THE GARDENS THAT EVIDENTLY SHE’D COME TO UNDERSTAND.

HELICON: PLEASE STOP TRIFLING CAIUS. EVEN IF YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN IT’S MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THIS. AND IF YOU SHUT YOUR EARS IT CAN’T BE HELPED.

CALIGULA [APPLYING RED POLISH TO HIS TOENAILS]: THIS VARNISH IS NO GOOD AT ALL. BUT TO COME BACK TO THE MOON—IT WAS A CLOUDLESS AUGUST NIGHT. [HELICON LOOKS SULKILY AWAY AND KEEPS SILENCE.] SHE WAS COY TO BEGIN WITH. I’D GONE TO BED. FIRST SHE WAS BLOOD-RED LOW ON THE HORIZON. THEN SHE BEGAN RISING QUICKER AND QUICKER GROWING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER ALL THE WHILE. AND THE HIGHER SHE CLIMBED THE PALER SHE GREW TILL SHE WAS LIKE A MILKY POOL IN A DARK WOOD RUSTLING WITH STARS. SLOWLY SHYLY SHE APPROACHED THROUGH THE WARM NIGHT AIR SOFT LIGHT AS GOSSAMER NAKED IN BEAUTY. SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF MY ROOM GLIDED TO MY BED POURED HERSELF INTO IT AND FLOODED ME WITH HER SMILES AND SHEEN.… NO REALLY THIS NEW VARNISH IS A FAILURE.… SO YOU SEE HELICON I CAN SAY WITHOUT BOASTING THAT I’VE HAD HER.

HELICON: NOW WILL YOU LISTEN AND LEARN THE DANGER THAT’S THREATENING YOU?

CALIGULA [CEASING TO FIDDLE WITH HIS TOES AND GAZING AT HIM FIXEDLY]: ALL I WANT HELICON IS—THE MOON. FOR THE REST I’VE ALWAYS KNOWN WHAT WILL KILL ME. I HAVEN’T YET EXHAUSTED ALL THAT IS TO KEEP ME LIVING. THAT’S WHY I WANT THE MOON. AND YOU MUST NOT RETURN TILL YOU HAVE SECURED HER FOR ME.

HELICON: VERY WELL.… NOW I’LL DO MY DUTY AND TELL YOU WHAT I’VE LEARNED. THERE’S A PLOT AGAINST YOU. CHEREA IS THE RINGLEADER. I CAME ACROSS THIS TABLET WHICH TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. SEE I PUT IT HERE.

[HE PLACES THE TABLET ON ONE OF THE SEATS AND MOVES AWAY.]

CALIGULA: WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO HELICON?

HELICON [FROM THE THRESHOLD]: TO GET THE MOON FOR YOU.

[THERE IS A MOUSELIKE SCRATCHING AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR. CALIGULA SWINGS ROUND AND SEES THE OLD PATRICIAN.]

THE OLD PATRICIAN [TIMIDLY]: MAY I CAIUS …

CALIGULA [IMPATIENTLY]: COME IN! COME IN! [GAZES AT HIM.] SO MY PET YOU’VE RETURNED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT VENUS.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WELL … NO. IT’S NOT QUITE THAT. SSH! OH SORRY CAIUS! I ONLY WANTED TO SAY.… YOU KNOW I’M VERY VERY DEVOTED TO YOU—AND MY ONE DESIRE IS TO END MY DAYS IN PEACE.

CALIGULA: BE QUICK MAN. GET IT OUT!

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WELL IT’S … IT’S LIKE THIS. [HURRIEDLY] IT’S TERRIBLY SERIOUS THAT’S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

CALIGULA: NO IT ISN’T SERIOUS.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: BUT—I DON’T FOLLOW. WHAT ISN’T SERIOUS?

CALIGULA: BUT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MY LOVE?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [GLANCING NERVOUSLY ROUND THE ROOM]: I MEAN TO SAY.… [WRIGGLES SHUFFLES THEN BURSTS OUT WITH IT.] THERE’S A PLOT AFOOT AGAINST YOU.

CALIGULA: THERE! YOU SEE. JUST AS I SAID; IT ISN’T SERIOUS.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: BUT CAIUS THEY MEAN TO KILL YOU.

CALIGULA [APPROACHING HIM AND GRASPING HIS SHOULDERS]: DO YOU KNOW WHY I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [RAISING AN ARM AS IF TO TAKE AN OATH]: THE GODS BEAR WITNESS CAIUS THAT …

CALIGULA [GENTLY BUT FIRMLY PRESSING HIM BACK TOWARD THE DOOR]: DON’T SWEAR. I PARTICULARLY ASK YOU NOT TO SWEAR. LISTEN INSTEAD. SUPPOSE IT WERE TRUE WHAT YOU ARE TELLING ME—I’D HAVE TO ASSUME YOU WERE BETRAYING YOUR FRIENDS ISN’T THAT SO?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [FLUSTERED]: WELL CAIUS CONSIDERING THE DEEP AFFECTION I HAVE FOR YOU …

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TONE AS BEFORE]: AND I CANNOT ASSUME THAT. I’VE ALWAYS LOATHED BASENESS OF THAT SORT SO PROFOUNDLY THAT I COULD NEVER RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM HAVING A BETRAYER PUT TO DEATH. BUT I KNOW THE MAN YOU ARE MY WORTHY FRIEND. AND I’M CONVINCED YOU NEITHER WISH TO PLAY THE TRAITOR NOR TO DIE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: CERTAINLY NOT CAIUS. MOST CERTAINLY NOT.

CALIGULA: SO YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT IN REFUSING TO BELIEVE YOU. YOU WOULDN’T STOOP TO BASENESS WOULD YOU?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OH NO INDEED!

CALIGULA: NOR BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT CAIUS.

CALIGULA: THEREFORE IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE ISN’T ANY PLOT. IT WAS JUST A JOKE—BETWEEN OURSELVES RATHER A SILLY JOKE—WHAT YOU’VE JUST BEEN TELLING ME EH?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [FEEBLY]: YES YES. A JOKE MERELY A JOKE.

CALIGULA: GOOD. SO NOW WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE. NOBODY WANTS TO KILL ME.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: NOBODY. THAT’S IT. NOBODY AT ALL.

CALIGULA [DRAWING A DEEP BREATH; IN MEASURED TONES]: THEN—LEAVE ME SWEETHEART. A MAN OF HONOR IS AN ANIMAL SO RARE IN THE PRESENT-DAY WORLD THAT I COULDN’T BEAR THE SIGHT OF ONE TOO LONG. I MUST BE LEFT ALONE TO RELISH THIS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. [FOR SOME MOMENTS HE GAZES WITHOUT MOVING AT THE TABLET. HE PICKS IT UP AND READS IT. THEN AGAIN DRAWS A DEEP BREATH. THEN SUMMONS A PALACE GUARD.]

CALIGULA: BRING CHEREA TO ME. [THE MAN STARTS TO LEAVE.] WAIT! [THE MAN HALTS.] TREAT HIM POLITELY. [THE MAN GOES OUT. CALIGULA FALLS TO PACING THE ROOM. AFTER A WHILE HE APPROACHES THE MIRROR.] YOU DECIDED TO BE LOGICAL DIDN’T YOU POOR SIMPLETON? LOGIC FOR EVER! THE QUESTION NOW IS: WHERE WILL THAT TAKE YOU? [IRONICALLY] SUPPOSE THE MOON WERE BROUGHT HERE EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THAT WAS THE IDEA WASN’T IT? THEN THE IMPOSSIBLE WOULD BECOME POSSIBLE IN A FLASH THE GREAT CHANGE COME AND ALL THINGS BE TRANSFIGURED. AFTER ALL WHY SHOULDN’T HELICON BRING IT OFF? ONE NIGHT PERHAPS HE’LL CATCH HER SLEEPING IN A LAKE AND CARRY HER HERE TRAPPED IN A GLISTENING NET ALL SLIMY WITH WEEDS AND WATER LIKE A PALE BLOATED FISH DRAWN FROM THE DEPTHS. WHY NOT CALIGULA? WHY NOT INDEED? [HE CASTS A GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM.] FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ROUND ME; I WONDER WHY. [ADDRESSING THE MIRROR IN A MUFFLED VOICE] TOO MANY DEAD TOO MANY DEAD—THAT MAKES AN EMPTINESS.… NO EVEN IF THE MOON WERE MINE I COULD NOT RETRACE MY WAY. EVEN WERE THOSE DEAD MEN THRILLING AGAIN UNDER THE SUN’S CARESS THE MURDERS WOULDN’T GO BACK UNDERGROUND FOR THAT. [ANGRILY] LOGIC CALIGULA; FOLLOW WHERE LOGIC LEADS. POWER TO THE UTTERMOST; WILLFULNESS WITHOUT END. AH I’M THE ONLY MAN ON EARTH TO KNOW THE SECRET—THAT POWER CAN NEVER BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A TOTAL SELF-SURRENDER TO THE DARK IMPULSE OF ONE’S DESTINY. NO THERE’S NO RETURN. I MUST GO ON AND ON UNTIL THE CONSUMMATION.

[CHEREA ENTERS. CALIGULA IS SLUMPED IN HIS CHAIR THE CLOAK DRAWN TIGHTLY ROUND HIM.]

CHEREA: YOU SENT FOR ME CAIUS?

CALIGULA [LANGUIDLY]: YES CHEREA.

[A SHORT SILENCE.]

CHEREA: HAVE YOU ANYTHING PARTICULAR TO TELL ME?

CALIGULA: NO CHEREA.

[ANOTHER SILENCE.]

CHEREA [WITH A HINT OF PETULANCE]: ARE YOU SURE YOU REALLY NEED MY PRESENCE?

CALIGULA: ABSOLUTELY SURE CHEREA. [ANOTHER SILENCE. THEN AS IF SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF] I’M SORRY FOR SEEMING SO INHOSPITABLE. I WAS FOLLOWING UP MY THOUGHTS AND—NOW DO SIT DOWN WE’LL HAVE A FRIENDLY LITTLE CHAT. I’M IN A MOOD FOR SOME INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION. [CHEREA SITS DOWN. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE PLAY BEGAN CALIGULA GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING HIS NATURAL SELF.] DO YOU THINK CHEREA THAT IT’S POSSIBLE FOR TWO MEN OF MUCH THE SAME TEMPERAMENT AND EQUAL PRIDE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WITH COMPLETE FRANKNESS—IF ONLY ONCE IN THEIR LIVES? CAN THEY STRIP THEMSELVES NAKED SO TO SPEAK AND SHED THEIR PREJUDICES THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS THE LIES BY WHICH THEY LIVE?

CHEREA: YES CAIUS I THINK IT POSSIBLE. BUT I DON’T THINK YOU’D BE CAPABLE OF IT.

CALIGULA: YOU’RE RIGHT. I ONLY WISHED TO KNOW IF YOU AGREED WITH ME. SO LET’S WEAR OUR MASKS AND MUSTER UP OUR LIES. AND WE’LL TALK AS FENCERS FIGHT PADDED ON ALL THE VITAL PARTS. TELL ME CHEREA WHY DON’T YOU LIKE ME?

CHEREA: BECAUSE THERE’S NOTHING LIKABLE ABOUT YOU CAIUS. BECAUSE SUCH FEELINGS CAN’T BE HAD TO ORDER. AND BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU FAR TOO WELL. ONE CANNOT LIKE AN ASPECT OF ONESELF WHICH ONE ALWAYS TRIES TO KEEP CONCEALED.

CALIGULA: BUT WHY IS IT YOU HATE ME?

CHEREA: THERE CAIUS YOU’RE MISTAKEN. I DO NOT HATE YOU. I REGARD YOU AS NOXIOUS AND CRUEL VAIN AND SELFISH. BUT I CANNOT HATE YOU BECAUSE I DON’T THINK YOU ARE HAPPY. AND I CANNOT SCORN YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ARE NO COWARD.

CALIGULA: THEN WHY WISH TO KILL ME?

CHEREA: I’VE TOLD YOU WHY; BECAUSE I REGARD YOU AS NOXIOUS A CONSTANT MENACE. I LIKE AND NEED TO FEEL SECURE. SO DO MOST MEN. THEY RESENT LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS FANCY MAY AT ANY MOMENT BECOME A REALITY AND THE ABSURD TRANSFIX THEIR LIVES LIKE A DAGGER IN THE HEART. I FEEL AS THEY DO; I REFUSE TO LIVE IN A TOPSY-TURVY WORLD. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I STAND AND TO STAND SECURE.

CALIGULA: SECURITY AND LOGIC DON’T GO TOGETHER.

CHEREA: QUITE TRUE. MY PLAN OF LIFE MAY NOT BE LOGICAL BUT AT LEAST IT’S SOUND.

CALIGULA: GO ON.

CHEREA: THERE’S NO MORE TO SAY. I’LL BE NO PARTY TO YOUR LOGIC. I’VE A VERY DIFFERENT NOTION OF MY DUTIES AS A MAN. AND I KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF YOUR SUBJECTS SHARE MY VIEW. YOU OUTRAGE THEIR DEEPEST FEELINGS. IT’S ONLY NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD … DISAPPEAR.

CALIGULA: I SEE YOUR POINT AND IT’S LEGITIMATE ENOUGH. FOR MOST MEN I GRANT YOU IT’S OBVIOUS. BUT YOU I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. YOU’RE AN INTELLIGENT MAN AND GIVEN INTELLIGENCE ONE HAS A CHOICE: EITHER TO PAY ITS PRICE OR TO DISOWN IT. WHY DO YOU SHIRK THE ISSUE AND NEITHER DISOWN IT NOR CONSENT TO PAY ITS PRICE?

CHEREA: BECAUSE WHAT I WANT IS TO LIVE AND TO BE HAPPY. NEITHER TO MY MIND IS POSSIBLE IF ONE PUSHES THE ABSURD TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS. AS YOU SEE I’M QUITE AN ORDINARY SORT OF MAN. TRUE THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN TO FEEL FREE OF THEM I DESIRE THE DEATH OF THOSE I LOVE OR I HANKER AFTER WOMEN FROM WHOM THE TIES OF FAMILY OR FRIENDSHIP DEBAR ME. WERE LOGIC EVERYTHING I’D KILL OR FORNICATE ON SUCH OCCASIONS. BUT I CONSIDER THAT THESE PASSING FANCIES HAVE NO GREAT IMPORTANCE. IF EVERYONE SET TO GRATIFYING THEM THE WORLD WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN AND HAPPINESS TOO WOULD GO BY THE BOARD. AND THESE I REPEAT ARE THE THINGS THAT COUNT FOR ME.

CALIGULA: SO I TAKE IT YOU BELIEVE IN SOME HIGHER PRINCIPLE?

CHEREA: CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT SOME ACTIONS ARE—SHALL I SAY?—MORE PRAISEWORTHY THAN OTHERS.

CALIGULA: AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL ARE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING.

CHEREA: I KNOW IT CAIUS AND THAT’S WHY I DON’T HATE YOU. I UNDERSTAND AND TO A POINT AGREE WITH YOU. BUT YOU’RE PERNICIOUS AND YOU’VE GOT TO GO.

CALIGULA: TRUE ENOUGH. BUT WHY RISK YOUR LIFE BY TELLING ME THIS?

CHEREA: BECAUSE OTHERS WILL TAKE MY PLACE AND BECAUSE I DON’T LIKE LYING.

[A SHORT SILENCE.]

CALIGULA: CHEREA!

CHEREA: YES CAIUS?

CALIGULA: DO YOU THINK THAT TWO MEN OF SIMILAR TEMPERAMENT AND EQUAL PRIDE CAN IF ONLY ONCE IN THEIR LIVES OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO EACH OTHER?

CHEREA: THAT I BELIEVE IS WHAT WE’VE JUST BEEN DOING.

CALIGULA: YES CHEREA. BUT YOU THOUGHT I WAS INCAPABLE OF IT.

CHEREA: I WAS WRONG CAIUS. I ADMIT IT AND I THANK YOU. NOW I AWAIT YOUR SENTENCE.

CALIGULA: MY SENTENCE? AH I SEE. [PRODUCING THE TABLET FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK.] YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS CHEREA?

CHEREA: I KNEW YOU HAD IT.

CALIGULA [PASSIONATELY]: YOU KNEW I HAD IT! SO YOUR FRANKNESS WAS ALL A PIECE OF PLAY ACTING. THE TWO FRIENDS DID NOT OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO EACH OTHER. WELL WELL! IT’S NO GREAT MATTER. NOW WE CAN STOP PLAYING AT SINCERITY AND RESUME LIFE ON THE OLD FOOTING. BUT FIRST I’LL ASK YOU TO MAKE JUST ONE MORE EFFORT; TO BEAR WITH MY CAPRICES AND MY TACTLESSNESS A LITTLE LONGER. LISTEN WELL CHEREA. THIS TABLET IS THE ONE AND ONLY PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU.

CHEREA: CAIUS I’D RATHER GO. I’M SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THESE ANTICS. I KNOW THEM ONLY TOO WELL AND I’VE HAD ENOUGH. LET ME GO PLEASE.

CALIGULA [IN THE SAME TENSE PASSIONATE VOICE]: NO STAY. THIS TABLET IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE. IS THAT CLEAR?

CHEREA: EVIDENCE? I NEVER KNEW YOU NEEDED EVIDENCE TO SEND A MAN TO HIS DEATH.

CALIGULA: THAT’S TRUE. STILL FOR ONCE I WISH TO CONTRADICT MYSELF. NOBODY CAN OBJECT TO THAT. IT’S SO PLEASANT TO CONTRADICT ONESELF OCCASIONALLY; SO RESTFUL. AND I NEED REST CHEREA.

CHEREA: I DON’T FOLLOW … AND FRANKLY I’VE NO TASTE FOR THESE SUBTLETIES.

CALIGULA: I KNOW CHEREA I KNOW. YOU’RE NOT LIKE ME; YOU’RE AN ORDINARY MAN SOUND IN MIND AND BODY. AND NATURALLY YOU’VE NO DESIRE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY. [WITH A BURST OF LAUGHTER] YOU WANT TO LIVE AND TO BE HAPPY. THAT’S ALL!

CHEREA: I THINK CAIUS WE’D BETTER LEAVE IT AT THAT.… CAN I GO?

CALIGULA: NOT YET. A LITTLE PATIENCE IF YOU DON’T MIND—I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU LONG. YOU SEE THIS THING—THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE? I CHOOSE TO ASSUME THAT I CAN’T SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH WITHOUT IT. THAT’S MY IDEA … AND MY REPOSE. WELL! SEE WHAT BECOMES OF EVIDENCE IN AN EMPEROR’S HANDS. [HE HOLDS THE TABLET TO A TORCH. CHEREA APPROACHES. THE TORCH IS BETWEEN THEM. THE TABLET BEGINS TO MELT.] YOU SEE CONSPIRATOR! THE TABLET’S MELTING AND AS IT MELTS A LOOK OF INNOCENCE IS DAWNING ON YOUR FACE. WHAT A HANDSOME FOREHEAD YOU HAVE CHEREA! AND HOW RARE HOW BEAUTIFUL A SIGHT IS AN INNOCENT MAN! ADMIRE MY POWER. EVEN THE GODS CANNOT RESTORE INNOCENCE WITHOUT FIRST PUNISHING THE CULPRIT. BUT YOUR EMPEROR NEEDS ONLY A TORCH FLAME TO ABSOLVE YOU AND GIVE YOU A NEW LEASE OF HOPE. SO CARRY ON CHEREA; FOLLOW OUT THE NOBLE PRECEPTS WE’VE BEEN HEARING WHEREVER THEY MAY TAKE YOU. MEANWHILE YOUR EMPEROR AWAITS HIS REPOSE. IT’S HIS WAY OF LIVING AND BEING HAPPY.

   [CHEREA STARES DUMFOUNDED AT CALIGULA. HE MAKES A VAGUE GESTURE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND OPENS HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK—AND WALKS ABRUPTLY AWAY. SMILING HOLDING THE TABLET TO THE FLAME CALIGULA FOLLOWS THE RECEDING FIGURE WITH HIS GAZE.]

CURTAIN

ACT IV
A ROOM IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE.

THE STAGE IS IN SEMIDARKNESS. CHEREA AND SCIPIO ENTER. CHEREA CROSSES TO THE RIGHT THEN COMES BACK LEFT TO SCIPIO.

SCIPIO [SULKILY]: WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME?

CHEREA: THERE’S NO TIME TO LOSE. AND WE MUST KNOW OUR MINDS WE MUST BE RESOLUTE.

SCIPIO: WHO SAYS I’M NOT RESOLUTE?

CHEREA: YOU DIDN’T ATTEND OUR MEETING YESTERDAY.

SCIPIO [LOOKING AWAY]: THAT’S SO CHEREA.

CHEREA: SCIPIO I AM OLDER THAN YOU AND I’M NOT IN THE HABIT OF ASKING OTHERS’ HELP. BUT I WON’T DENY IT I NEED YOU NOW. THIS MURDER NEEDS HONORABLE MEN TO SPONSOR IT. AMONG ALL THESE WOUNDED VANITIES AND SORDID FEARS OUR MOTIVES ONLY YOURS AND MINE ARE DISINTERESTED. OF COURSE I KNOW THAT IF YOU LEAVE US WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SILENCE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT. WHAT I WANT IS—FOR YOU TO STAY WITH US.

SCIPIO: I UNDERSTAND. BUT I CAN’T OH NO I CANNOT DO AS YOU WISH.

CHEREA: SO YOU ARE WITH HIM?

SCIPIO: NO. BUT I CANNOT BE AGAINST HIM. [PAUSES; THEN IN A MUFFLED VOICE] EVEN IF I KILLED HIM MY HEART WOULD STILL BE WITH HIM.

CHEREA: AND YET—HE KILLED YOUR FATHER!

SCIPIO: YES—AND THAT’S HOW IT ALL BEGAN. BUT THAT TOO IS HOW IT ENDS.

CHEREA: HE DENIES WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. HE TRAMPLES ON ALL THAT YOU HOLD SACRED.

SCIPIO: I KNOW CHEREA. AND YET SOMETHING INSIDE ME IS AKIN TO HIM. THE SAME FIRE BURNS IN BOTH OUR HEARTS.

CHEREA: THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A MAN MUST MAKE HIS CHOICE. AS FOR ME I HAVE SILENCED IN MY HEART ALL THAT MIGHT BE AKIN TO HIM.

SCIPIO: BUT—I—I CANNOT MAKE A CHOICE. I HAVE MY OWN SORROW BUT I SUFFER WITH HIM TOO; I SHARE HIS PAIN. I UNDERSTAND ALL—THAT IS MY TROUBLE.

CHEREA: SO THAT’S IT. YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE HIS SIDE.

SCIPIO [PASSIONATELY]: NO CHEREA. I BEG YOU DON’T THINK THAT. I CAN NEVER NEVER AGAIN TAKE ANYBODY’S SIDE.

CHEREA [AFFECTIONATELY; APPROACHING SCIPIO]: DO YOU KNOW I HATE HIM EVEN MORE FOR HAVING MADE OF YOU—WHAT HE HAS MADE.

SCIPIO: YES HE HAS TAUGHT ME TO EXPECT EVERYTHING OF LIFE.

CHEREA: NO HE HAS TAUGHT YOU DESPAIR. AND TO HAVE INSTILLED DESPAIR INTO A YOUNG HEART IS FOULER THAN THE FOULEST OF THE CRIMES HE HAS COMMITTED UP TO NOW. I ASSURE YOU THAT ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN KILLING HIM OUT OF HAND.

[HE GOES TOWARD THE DOOR. HELICON ENTERS.]

HELICON: I’VE BEEN HUNTING FOR YOU HIGH AND LOW CHEREA. CALIGULA’S GIVING A LITTLE PARTY HERE FOR HIS PERSONAL FRIENDS ONLY. NATURALLY HE EXPECTS YOU TO ATTEND IT. [TO SCIPIO] YOU MY BOY AREN’T WANTED. OFF YOU GO!

SCIPIO [LOOKING BACK AT CHEREA AS HE GOES OUT]: CHEREA.

CHEREA [GENTLY]: YES SCIPIO?

SCIPIO: TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

CHEREA [IN THE SAME GENTLE TONE]: NO SCIPIO.

[SCIPIO AND HELICON GO OUT. A CLASH OF ARMS IN THE WINGS. TWO SOLDIERS ENTER AT RIGHT ESCORTING THE OLD PATRICIAN AND THE FIRST PATRICIAN WHO SHOW SIGNS OF ALARM.]

FIRST PATRICIAN [TO ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IN A TONE WHICH HE VAINLY TRIES TO STEADY]: BUT … BUT WHAT CAN HE WANT WITH US AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT?

SOLDIER: SIT THERE. [POINTS TO THE CHAIRS ON THE RIGHT.]

FIRST PATRICIAN: IF IT’S ONLY TO HAVE US KILLED—LIKE SO MANY OTHERS—WHY ALL THESE PRELIMINARIES?

SOLDIER: SIT DOWN YOU OLD MULE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: BETTER DO AS HE SAYS. IT’S CLEAR HE DOESN’T KNOW ANYTHING.

SOLDIER: YES DARLING QUITE CLEAR. [GOES OUT.]

FIRST PATRICIAN: WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED SOONER; I ALWAYS SAID SO. NOW WE’RE IN FOR THE TORTURE CHAMBER.

[THE SOLDIER COMES BACK WITH CHEREA THEN GOES OUT.]

CHEREA [SEATING HIMSELF. HE SHOWS NO SIGN OF APPREHENSION]: ANY IDEA WHAT’S HAPPENING?

FIRST PATRICIAN AND THE OLD PATRICIAN [SPEAKING TOGETHER]: HE’S FOUND OUT ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY.

CHEREA: YES? AND THEN?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [SHUDDERING]: THE TORTURE CHAMBER FOR US ALL.

CHEREA [STILL UNPERTURBED]: I REMEMBER THAT CALIGULA ONCE GAVE EIGHTY-ONE THOUSAND SESTERCES TO A SLAVE WHO THOUGH HE WAS TORTURED NEARLY TO DEATH WOULDN’T CONFESS TO A THEFT HE HAD COMMITTED.

FIRST PATRICIAN: A LOT OF CONSOLATION THAT IS—FOR US!

CHEREA: ANYHOW IT SHOWS THAT HE APPRECIATES COURAGE. YOU OUGHT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. [TO THE OLD PATRICIAN] WOULD YOU VERY MUCH MIND NOT CHATTERING WITH YOUR TEETH? IT’S A NOISE I PARTICULARLY DISLIKE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: I’M SORRY BUT—

FIRST PATRICIAN: ENOUGH TRIFLING! OUR LIVES ARE AT STAKE.

CHEREA [COOLLY]: DO YOU KNOW CALIGULA’S FAVORITE REMARK?

THE OLD PATRICIAN [ON THE VERGE OF TEARS]: YES. HE SAYS TO THE EXECUTIONER: “KILL HIM SLOWLY SO THAT HE FEELS WHAT DYING’S LIKE!”

CHEREA: NO THERE’S A BETTER ONE. AFTER AN EXECUTION HE YAWNS AND SAYS QUITE SERIOUSLY: “WHAT I ADMIRE MOST IS MY IMPERTURBABILITY.”

FIRST PATRICIAN: DO YOU HEAR …?

[A CLANKING OF WEAPONS IS HEARD OFF STAGE.]

CHEREA: THAT REMARK BETRAYS A WEAKNESS IN HIS MAKE-UP.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WOULD YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO STOP PHILOSOPHIZING? IT’S SOMETHING I PARTICULARLY DISLIKE.

[A SLAVE ENTERS AND DEPOSITS A SHEAF OF KNIVES ON A SEAT.]

CHEREA [WHO HAS NOT NOTICED HIM]: STILL THERE’S NO DENYING IT’S REMARKABLE THE EFFECT THIS MAN HAS ON ALL WITH WHOM HE COMES IN CONTACT. HE FORCES ONE TO THINK. THERE’S NOTHING LIKE INSECURITY FOR STIMULATING THE BRAIN. THAT OF COURSE IS WHY HE’S SO MUCH HATED.

THE OLD PATRICIAN [POINTING A TREMBLING FINGER]: LOOK!

CHEREA [NOTICING THE KNIVES IN A SLIGHTLY ALTERED TONE]: PERHAPS YOU WERE RIGHT.

FIRST PATRICIAN: YES WAITING WAS A MISTAKE. WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED AT ONCE.

CHEREA: I AGREE. WISDOM’S COME TOO LATE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: BUT IT’S … IT’S CRAZY. I DON’T WANT TO DIE.

[HE RISES AND BEGINS TO EDGE AWAY. TWO SOLDIERS APPEAR AND AFTER SLAPPING HIS FACE FORCE HIM BACK ONTO HIS SEAT. THE FIRST PATRICIAN SQUIRMS IN HIS CHAIR. CHEREA UTTERS SOME INAUDIBLE WORDS. SUDDENLY A QUEER MUSIC BEGINS BEHIND THE CURTAIN AT THE BACK OF THE STAGE; A THRUMMING AND TINKLING OF ZITHERS AND CYMBALS. THE PATRICIANS GAZE AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE. OUTLINED ON THE ILLUMINATED CURTAIN IN SHADOW PLAY CALIGULA APPEARS MAKES SOME GROTESQUE DANCE MOVEMENTS AND RETREATS FROM VIEW. HE IS WEARING BALLET DANCER’S SKIRTS AND HIS HEAD IS GARLANDED WITH FLOWERS. A MOMENT LATER A SOLDIER ANNOUNCES GRAVELY: “GENTLEMEN THE PERFORMANCE IS OVER.” MEANWHILE CÆSONIA HAS ENTERED SOUNDLESSLY BEHIND THE WATCHING PATRICIANS. SHE SPEAKS IN AN ORDINARY VOICE BUT NONE THE LESS THEY GIVE A START ON HEARING IT.]

CÆSONIA: CALIGULA HAS INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT WHEREAS IN THE PAST HE ALWAYS SUMMONED YOU FOR AFFAIRS OF STATE TODAY HE INVITED YOU TO SHARE WITH HIM AN ARTISTIC EMOTION. [A SHORT PAUSE. THEN SHE CONTINUES IN THE SAME TONE] HE ADDED I MAY SAY THAT ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SHARED IN IT WILL BE BEHEADED. [THEY KEEP SILENT.] I APOLOGIZE FOR INSISTING BUT I MUST ASK YOU IF YOU FOUND THAT DANCE BEAUTIFUL.

FIRST PATRICIAN [AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION]: YES CÆSONIA. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

THE OLD PATRICIAN [EFFUSIVELY]: LOVELY! LOVELY!

CÆSONIA: AND YOU CHEREA?

CHEREA [ICILY]: IT WAS … VERY HIGH ART.

CÆSONIA: GOOD. NOW I CAN DESCRIBE YOUR ARTISTIC EMOTIONS TO CALIGULA.

[CÆSONIA GOES OUT.]

CHEREA: AND NOW WE MUST ACT QUICKLY. YOU TWO STAY HERE. BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OUT THERE’LL BE A HUNDRED OF US.

[HE GOES OUT.]

THE OLD PATRICIAN: NO NO. YOU STAY. LET ME GO INSTEAD. [SNIFFS THE AIR.] IT SMELLS OF DEATH HERE.

FIRST PATRICIAN: AND OF LIES. [SADLY] I SAID THAT DANCE WAS BEAUTIFUL!

THE OLD PATRICIAN [CONCILIATINGLY]: AND SO IT WAS IN A WAY. MOST ORIGINAL.

[SOME PATRICIANS AND KNIGHTS ENTER HURRIEDLY.]

SECOND PATRICIAN: WHAT’S AFOOT? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING? THE EMPEROR’S SUMMONED US HERE.

THE OLD PATRICIAN [ABSENT-MINDEDLY]: FOR THE DANCE MAYBE.

SECOND PATRICIAN: WHAT DANCE?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WELL I MEAN … ER … THE ARTISTIC EMOTION.

THIRD PATRICIAN: I’VE BEEN TOLD CALIGULA’S VERY ILL.

FIRST PATRICIAN: HE’S A SICK MAN YES.…

THIRD PATRICIAN: WHAT’S HE SUFFERING FROM? [IN A JOYFUL TONE] BY GOD IS HE GOING TO DIE?

FIRST PATRICIAN: I DOUBT IT. HIS DISEASE IS FATAL—TO OTHERS ONLY.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: THAT’S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT.

SECOND PATRICIAN: QUITE SO. BUT HASN’T HE SOME OTHER DISEASE LESS SERIOUS AND MORE TO OUR ADVANTAGE?

FIRST PATRICIAN: NO. THAT MALADY OF HIS EXCLUDES ALL OTHERS.

[HE GOES OUT. CÆSONIA ENTERS. A SHORT SILENCE.]

CÆSONIA [IN A CASUAL TONE]: IF YOU WANT TO KNOW CALIGULA HAS STOMACH TROUBLE. JUST NOW HE VOMITED BLOOD.

[THE PATRICIANS CROWD ROUND HER.]

SECOND PATRICIAN: O MIGHTY GODS I VOW IF HE RECOVERS TO PAY THE TREASURY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SESTERCES AS A TOKEN OF MY JOY.

THIRD PATRICIAN [WITH EXAGGERATED EAGERNESS]: O JUPITER TAKE MY LIFE IN PLACE OF HIS!

[CALIGULA HAS ENTERED AND IS LISTENING.]

CALIGULA [GOING UP TO THE SECOND PATRICIAN]: I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER LUCIUS. AND I THANK YOU. MY TREASURER WILL CALL ON YOU TOMORROW. [GOES TO THE THIRD PATRICIAN AND EMBRACES HIM.] YOU CAN’T IMAGINE HOW TOUCHED I AM. [A SHORT SILENCE. THEN TENDERLY] SO YOU LOVE ME CASSIUS AS MUCH AS THAT?

THIRD PATRICIAN [EMOTIONALLY]: OH CÆSAR THERE’S NOTHING NOTHING I WOULDN’T SACRIFICE FOR YOUR SAKE.

CALIGULA [EMBRACING HIM AGAIN]: AH CASSIUS THIS IS REALLY TOO MUCH; I DON’T DESERVE ALL THIS LOVE. [CASSIUS MAKES A PROTESTING GESTURE.] NO NO REALLY I DON’T! I’M NOT WORTHY OF IT. [HE BECKONS TO TWO SOLDIERS.] TAKE HIM AWAY. [GENTLY TO CASSIUS] GO DEAR FRIEND AND REMEMBER THAT CALIGULA HAS LOST HIS HEART TO YOU.

THIRD PATRICIAN [VAGUELY UNEASY]: BUT—WHERE ARE THEY TAKING ME?

CALIGULA: WHY TO YOUR DEATH OF COURSE. YOUR GENEROUS OFFER WAS ACCEPTED AND I FEEL BETTER ALREADY. EVEN THAT NASTY TASTE OF BLOOD IN MY MOUTH HAS GONE. YOU’VE CURED ME CASSIUS. IT’S BEEN MIRACULOUS AND HOW PROUD YOU MUST FEEL OF HAVING WORKED THE MIRACLE BY LAYING YOUR LIFE DOWN FOR YOUR FRIEND—ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT FRIEND’S NONE OTHER THAN CALIGULA! SO NOW YOU SEE ME QUITE MYSELF AGAIN AND READY FOR A FESTIVE NIGHT.

THIRD PATRICIAN [SHRIEKING AS HE IS DRAGGED AWAY]: NO! NO! I DON’T WANT TO DIE. YOU CAN’T BE SERIOUS!

CALIGULA [IN A THOUGHTFUL VOICE BETWEEN THE SHRIEKS]: SOON THE SEA ROADS WILL BE GOLDEN WITH MIMOSAS. THE WOMEN WILL WEAR THEIR LIGHTEST DRESSES. AND THE SKY! AH CASSIUS WHAT A BLAZE OF CLEAN SWIFT SUNSHINE! THE SMILES OF LIFE. [CASSIUS IS NEAR THE DOOR. CALIGULA GIVES HIM A GENTLE PUSH. SUDDENLY HIS TONE GROWS SERIOUS] LIFE MY FRIEND IS SOMETHING TO BE CHERISHED. HAD YOU CHERISHED IT ENOUGH YOU WOULDN’T HAVE GAMBLED IT AWAY SO RASHLY. [CASSIUS IS LED OFF. CALIGULA RETURNS TO THE TABLE.] THE LOSER MUST PAY. THERE’S NO ALTERNATIVE. [A SHORT SILENCE.] COME CÆSONIA. [HE TURNS TO THE OTHERS] BY THE WAY AN IDEA HAS JUST WAYLAID ME AND IT’S SUCH AN APT ONE THAT I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU. UNTIL NOW MY REIGN HAS BEEN TOO HAPPY. THERE’S BEEN NO WORLD-WIDE PLAGUE NO RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION NOT EVEN A REBELLION—NOTHING IN FACT TO MAKE US MEMORABLE. AND THAT I’D HAVE YOU KNOW IS WHY I TRY TO REMEDY THE STINGINESS OF FATE. I MEAN—I DON’T KNOW IF YOU’VE FOLLOWED ME—THAT WELL [HE GIVES A LITTLE LAUGH] IT’S I WHO REPLACE THE EPIDEMICS THAT WE’VE MISSED. [IN A DIFFERENT TONE] THAT’S ENOUGH. I SEE CHEREA’S COMING. YOUR TURN CÆSONIA. [CALIGULA GOES OUT. CHEREA AND THE FIRST PATRICIAN ENTER. CÆSONIA HURRIES TOWARD CHEREA.]

CÆSONIA: CALIGULA IS DEAD.

[SHE TURNS HER HEAD AS IF TO HIDE HER TEARS; HER EYES ARE FIXED ON THE OTHERS WHO KEEP SILENCE. EVERYONE LOOKS HORRIFIED BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.]

FIRST PATRICIAN: YOU … YOU’RE SURE THIS DREADFUL THING HAS HAPPENED? IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE. ONLY A SHORT WHILE AGO HE WAS DANCING.

CÆSONIA: QUITE SO—AND THE EFFORT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM. [CHEREA MOVES HASTILY FROM ONE MAN TO THE OTHER. NO ONE SPEAKS.] YOU’VE NOTHING TO SAY CHEREA?

CHEREA [IN A LOW VOICE]: IT’S A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR US ALL CÆSONIA.

[CALIGULA BURSTS IN VIOLENTLY AND GOES UP TO CHEREA.]

CALIGULA: WELL PLAYED CHEREA. [HE SPINS ROUND AND STARES AT THE OTHERS. PETULANTLY] TOO BAD! IT DIDN’T COME OFF. [TO CÆSONIA] DON’T FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU.

[CALIGULA GOES OUT. CÆSONIA STARES AFTER HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING.]

THE OLD PATRICIAN [HOPING AGAINST HOPE]: IS HE ILL CÆSONIA?

CÆSONIA [WITH A HOSTILE LOOK]: NO MY PET. BUT WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW IS THAT THE MAN NEVER HAS MORE THAN TWO HOURS’ SLEEP AND SPENDS THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT ROAMING ABOUT THE CORRIDORS IN HIS PALACE. ANOTHER THING YOU DON’T KNOW—AND YOU’VE NEVER GIVEN A THOUGHT TO—IS WHAT MAY PASS IN THIS MAN’S MIND IN THOSE DEADLY HOURS BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE. IS HE ILL? NO NOT ILL—UNLESS YOU INVENT A NAME AND MEDICINE FOR THE BLACK ULCERS THAT FESTER IN HIS SOUL.

CHEREA [SEEMINGLY AFFECTED BY HER WORDS]: YOU’RE RIGHT CÆSONIA. WE ALL KNOW THAT CAIUS …

CÆSONIA [BREAKING IN EMOTIONALLY]: YES YOU KNOW IT—IN YOUR FASHION. BUT LIKE ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NONE YOU CAN’T ABIDE ANYONE WHO HAS TOO MUCH SOUL. HEALTHY PEOPLE LOATHE INVALIDS. HAPPY PEOPLE HATE THE SAD. TOO MUCH SOUL! THAT’S WHAT BITES YOU ISN’T IT? YOU PREFER TO LABEL IT A DISEASE; THAT WAY ALL THE DOLTS ARE JUSTIFIED AND PLEASED. [IN A CHANGED TONE] TELL ME CHEREA. HAS LOVE EVER MEANT ANYTHING TO YOU?

CHEREA [HIMSELF AGAIN]: I’M AFRAID WE’RE TOO OLD NOW CÆSONIA TO LEARN THE ART OF LOVE-MAKING. AND ANYHOW IT’S HIGHLY DOUBTFUL IF CALIGULA WILL GIVE US TIME TO DO SO.

CÆSONIA [WHO HAS RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE]: TRUE ENOUGH. [SHE SITS DOWN.] OH I WAS FORGETTING.… CALIGULA ASKED ME TO IMPART SOME NEWS TO YOU. YOU KNOW PERHAPS THAT IT’S A RED-LETTER DAY TODAY CONSECRATED TO ART.

THE OLD PATRICIAN: ACCORDING TO THE CALENDAR?

CÆSONIA: NO ACCORDING TO CALIGULA. HE’S CONVOKED SOME POETS. HE WILL ASK THEM TO IMPROVISE A POEM ON A SET THEME. AND HE PARTICULARLY WANTS THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE POETS TO TAKE PART IN THE COMPETITION. HE SPECIALLY MENTIONED YOUNG SCIPIO AND METELLUS.

METELLUS: BUT WE’RE NOT READY.

CÆSONIA [IN A LEVEL TONE AS IF SHE HAS NOT HEARD HIM]: NEEDLESS TO SAY THERE ARE PRIZES. THERE WILL BE PENALTIES TOO. [LOOKS OF CONSTERNATION.] BETWEEN OURSELVES THE PENALTIES WON’T BE SO VERY TERRIBLE.

[CALIGULA ENTERS LOOKING GLOOMIER THAN EVER.]

CALIGULA: ALL READY?

CÆSONIA: YES. [TO A SOLDIER] BRING IN THE POETS.

   [ENTER TWO BY TWO A DOZEN POETS KEEPING STEP; THEY LINE UP ON THE RIGHT OF THE STAGE.]

CALIGULA: AND THE OTHERS?

CÆSONIA: METELLUS! SCIPIO!

[THEY CROSS THE STAGE AND TAKE THEIR STAND BESIDE THE POETS. CALIGULA SEATS HIMSELF BACKSTAGE ON THE LEFT WITH CÆSONIA AND THE PATRICIANS. A SHORT SILENCE.]

CALIGULA: SUBJECT: DEATH. TIME LIMIT: ONE MINUTE.

[THE POETS SCRIBBLE FEVERISHLY ON THEIR TABLETS.]

THE OLD PATRICIAN: WHO WILL COMPOSE THE JURY?

CALIGULA: I. ISN’T THAT ENOUGH?

THE OLD PATRICIAN: OH YES INDEED. QUITE ENOUGH.

CHEREA: WON’T YOU TAKE PART IN THE COMPETITION CAIUS?

CALIGULA: UNNECESSARY. I MADE MY POEM ON THAT THEME LONG AGO.

THE OLD PATRICIAN [EAGERLY]: WHERE CAN ONE GET A COPY OF IT?

CALIGULA: NO NEED TO GET A COPY. I RECITE IT EVERY DAY AFTER MY FASHION. [CÆSONIA EYES HIM NERVOUSLY. CALIGULA ROUNDS ON HER ALMOST SAVAGELY] IS THERE ANYTHING IN MY APPEARANCE THAT DISPLEASES YOU?

CÆSONIA [GENTLY]: I’M SORRY.…

CALIGULA: NO MEEKNESS PLEASE. FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE NO MEEKNESS. YOU’RE EXASPERATING ENOUGH AS IT IS BUT IF YOU START BEING HUMBLE … [CÆSONIA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY. CALIGULA TURNS TO CHEREA.] I CONTINUE. IT’S THE ONLY POEM I HAVE MADE. AND IT’S PROOF THAT I’M THE ONLY TRUE ARTIST ROME HAS KNOWN—THE ONLY ONE BELIEVE ME—TO MATCH HIS INSPIRATION WITH HIS DEEDS.

CHEREA: THAT’S ONLY A MATTER OF HAVING THE POWER.

CALIGULA: QUITE TRUE. OTHER ARTISTS CREATE TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR LACK OF POWER. I DON’T NEED TO MAKE A WORK OF ART; I LIVE IT. [ROUGHLY] WELL POETS ARE YOU READY?

METELLUS: I THINK SO.

THE OTHERS: YES.

CALIGULA: GOOD. NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY. YOU ARE TO FALL OUT OF LINE AND COME FORWARD ONE BY ONE. I’LL WHISTLE. NUMBER ONE WILL START READING HIS POEM. WHEN I WHISTLE HE MUST STOP AND THE NEXT BEGIN. AND SO ON. THE WINNER NATURALLY WILL BE THE ONE WHOSE POEM HASN’T BEEN CUT SHORT BY THE WHISTLE. GET READY. [TURNING TO CHEREA HE WHISPERS] YOU SEE ORGANIZATION’S NEEDED FOR EVERYTHING EVEN FOR ART.

[BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.]

FIRST POET: DEATH WHEN BEYOND THY DARKLING SHORE …

[A BLAST OF THE WHISTLE. THE POET STEPS BRISKLY TO THE LEFT. THE OTHERS WILL FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE THESE MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE MADE WITH MECHANICAL PRECISION.]

SECOND POET: IN THEIR DIM CAVE THE FATAL SISTERS THREE …

[WHISTLE.]

THIRD POET: COME TO ME DEATH BELOVED …

[A SHRILL BLAST OF THE WHISTLE. THE FOURTH POET STEPS FORWARD AND STRIKES A DRAMATIC POSTURE. THE WHISTLE GOES BEFORE HE HAS OPENED HIS MOUTH.]

FIFTH POET: WHEN I WAS IN MY HAPPY INFANCY …

CALIGULA [YELLING]: STOP THAT! WHAT EARTHLY CONNECTION HAS A BLOCKHEAD’S HAPPY INFANCY WITH THE THEME I SET? THE CONNECTION! TELL ME THE CONNECTION!

FIFTH POET: BUT CAIUS I’VE ONLY JUST BEGUN AND … [SHRILL BLAST.]

SIXTH POET [IN A HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]: RUTHLESS HE GOES HIS HIDDEN WAYS …

[WHISTLE]

SEVENTH POET [MYSTERIOUSLY]: OH LONG ABSTRUSE ORISON …

[WHISTLE BROKEN OFF AS SCIPIO COMES FORWARD WITHOUT A TABLET.]

CALIGULA: YOU HAVEN’T A TABLET?

SCIPIO: I DO NOT NEED ONE.

CALIGULA: WELL LET’S HEAR YOU. [HE CHEWS AT HIS WHISTLE.]

SCIPIO [STANDING VERY NEAR CALIGULA HE RECITES LISTLESSLY WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM]:
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT PURIFIES THE HEART
SKIES RIPPLING WITH LIGHT
O WILD SWEET FESTAL JOYS FRENZY WITHOUT HOPE!

CALIGULA [GENTLY]: STOP PLEASE. THE OTHERS NEEDN’T COMPETE. [TO SCIPIO] YOU’RE VERY YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND SO WELL THE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM DEATH.

SCIPIO [GAZING STRAIGHT AT CALIGULA]: I WAS VERY YOUNG TO LOSE MY FATHER.

CALIGULA [TURNING HASTILY]: FALL IN THE REST OF YOU. NO REALLY A SHAM POET IS TOO DREADFUL AN INFLICTION. UNTIL NOW I’D THOUGHT OF ENROLLING YOU AS MY ALLIES; I SOMETIMES PICTURED A GALLANT BAND OF POETS DEFENDING ME IN THE LAST DITCH. ANOTHER ILLUSION GONE! I SHALL HAVE TO RELEGATE YOU TO MY ENEMIES. SO NOW THE POETS ARE AGAINST ME—AND THAT LOOKS MUCH LIKE THE END OF ALL. MARCH OUT IN GOOD ORDER. AS YOU GO PAST YOU ARE TO LICK YOUR TABLETS SO AS TO EFFACE THE ATROCITIES YOU SCRAWLED ON THEM. ATTENTION! FORWARD! [HE BLOWS HIS WHISTLE IN SHORT RHYTHMIC JERKS. KEEPING STEP THE POETS FILE OUT BY THE RIGHT TONGUING THEIR IMMORTAL TABLETS. CALIGULA ADDS IN A LOWER TONE] NOW LEAVE ME EVERYONE.
[IN THE DOORWAY AS THEY ARE GOING OUT CHEREA TOUCHES THE FIRST PATRICIAN’S SHOULDER AND SPEAKS IN HIS EAR.]

CHEREA: NOW’S OUR OPPORTUNITY.

   [SCIPIO WHO HAS OVERHEARD HALTS ON THE THRESHOLD AND WALKS BACK TO CALIGULA.]

CALIGULA [ACIDLY]: CAN’T YOU LEAVE ME IN PEACE—AS YOUR FATHER’S DOING?

SCIPIO: NO CAIUS ALL THAT SERVES NO PURPOSE NOW. FOR NOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOUR CHOICE.

CALIGULA: WON’T YOU LEAVE ME IN PEACE!

SCIPIO: YES YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH; I AM GOING TO LEAVE YOU FOR I THINK I’VE COME TO UNDERSTAND YOU. THERE’S NO WAY OUT LEFT TO US NEITHER TO YOU NOR TO ME—WHO AM LIKE YOU IN SO MANY WAYS. I SHALL GO AWAY FAR AWAY AND TRY TO DISCOVER THE MEANING OF IT ALL. [HE GAZES AT CALIGULA FOR SOME MOMENTS. THEN WITH A RUSH OF EMOTION] GOOD-BY DEAR CAIUS. WHEN ALL IS ENDED REMEMBER THAT I LOVED YOU. [HE GOES OUT. CALIGULA MAKES A VAGUE GESTURE. THEN ALMOST SAVAGELY HE PULLS HIMSELF TOGETHER AND TAKES SOME STEPS TOWARD CÆSONIA.]

CÆSONIA: WHAT DID HE SAY?

CALIGULA: NOTHING YOU’D UNDERSTAND.

CÆSONIA: WHAT ARE THINKING ABOUT?

CALIGULA: ABOUT HIM. AND ABOUT YOU TOO. BUT IT AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING.

CÆSONIA: WHAT IS THE MATTER?

CALIGULA [STARING AT HER]: SCIPIO HAS GONE. I AM THROUGH WITH HIS FRIENDSHIP. BUT YOU I WONDER WHY YOU ARE STILL HERE.…

CÆSONIA: WHY BECAUSE YOU’RE FOND OF ME.

CALIGULA: NO. BUT I THINK I’D UNDERSTAND—IF I HAD YOU KILLED.

CÆSONIA: YES THAT WOULD BE A SOLUTION. DO SO THEN.… BUT WHY OH WHY CAN’T YOU RELAX IF ONLY FOR A MOMENT AND LIVE FREELY WITHOUT CONSTRAINT?

CALIGULA: I HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS; IN FACT I’VE MADE A PRACTICE OF IT.

CÆSONIA: I DON’T MEAN THAT SORT OF FREEDOM. I MEAN—OH DON’T YOU REALIZE WHAT IT CAN BE TO LIVE AND LOVE QUITE SIMPLY NATURALLY IN … IN PURITY OF HEART?

CALIGULA: THIS PURITY OF HEART YOU TALK OF—EVERY MAN ACQUIRES IT IN HIS OWN WAY. MINE HAS BEEN TO FOLLOW THE ESSENTIAL TO THE END.… STILL ALL THAT NEEDN’T PREVENT ME FROM PUTTING YOU TO DEATH. [LAUGHS.] IT WOULD ROUND OFF MY CAREER SO WELL THE PERFECT CLIMAX. [HE RISES AND SWINGS THE MIRROR ROUND TOWARD HIMSELF. THEN HE WALKS IN A CIRCLE LETTING HIS ARMS HANG LIMP ALMOST WITHOUT GESTURES; THERE IS SOMETHING FERAL IN HIS GAIT AS HE CONTINUES SPEAKING.] HOW STRANGE! WHEN I DON’T KILL I FEEL ALONE. THE LIVING DON’T SUFFICE TO PEOPLE MY WORLD AND DISPEL MY BOREDOM. I HAVE AN IMPRESSION OF AN ENORMOUS VOID WHEN YOU AND THE OTHERS ARE HERE AND MY EYES SEE NOTHING BUT EMPTY AIR. NO I’M AT EASE ONLY IN THE COMPANY OF MY DEAD. [HE TAKES HIS STAND FACING THE AUDIENCE LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD. HE HAS FORGOTTEN CÆSONIA’S PRESENCE.] ONLY THE DEAD ARE REAL. THEY ARE OF MY KIND. I SEE THEM WAITING FOR ME STRAINING TOWARD ME. AND I HAVE LONG TALKS WITH THIS MAN OR THAT WHO SCREAMED TO ME FOR MERCY AND WHOSE TONGUE I HAD CUT OUT.

CÆSONIA: COME. LIE DOWN BESIDE ME. PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY KNEES. [CALIGULA DOES SO.] THAT’S BETTER ISN’T IT? NOW REST. HOW QUIET IT IS HERE!

CALIGULA: QUIET? YOU EXAGGERATE MY DEAR. LISTEN! [DISTANT METALLIC TINKLINGS AS OF SWORDS OR ARMOR.] DO YOU HEAR THOSE THOUSANDS OF SMALL SOUNDS ALL AROUND US HATRED STALKING ITS PREY? [MURMURING VOICES FOOTSTEPS.]

CÆSONIA: NOBODY WOULD DARE.…

CALIGULA: YES STUPIDITY.

CÆSONIA: STUPIDITY DOESN’T KILL. IT MAKES MEN SLOW TO ACT.

CALIGULA: IT CAN BE MURDEROUS CÆSONIA. A FOOL STOPS AT NOTHING WHEN HE THINKS HIS DIGNITY OFFENDED. NO IT’S NOT THE MEN WHOSE SONS OR FATHERS I HAVE KILLED WHO’LL MURDER ME. THEY ANYHOW HAVE UNDERSTOOD. THEY’RE WITH ME THEY HAVE THE SAME TASTE IN THEIR MOUTHS. BUT THE OTHERS—THOSE I MADE A LAUGHINGSTOCK OF—I’VE NO DEFENSE AGAINST THEIR WOUNDED VANITY.

CÆSONIA [PASSIONATELY]: WE WILL DEFEND YOU. THERE ARE MANY OF US LEFT WHO LOVE YOU.

CALIGULA: FEWER EVERY DAY. IT’S NOT SURPRISING. I’VE DONE ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO THAT END. AND THEN—LET’S BE FAIR—IT’S NOT ONLY STUPIDITY THAT’S AGAINST ME. THERE’S THE COURAGE AND THE SIMPLE FAITH OF MEN WHO ASK TO BE HAPPY.

CÆSONIA [IN THE SAME TONE]: NO THEY WILL NOT KILL YOU. OR IF THEY TRIED FIRE WOULD COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND BLAST THEM BEFORE THEY LAID A HAND ON YOU.

CALIGULA: FROM HEAVEN! THERE IS NO HEAVEN MY POOR DEAR WOMAN! [HE SITS DOWN.] BUT WHY THIS SUDDEN ACCESS OF DEVOTION? IT WASN’T PROVIDED FOR IN OUR AGREEMENT IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY.

CÆSONIA [WHO HAS RISEN FROM THE COUCH AND IS PACING THE ROOM]: DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? HASN’T IT BEEN ENOUGH TO SEE YOU KILLING OTHERS WITHOUT MY ALSO KNOWING YOU’LL BE KILLED AS WELL? ISN’T IT ENOUGH TO FEEL YOU HARD AND CRUEL SEETHING WITH BITTERNESS WHEN I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS; TO BREATHE A REEK OF MURDER WHEN YOU LIE ON ME? DAY AFTER DAY I SEE ALL THAT’S HUMAN IN YOU DYING OUT LITTLE BY LITTLE. [SHE TURNS TOWARD HIM.] OH I KNOW. I KNOW I’M GETTING OLD MY BEAUTY’S ON THE WANE. BUT IT’S YOU ONLY I’M CONCERNED FOR NOW; SO MUCH SO THAT I’VE CEASED TROUBLING WHETHER YOU LOVE ME. I ONLY WANT YOU TO GET WELL QUITE WELL AGAIN. YOU’RE STILL A BOY REALLY; YOU’VE A WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU. AND TELL ME WHAT GREATER THING CAN YOU WANT THAN A WHOLE LIFE?

CALIGULA [RISING LOOKS AT HER FIXEDLY]: YOU’VE BEEN WITH ME A LONG TIME NOW A VERY LONG TIME.

CÆSONIA: YES.… BUT YOU’LL KEEP ME WON’T YOU?

CALIGULA: I DON’T KNOW. I ONLY KNOW THAT IF YOU’RE WITH ME STILL IT’S BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE NIGHTS WE’VE HAD TOGETHER NIGHTS OF FIERCE JOYLESS PLEASURE; IT’S BECAUSE YOU ALONE KNOW ME AS I AM. [HE TAKES HER IN HIS ARMS BENDING HER HEAD BACK A LITTLE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND.] I’M TWENTY-NINE. NOT A GREAT AGE REALLY. BUT TODAY WHEN NONE THE LESS MY LIFE SEEMS SO LONG SO CROWDED WITH SCRAPS AND SHREDS OF MY PAST SELVES SO COMPLETE IN FACT YOU REMAIN THE LAST WITNESS. AND I CAN’T AVOID A SORT OF SHAMEFUL TENDERNESS FOR THE OLD WOMAN THAT YOU SOON WILL BE.

CÆSONIA: TELL ME THAT YOU MEAN TO KEEP ME WITH YOU.

CALIGULA: I DON’T KNOW. ALL I KNOW—AND IT’S THE MOST TERRIBLE THING OF ALL—IS THAT THIS SHAMEFUL TENDERNESS IS THE ONE SINCERE EMOTION THAT MY LIFE HAS GIVEN UP TO NOW. [CÆSONIA FREES HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS. CALIGULA FOLLOWS HER. SHE PRESSES HER BACK TO HIS CHEST AND HE PUTS HIS ARMS ROUND HER.] WOULDN’T IT BE BETTER THAT THE LAST WITNESS SHOULD DISAPPEAR?

CÆSONIA: THAT HAS NO IMPORTANCE. ALL I KNOW IS: I’M HAPPY. WHAT YOU’VE JUST SAID HAS MADE ME VERY HAPPY. BUT WHY CAN’T I SHARE MY HAPPINESS WITH YOU?

CALIGULA: WHO SAYS I’M UNHAPPY?

CÆSONIA: HAPPINESS IS KIND. IT DOESN’T THRIVE ON BLOODSHED.

CALIGULA: THEN THERE MUST BE TWO KINDS OF HAPPINESS AND I’VE CHOSEN THE MURDEROUS KIND. FOR I AM HAPPY. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I’D REACHED THE EXTREMITY OF PAIN. BUT NO ONE CAN GO FARTHER YET. BEYOND THE FRONTIER OF PAIN LIES A SPLENDID STERILE HAPPINESS. LOOK AT ME. [SHE TURNS TOWARD HIM.] IT MAKES ME LAUGH CÆSONIA WHEN I THINK HOW FOR YEARS AND YEARS ALL ROME CAREFULLY AVOIDED UTTERING DRUSILLA’S NAME. WELL ALL ROME WAS MISTAKEN. LOVE ISN’T ENOUGH FOR ME; I REALIZED IT THEN. AND I REALIZE IT AGAIN TODAY WHEN I LOOK AT YOU. TO LOVE SOMEONE MEANS THAT ONE’S WILLING TO GROW OLD BESIDE THAT PERSON. THAT SORT OF LOVE IS RIGHT OUTSIDE MY RANGE. DRUSILLA OLD WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE THAN DRUSILLA DEAD. MOST PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT A MAN SUFFERS BECAUSE OUT OF THE BLUE DEATH SNATCHES AWAY THE WOMAN HE LOVES. BUT HIS REAL SUFFERING IS LESS FUTILE; IT COMES FROM THE DISCOVERY THAT GRIEF TOO CANNOT LAST. EVEN GRIEF IS VANITY.
   YOU SEE I HAD NO EXCUSES NOT THE SHADOW OF A REAL LOVE NEITHER BITTERNESS NOR PROFOUND REGRET. NOTHING TO PLEAD IN MY DEFENSE! BUT TODAY—YOU SEE ME STILL FREER THAN I HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS; FREED AS I AM FROM MEMORIES AND ILLUSION. [HE LAUGHS BITTERLY.] I KNOW NOW THAT NOTHING NOTHING LASTS. THINK WHAT THAT KNOWLEDGE MEANS! THERE HAVE BEEN JUST TWO OR THREE OF US IN HISTORY WHO REALLY ACHIEVED THIS FREEDOM THIS CRAZY HAPPINESS. WELL CÆSONIA YOU HAVE SEEN OUT A MOST UNUSUAL DRAMA. IT’S TIME THE CURTAIN FELL FOR YOU.

[HE STANDS BEHIND HER AGAIN LINKING HIS FOREARM ROUND CÆSONIA’S NECK.]

CÆSONIA [TERRIFIED]: NO IT’S IMPOSSIBLE! HOW CAN YOU CALL IT HAPPINESS THIS TERRIFYING FREEDOM?

CALIGULA [GRADUALLY TIGHTENING HIS GRIP ON CÆSONIA’S THROAT]: HAPPINESS IT IS CÆSONIA; I KNOW WHAT I’M SAYING. BUT FOR THIS FREEDOM I’D HAVE BEEN A CONTENTED MAN. THANKS TO IT I HAVE WON THE GODLIKE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE SOLITARY. [HIS EXALTATION GROWS AS LITTLE BY LITTLE HE STRANGLES CÆSONIA WHO PUTS UP NO RESISTANCE BUT HOLDS HER HANDS HALF OPENED LIKE A SUPPLIANT’S BEFORE HER. BENDING HIS HEAD HE GOES ON SPEAKING INTO HER EAR] I LIVE I KILL I EXERCISE THE RAPTUROUS POWER OF A DESTROYER COMPARED WITH WHICH THE POWER OF A CREATOR IS MEREST CHILD’S PLAY. AND THIS THIS IS HAPPINESS; THIS AND NOTHING ELSE—THIS INTOLERABLE RELEASE DEVASTATING SCORN BLOOD HATRED ALL AROUND ME; THE GLORIOUS ISOLATION OF A MAN WHO ALL HIS LIFE LONG NURSES AND GLOATS OVER THE INEFFABLE JOY OF THE UNPUNISHED MURDERER; THE RUTHLESS LOGIC THAT CRUSHES OUT HUMAN LIVES [HE LAUGHS] THAT’S CRUSHING YOURS OUT CÆSONIA SO AS TO PERFECT AT LAST THE UTTER LONELINESS THAT IS MY HEART’S DESIRE.

CÆSONIA [STRUGGLING FEEBLY]: OH CAIUS …

CALIGULA [MORE AND MORE EXCITEDLY]: NO. NO SENTIMENT. I MUST HAVE DONE WITH IT FOR THE TIME IS SHORT. MY TIME IS VERY SHORT DEAR CÆSONIA. [CÆSONIA IS GASPING DYING. CALIGULA DRAGS HER TO THE BED AND LETS HER FALL ON IT. HE STARES WILDLY AT HER; HIS VOICE GROWS HARSH AND GRATING.] YOU TOO WERE GUILTY. BUT KILLING IS NOT THE SOLUTION. [HE SPINS ROUND AND GAZES CRAZILY AT THE MIRROR.] CALIGULA! YOU TOO; YOU TOO ARE GUILTY. THEN WHAT OF IT—A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE LESS? YET WHO CAN CONDEMN ME IN THIS WORLD WHERE THERE IS NO JUDGE WHERE NOBODY IS INNOCENT? [HE BRINGS HIS EYES CLOSE TO HIS REFLECTED FACE. HE SOUNDS GENUINELY DISTRESSED] YOU SEE MY POOR FRIEND. HELICON HAS FAILED YOU. I WON’T HAVE THE MOON. NEVER NEVER NEVER! BUT HOW BITTER IT IS TO KNOW ALL AND TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO THE CONSUMMATION! LISTEN! THAT WAS A SOUND OF WEAPONS. INNOCENCE ARMING FOR THE FRAY—AND INNOCENCE WILL TRIUMPH. WHY AM I NOT IN THEIR PLACE AMONG THEM? AND I’M AFRAID. THAT’S CRUELEST OF ALL AFTER DESPISING OTHERS TO FIND ONESELF AS COWARDLY AS THEY. STILL NO MATTER. FEAR TOO HAS AN END. SOON I SHALL ATTAIN THAT EMPTINESS BEYOND ALL UNDERSTANDING IN WHICH THE HEART HAS REST. [HE STEPS BACK A FEW PACES THEN RETURNS TO THE MIRROR. HE SEEMS CALMER. WHEN HE SPEAKS AGAIN HIS VOICE IS STEADIER LESS SHRILL.]
YET REALLY IT’S QUITE SIMPLE. IF I’D HAD THE MOON IF LOVE WERE ENOUGH ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. BUT WHERE COULD I QUENCH THIS THIRST? WHAT HUMAN HEART WHAT GOD WOULD HAVE FOR ME THE DEPTH OF A GREAT LAKE? [KNEELING WEEPING] THERE’S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD OR IN THE OTHER MADE TO MY STATURE. AND YET I KNOW AND YOU TOO KNOW [STILL WEEPING HE STRETCHES OUT HIS ARMS TOWARD THE MIRROR] THAT ALL I NEED IS FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE. THE IMPOSSIBLE! I’VE SEARCHED FOR IT AT THE CONFINES OF THE WORLD IN THE SECRET PLACES OF MY HEART. I’VE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS [HIS VOICE RISES TO A SCREAM]; SEE I STRETCH OUT MY HANDS BUT IT’S ALWAYS YOU I FIND YOU ONLY CONFRONTING ME AND I’VE COME TO HATE YOU. I HAVE CHOSEN A WRONG PATH A PATH THAT LEADS TO NOTHING. MY FREEDOM ISN’T THE RIGHT ONE.… NOTHING NOTHING YET. OH HOW OPPRESSIVE IS THIS DARKNESS! HELICON HAS NOT COME; WE SHALL BE FOREVER GUILTY. THE AIR TONIGHT IS HEAVY AS THE SUM OF HUMAN SORROWS. [A CLASH OF ARMS AND WHISPERINGS ARE HEARD IN THE WINGS. CALIGULA RISES PICKS UP A STOOL AND RETURNS TO THE MIRROR BREATHING HEAVILY. HE CONTEMPLATES HIMSELF MAKES A SLIGHT LEAP FORWARD AND WATCHING THE SYMMETRICAL MOVEMENT OF HIS REFLECTED SELF HURLS THE STOOL AT IT SCREAMING] TO HISTORY CALIGULA! GO DOWN TO HISTORY! [THE MIRROR BREAKS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT ARMED CONSPIRATORS RUSH IN. CALIGULA SWINGS ROUND TO FACE THEM WITH A MAD LAUGH. SCIPIO AND CHEREA WHO ARE IN FRONT FLING THEMSELVES AT HIM AND STAB HIS FACE WITH THEIR DAGGERS. CALIGULA’S LAUGHTER TURNS TO GASPS. ALL STRIKE HIM HURRIEDLY CONFUSEDLY. IN A LAST GASP LAUGHING AND CHOKING CALIGULA SHRIEKS] I’M STILL ALIVE!

EDITORS’ NOTE

THESE NOTEBOOKS WERE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF ANTOINE ROQUENTIN. THEY ARE PUBLISHED WITHOUT ALTERATION.

THE FIRST SHEET IS UNDATED BUT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE IT WAS WRITTEN SOME WEEKS BEFORE THE DIARY ITSELF. THUS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AROUND THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY 1932 AT THE LATEST.

AT THAT TIME ANTOINE ROQUENTIN AFTER TRAVELLING THROUGH CENTRAL EUROPE NORTH AFRICA AND THE FAR EAST SETTLED IN BOUVILLE FOR THREE YEARS TO CONCLUDE HIS HISTORICAL RESEARCH ON THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON.

THE EDITORS

UNDATED PAGES

THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO WRITE DOWN EVENTS FROM DAY TO DAY. KEEP A DIARY TO SEE CLEARLY—LET NONE OF THE NUANCES OR SMALL HAPPENINGS ESCAPE EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT SEEM TO MEAN NOTHING. AND ABOVE ALL CLASSIFY THEM. I MUST TELL HOW I SEE THIS TABLE THIS STREET THE PEOPLE MY PACKET OF TOBACCO SINCE THOSE ARE THE THINGS WHICH HAVE CHANGED. I MUST DETERMINE THE EXACT EXTENT AND NATURE OF THIS CHANGE.

FOR INSTANCE HERE IS A CARDBOARD BOX HOLDING MY BOTTLE OF INK. I SHOULD TRY TO TELL HOW I SAW IT BEFORE AND NOW HOW I1 WELL IT’S A PARALLELOPIPED RECTANGLE IT OPENS—THAT’S STUPID THERE’S NOTHING I CAN SAY ABOUT IT. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO AVOID I MUST NOT PUT IN STRANGENESS WHERE THERE IS NONE. I THINK THAT IS THE BIG DANGER IN KEEPING A DIARY: YOU EXAGGERATE EVERYTHING. YOU CONTINUALLY FORCE THE TRUTH BECAUSE YOU’RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM ONE MINUTE TO THE NEXT—AND PRECISELY À PROPOS OF THIS BOX OR ANY OTHER OBJECT AT ALL I CAN RECAPTURE THIS IMPRESSION OF DAY-BEFORE-YESTERDAY. I MUST ALWAYS BE READY OTHERWISE IT WILL SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS. I MUST NEVER2 BUT CAREFULLY NOTE AND DETAIL ALL THAT HAPPENS.

NATURALLY I CAN WRITE NOTHING DEFINITE ABOUT THIS SATURDAY AND THE DAY-BEFORE-YESTERDAY BUSINESS. I AM ALREADY TOO FAR FROM IT; THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS THAT IN NEITHER CASE WAS THERE ANYTHING WHICH COULD ORDINARILY BE CALLED AN EVENT. SATURDAY THE CHILDREN WERE PLAYING DUCKS AND DRAKES AND LIKE THEM I WANTED TO THROW A STONE INTO THE SEA. JUST AT THAT MOMENT I STOPPED DROPPED THE STONE AND LEFT. PROBABLY I LOOKED SOMEWHAT FOOLISH OR ABSENT-MINDED BECAUSE THE CHILDREN LAUGHED BEHIND MY BACK.

SO MUCH FOR EXTERNAL THINGS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED INSIDE OF ME HAS NOT LEFT ANY CLEAR TRACES. I SAW SOMETHING WHICH DISGUSTED ME BUT I NO LONGER KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE SEA OR THE STONE. THE STONE WAS FLAT AND DRY ESPECIALLY ON ONE SIDE DAMP AND MUDDY ON THE OTHER. I HELD IT BY THE EDGES WITH MY FINGERS WIDE APART SO AS NOT TO GET THEM DIRTY.

DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY WAS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. AND THERE WAS ALSO THIS SERIES OF COINCIDENCES OF QUID-PRO-QUOS THAT I CAN’T EXPLAIN TO MYSELF. BUT I’M NOT GOING TO SPEND MY TIME PUTTING ALL THAT DOWN ON PAPER. ANYHOW IT WAS CERTAIN THAT I WAS AFRAID OR HAD SOME OTHER FEELING OF THAT SORT. IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF I WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT STEP FORWARD.

THE STRANGEST THING IS THAT I AM NOT AT ALL INCLINED TO CALL MYSELF INSANE I CLEARLY SEE THAT I AM NOT: ALL THESE CHANGES CONCERN OBJECTS. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I’D LIKE TO BE SURE OF.

10.303

PERHAPS IT WAS A PASSING MOMENT OF MADNESS AFTER ALL. THERE IS NO TRACE OF IT ANY MORE. MY ODD FEELINGS OF THE OTHER WEEK SEEM TO ME QUITE RIDICULOUS TODAY: I CAN NO LONGER ENTER INTO THEM. I AM QUITE AT EASE THIS EVENING QUITE SOLIDLY TERRE-À-TERRE IN THE WORLD. HERE IS MY ROOM FACING NORTH-EAST. BELOW THE RUE DES MUTILÉS AND THE CONSTRUCTION-YARD OF THE NEW STATION. FROM MY WINDOW I SEE THE RED AND WHITE FLAME OF THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” AT THE CORNER OF THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR. THE PARIS TRAIN HAS JUST COME IN. PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT OF THE OLD STATION AND SPREADING INTO THE STREETS. I HEAR STEPS AND VOICES. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THE LAST TRAMWAY. THEY MUST MAKE A SAD LITTLE GROUP AROUND THE STREET LIGHT JUST UNDER MY WINDOW. WELL THEY HAVE A FEW MINUTES MORE TO WAIT: THE TRAM WON’T PASS BEFORE 10.45. I HOPE NO COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS WILL COME TO-NIGHT: I HAVE SUCH A DESIRE TO SLEEP AND AM SO MUCH BEHIND IN MY SLEEP. A GOOD NIGHT ONE GOOD NIGHT AND ALL THIS NONSENSE WILL BE SWEPT AWAY.

TEN FORTY-FIVE: NOTHING MORE TO FEAR THEY WOULD BE HERE ALREADY. UNLESS IT’S THE DAY FOR THE MAN FROM ROUEN. HE COMES EVERY WEEK. THEY RESERVE NO. 2 ON THE SECOND FLOOR FOR HIM THE ROOM WITH A BIDET. HE MIGHT STILL SHOW UP: HE OFTEN DRINKS A BEER AT THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” BEFORE GOING TO BED. BUT HE DOESN’T MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE. HE IS VERY SMALL AND CLEAN WITH A WAXED BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A WIG. HERE HE IS NOW.

WELL WHEN I HEARD HIM COME UP THE STAIRS IT GAVE ME QUITE A THRILL IT WAS SO REASSURING: WHAT IS THERE TO FEAR IN SUCH A REGULAR WORLD? I THINK I AM CURED.

HERE IS TRAMWAY NUMBER SEVEN ABATTOIRS-GRANDS BASSINS. IT STOPS WITH A CLANK OF IRON RAILS. IT’S LEAVING AGAIN. NOW LOADED WITH SUITCASES AND SLEEPING CHILDREN IT’S HEADING TOWARDS GRANDS BASSINS TOWARDS THE FACTORIES IN THE BLACK EAST. IT’S THE NEXT TO THE LAST TRAMWAY; THE LAST ONE WILL GO BY IN AN HOUR.

I’M GOING TO BED. I’M CURED. I’LL GIVE UP WRITING MY DAILY IMPRESSIONS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL IN HER NICE NEW NOTEBOOK.

IN ONE CASE ONLY IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO KEEP A DIARY: IT WOULD BE IF . . .4

1 WORD LEFT OUT.

2 WORD CROSSED OUT (POSSIBLY “FORCE” OR “FORGE”) ANOTHER WORD ADDED ABOVE IS ILLEGIBLE.

3 EVIDENTLY IN THE EVENING. THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS MUCH LATER THAN THE PRECEDING ONES. WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE EARLIEST.

4 THE TEXT OF THE UNDATED PAGES ENDS HERE.

MONDAY 29 JANUARY 1932:

SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME I CAN’T DOUBT IT ANY MORE. IT CAME AS AN ILLNESS DOES NOT LIKE AN ORDINARY CERTAINTY NOT LIKE ANYTHING EVIDENT. IT CAME CUNNINGLY LITTLE BY LITTLE; I FELT A LITTLE STRANGE A LITTLE PUT OUT THAT’S ALL. ONCE ESTABLISHED IT NEVER MOVED IT STAYED QUIET AND I WAS ABLE TO PERSUADE MYSELF THAT NOTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH ME THAT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM. AND NOW IT’S BLOSSOMING.

I DON’T THINK THE HISTORIAN’S TRADE IS MUCH GIVEN TO PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. IN OUR WORK WE HAVE TO DO ONLY WITH SENTIMENTS IN THE WHOLE TO WHICH WE GIVE GENERIC TITLES SUCH AS AMBITION AND INTEREST. AND YET IF I HAD EVEN A SHADOW OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE I COULD PUT IT TO GOOD USE NOW.

FOR INSTANCE THERE IS SOMETHING NEW ABOUT MY HANDS A CERTAIN WAY OF PICKING UP MY PIPE OR FORK. OR ELSE IT’S THE FORK WHICH NOW HAS A CERTAIN WAY OF HAVING ITSELF PICKED UP I DON’T KNOW. A LITTLE WHILE AGO JUST AS I WAS COMING INTO MY ROOM I STOPPED SHORT BECAUSE I FELT IN MY HAND A COLD OBJECT WHICH HELD MY ATTENTION THROUGH A SORT OF PERSONALITY. I OPENED MY HAND LOOKED: I WAS SIMPLY HOLDING THE DOOR-KNOB. THIS MORNING IN THE LIBRARY WHEN THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN1 CAME TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO ME IT TOOK ME TEN SECONDS TO RECOGNIZE HIM. I SAW AN UNKNOWN FACE BARELY A FACE. THEN THERE WAS HIS HAND LIKE A FAT WHITE WORM IN MY OWN HAND. I DROPPED IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND THE ARM FELL BACK FLABBILY.

THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF SUSPICIOUS NOISES IN THE STREETS TOO.

SO A CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE DURING THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. BUT WHERE? IT IS AN ABSTRACT CHANGE WITHOUT OBJECT. AM I THE ONE WHO HAS CHANGED? IF NOT THEN IT IS THIS ROOM THIS CITY AND THIS NATURE; I MUST CHOOSE.

IMAGE

I THINK I’M THE ONE WHO HAS CHANGED: THAT’S THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION. ALSO THE MOST UNPLEASANT. BUT I MUST FINALLY REALIZE THAT I AM SUBJECT TO THESE SUDDEN TRANSFORMATIONS. THE THING IS THAT I RARELY THINK; A CROWD OF SMALL METAMORPHOSES ACCUMULATE IN ME WITHOUT MY NOTICING IT AND THEN ONE FINE DAY A VERITABLE REVOLUTION TAKES PLACE. THIS IS WHAT HAS GIVEN MY LIFE SUCH A JERKY INCOHERENT ASPECT. FOR INSTANCE WHEN I LEFT FRANCE THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID I LEFT FOR A WHIM. AND WHEN I SUDDENLY CAME BACK AFTER SIX YEARS OF TRAVELLING THEY STILL COULD CALL IT A WHIM. I SEE MYSELF WITH MERCIER AGAIN IN THE OFFICE OF THAT FRENCH FUNCTIONARY WHO RESIGNED AFTER THE PETROU BUSINESS LAST YEAR. MERCIER WAS GOING TO BENGAL ON AN ARCHEOLOGICAL MISSION. I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO BENGAL AND HE PRESSED ME TO GO WITH HIM. NOW I WONDER WHY. I DON’T THINK HE WAS TOO SURE OF PORTAL AND WAS COUNTING ON ME TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. I SAW NO REASON TO REFUSE. AND EVEN IF I HAD SUSPECTED THAT LITTLE DEAL WITH PORTAL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE MORE REASON TO ACCEPT WITH ENTHUSIASM. WELL I WAS PARALYSED I COULDN’T SAY A WORD. I WAS STARING AT A LITTLE KHMER STATUETTE ON A GREEN CARPET NEXT TO A TELEPHONE. I SEEMED TO BE FULL OF LYMPH OR WARM MILK. WITH ANGELIC PATIENCE VEILING A SLIGHT IRRITATION MERCIER TOLD ME:

“NOW LOOK I HAVE TO BE OFFICIALLY FIXED UP. I KNOW YOU’LL END UP BY SAYING YES SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT RIGHT AWAY.”

HE HAD A REDDISH-BLACK BEARD HEAVILY SCENTED. I GOT A WAFT OF PERFUME AT EACH MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD. AND THEN SUDDENLY I WOKE FROM A SIX-YEAR SLUMBER.

THE STATUE SEEMED TO ME UNPLEASANT AND STUPID AND I FELT TERRIBLY DEEPLY BORED. I COULDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS IN INDO-CHINA. WHAT WAS I DOING THERE? WHY WAS I TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE? WHY WAS I DRESSED SO ODDLY? MY PASSION WAS DEAD. FOR YEARS IT HAD ROLLED OVER AND SUBMERGED ME; NOW I FELT EMPTY. BUT THAT WASN’T THE WORST: BEFORE ME POSED WITH A SORT OF INDOLENCE WAS A VOLUMINOUS INSIPID IDEA. I DID NOT SEE CLEARLY WHAT IT WAS BUT IT SICKENED ME SO MUCH I COULDN’T LOOK AT IT. ALL THAT WAS CONFUSED WITH THE PERFUME OF MERCIER’S BEARD.

I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER CONVULSED WITH ANGER AND ANSWERED DRYLY:

“THANK YOU BUT I BELIEVE I’VE TRAVELLED ENOUGH I MUST GO BACK TO FRANCE NOW.” TWO DAYS LATER I TOOK THE BOAT FOR MARSEILLES.

IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN IF ALL THE SIGNS WHICH HAVE BEEN AMASSED ARE PRECURSORS OF A NEW OVERTHROW IN MY LIFE WELL THEN I AM TERRIFIED. IT ISN’T THAT MY LIFE IS RICH OR WEIGHTY OR PRECIOUS. BUT I’M AFRAID OF WHAT WILL BE BORN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF ME—AND DRAG ME—WHERE? SHALL I HAVE TO GO OFF AGAIN LEAVING MY RESEARCH MY BOOK AND EVERYTHING ELSE UNFINISHED? SHALL I AWAKE IN A FEW MONTHS IN A FEW YEARS BROKEN DECEIVED IN THE MIDST OF NEW RUINS? I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TRUTH CLEARLY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.

TUESDAY 30 JANUARY:

NOTHING NEW.

I WORKED FROM NINE TILL ONE IN THE LIBRARY. I GOT CHAPTER XII STARTED AND ALL THAT CONCERNS ROLLEBON’S STAY IN RUSSIA UP TO THE DEATH OF PAUL I. THIS WORK IS FINISHED: NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH IT UNTIL THE FINAL REVISION.

IT IS ONE-THIRTY. I AM EATING A SANDWICH IN THE CAFÉ MABLY EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS NORMAL. ANYWAY EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS NORMAL IN CAFÉS AND ESPECIALLY THE CAFÉ MABLY BECAUSE OF THE MANAGER M. FASQUELLE WHO HAS A RAFFISH LOOK WHICH IS POSITIVELY REASSURING. IT WILL SOON BE TIME FOR HIS NAP AND HIS EYES ARE PINK ALREADY BUT HE STAYS QUICK AND DECISIVE. HE STROLLS AMONG THE TABLES AND SPEAKS CONFIDENTLY TO THE CUSTOMERS.

“IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT MONSIEUR?”

I SMILE AT SEEING HIM THUS; WHEN HIS PLACE EMPTIES HIS HEAD EMPTIES TOO. FROM TWO TO FOUR THE CAFÉ IS DESERTED THEN M. FASQUELLE TAKES A FEW DAZED STEPS THE WAITERS TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND HE SLIPS INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS: WHEN THIS MAN IS LONELY HE SLEEPS.

THERE ARE STILL ABOUT TWENTY CUSTOMERS LEFT BACHELORS SMALLTIME ENGINEERS OFFICE EMPLOYEES. THEY EAT HURRIEDLY IN BOARDING-HOUSES WHICH THEY CALL THEIR “POPOTES” AND SINCE THEY NEED A LITTLE LUXURY THEY COME HERE AFTER THEIR MEALS. THEY DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE AND PLAY POKER DICE; THEY MAKE A LITTLE NOISE AN INCONSISTENT NOISE WHICH DOESN’T BOTHER ME. IN ORDER TO EXIST THEY ALSO MUST CONSORT WITH OTHERS.

I LIVE ALONE ENTIRELY ALONE. I NEVER SPEAK TO ANYONE NEVER; I RECEIVE NOTHING I GIVE NOTHING. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DOESN’T COUNT. THERE IS FRANÇOISE THE WOMAN WHO RUNS THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS.” BUT DO I SPEAK TO HER? SOMETIMES AFTER DINNER WHEN SHE BRINGS MY BEER I ASK HER:

“HAVE YOU TIME THIS EVENING?”

SHE NEVER SAYS NO AND I FOLLOW HER INTO ONE OF THE BIG ROOMS ON THE SECOND FLOOR SHE RENTS BY THE HOUR OR BY THE DAY. I DO NOT PAY HER: OUR NEED IS MUTUAL. SHE TAKES PLEASURE IN IT (SHE HAS TO HAVE A MAN A DAY AND SHE HAS MANY MORE BESIDES ME) AND THUS I PURGE MYSELF OF A CERTAIN NOSTALGIA THE CAUSE OF WHICH I KNOW TOO WELL. BUT WE HARDLY SPEAK. WHAT GOOD IS IT? EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF: BESIDES AS FAR AS SHE’S CONCERNED I AM PREEMINENTLY A CUSTOMER IN HER CAFÉ. TAKING OFF HER DRESS SHE TELLS ME:

“SAY HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT APÉRITIF BRICOT? BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ASKED FOR SOME THIS WEEK. THE GIRL DIDN’T KNOW AND SHE CAME TO ASK ME. THEY WERE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS THEY MUST HAVE DRUNK THAT IN PARIS. BUT I DON’T LIKE TO BUY WITHOUT KNOWING. I’LL KEEP MY STOCKINGS ON IF YOU DON’T MIND.”

IN THE PAST—EVEN A LONG WHILE AFTER SHE LEFT ME—I THOUGHT ABOUT ANNY. NOW I THINK OF NO ONE ANY MORE. I DON’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING FOR WORDS. IT FLOWS IN ME MORE OR LESS QUICKLY. I FIX NOTHING I LET IT GO. THROUGH THE LACK OF ATTACHING MYSELF TO WORDS MY THOUGHTS REMAIN NEBULOUS MOST OF THE TIME. THEY SKETCH VAGUE PLEASANT SHAPES AND THEN ARE SWALLOWED UP: I FORGET THEM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

I MARVEL AT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE: DRINKING THEIR COFFEE THEY TELL CLEAR PLAUSIBLE STORIES. IF THEY ARE ASKED WHAT THEY DID YESTERDAY THEY AREN’T EMBARRASSED: THEY BRING YOU UP TO DATE IN A FEW WORDS. IF I WERE IN THEIR PLACE I’D FALL OVER MYSELF. IT’S TRUE THAT NO ONE HAS BOTHERED ABOUT HOW I SPEND MY TIME FOR A LONG WHILE. WHEN YOU LIVE ALONE YOU NO LONGER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO TELL SOMETHING: THE PLAUSIBLE DISAPPEARS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE FRIENDS.

YOU LET EVENTS FLOW PAST; SUDDENLY YOU SEE PEOPLE POP UP WHO SPEAK AND WHO GO AWAY YOU PLUNGE INTO STORIES WITHOUT BEGINNING OR END: YOU’D MAKE A TERRIBLE WITNESS. BUT IN COMPENSATION ONE MISSES NOTHING NO IMPROBABILITY OR STORY TOO TALL TO BE BELIEVED IN CAFÉS. FOR EXAMPLE SATURDAY ABOUT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON ON THE END OF THE TIMBERED SIDEWALK OF THE NEW STATION YARD A LITTLE WOMAN IN SKY BLUE WAS RUNNING BACKWARDS LAUGHING WAVING A HANDKERCHIEF. AT THE SAME TIME A NEGRO IN A CREAM-COLOURED RAINCOAT YELLOW SHOES AND A GREEN HAT TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND WHISTLED. STILL GOING BACKWARDS THE WOMAN BUMPED INTO HIM UNDERNEATH A LANTERN WHICH HANGS ON A PALING AND WHICH IS LIT AT NIGHT. ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS THE PALING SMELLING STRONGLY OF WET WOOD THIS LANTERN AND THIS LITTLE BLONDE WOMAN IN THE NEGRO’S ARMS UNDER A SKY THE COLOUR OF FIRE. IF THERE HAD BEEN FOUR OR FIVE OF US I SUPPOSE WE WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE JOLT THE SOFT COLOURS THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE COAT THAT LOOKED LIKE AN EIDERDOWN QUILT THE LIGHT RAINCOAT THE RED PANES OF THE LANTERN; WE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE STUPEFACTION WHICH APPEARED ON THOSE TWO CHILDISH FACES.

A MAN RARELY FEELS LIKE LAUGHING ALONE: THE WHOLE THING WAS ANIMATED ENOUGH FOR ME BUT IT WAS A STRONG EVEN A FIERCE YET PURE SENSATION. THEN EVERYTHING CAME ASUNDER THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT THE LANTERN THE PALISADE AND THE SKY; IT WAS STILL RATHER BEAUTIFUL. AN HOUR LATER THE LANTERN WAS LIT THE WIND BLEW THE SKY WAS BLACK; NOTHING AT ALL WAS LEFT.

ALL THAT IS NOTHING NEW; I HAVE NEVER RESISTED THESE HARMLESS EMOTIONS; FAR FROM IT. YOU MUST BE JUST A LITTLE BIT LONELY IN ORDER TO FEEL THEM JUST LONELY ENOUGH TO GET RID OF PLAUSIBILITY AT THE PROPER TIME. BUT I REMAINED CLOSE TO PEOPLE ON THE SURFACE OF SOLITUDE QUITE RESOLVED TO TAKE REFUGE IN THEIR MIDST IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. UP TO NOW I WAS AN AMATEUR AT HEART.

EVERYWHERE NOW THERE ARE OBJECTS LIKE THIS GLASS OF BEER ON THE TABLE THERE. WHEN I SEE IT I FEEL LIKE SAYING: “ENOUGH.” I REALIZE QUITE WELL THAT I HAVE GONE TOO FAR. I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU CAN “TAKE SIDES” WITH SOLITUDE. THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT I LOOK UNDER MY BED BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP OR THINK I SEE THE DOOR OF MY ROOM OPEN SUDDENLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. STILL SOMEHOW I AM NOT AT PEACE: I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING LOOKING AT THIS GLASS OF BEER FOR HALF AN HOUR. I LOOK ABOVE BELOW RIGHT AND LEFT; BUT I DON’T WANT TO SEE IT. AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT ALL THESE BACHELORS AROUND ME CAN BE OF NO HELP: IT IS TOO LATE I CAN NO LONGER TAKE REFUGE AMONG THEM. THEY COULD COME AND TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAY “WELL WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH THAT GLASS OF BEER?” IT’S JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. IT’S BEVELLED ON THE EDGES HAS A HANDLE A LITTLE COAT OF ARMS WITH A SPADE ON IT AND ON THE COAT OF ARMS IS WRITTEN “SPARTENBRAU” I KNOW ALL THAT BUT I KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE. ALMOST NOTHING. BUT I CAN’T EXPLAIN WHAT I SEE. TO ANYONE. THERE: I AM QUIETLY SLIPPING INTO THE WATER’S DEPTHS TOWARDS FEAR.

I AM ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THESE HAPPY REASONABLE VOICES. ALL THESE CREATURES SPEND THEIR TIME EXPLAINING REALIZING HAPPILY THAT THEY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER. IN HEAVEN’S NAME WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO THINK THE SAME THINGS ALL TOGETHER. IT’S ENOUGH TO SEE THE FACE THEY MAKE WHEN ONE OF THESE FISHY-EYED MEN WITH AN INWARD LOOK AND WITH WHOM NO AGREEMENT IS POSSIBLE PASSES THEM. WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND USED TO PLAY IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS THERE WAS A MAN WHO CAME AND SAT IN A SENTRY-BOX AGAINST THE IRON FENCE WHICH RUNS ALONG THE RUE AUGUSTE-COMTE. HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT FROM TIME TO TIME STRETCHED OUT HIS LEG AND LOOKED AT HIS FOOT FEARFULLY. THE FOOT WAS ENCASED IN A BOOT BUT THE OTHER ONE WAS IN A SLIPPER. THE GUARD TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THE MAN WAS A FORMER PROCTOR. THEY RETIRED HIM BECAUSE HE USED TO COME DRESSED UP AS AN ACADEMICIAN TO READ THE SCHOOL TERM MARKS. WE HAD A HORRIBLE FEAR OF HIM BECAUSE WE SENSED HE WAS ALONE. ONE DAY HE SMILED AT ROBERT HOLDING OUT HIS ARMS TO HIM FROM A DISTANCE: ROBERT ALMOST FAINTED. IT WASN’T THIS CREATURE’S POVERTY-STRICKEN LOOK WHICH FRIGHTENED US NOR THE TUMOUR HE HAD ON HIS NECK THAT RUBBED AGAINST THE EDGE OF HIS COLLAR: BUT WE FELT THAT HE WAS SHAPING THOUGHTS OF CRAB OR LOBSTER IN HIS HEAD. AND THAT TERRIFIED US THE FACT THAT ONE COULD CONJURE THOUGHTS OF LOBSTERS ON THE SENTRY-BOX ON OUR HOOPS ON THE BUSHES.

IS THAT WHAT AWAITS ME THEN? FOR THE FIRST TIME I AM DISTURBED AT BEING ALONE. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL SOMEONE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE AND BEFORE I START FRIGHTENING LITTLE BOYS. I WISH ANNY WERE HERE.

THIS IS ODD: I HAVE JUST FILLED UP TEN PAGES AND I HAVEN’T TOLD THE TRUTH—AT LEAST NOT THE WHOLE TRUTH. I WAS WRITING “NOTHING NEW” WITH A BAD CONSCIENCE: AS A MATTER OF FACT I BOGGLED AT BRINGING OUT A QUITE HARMLESS LITTLE INCIDENT. “NOTHING NEW.” I ADMIRE THE WAY WE CAN LIE PUTTING REASON ON OUR SIDE. EVIDENTLY NOTHING NEW HAS HAPPENED IF YOU CARE TO PUT IT THAT WAY: THIS MORNING AT EIGHT-FIFTEEN JUST AS I WAS LEAVING THE HOTEL PRINTANIA TO GO TO THE LIBRARY I WANTED TO AND COULD NOT PICK UP A PAPER LYING ON THE GROUND. THIS IS ALL AND IT IS NOT EVEN AN EVENT. YES—BUT TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH I WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY IT: I FELT I WAS NO LONGER FREE. I TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO GET RID OF THIS IDEA AT THE LIBRARY. I WANTED TO ESCAPE FROM IT AT THE CAFÉ MABLY. I HOPED IT WOULD DISAPPEAR IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT. BUT IT STAYED THERE LIKE A DEAD WEIGHT INSIDE ME. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRECEDING PAGES.

WHY DIDN’T I MENTION IT? IT MUST BE OUT OF PRIDE AND THEN TOO A LITTLE OUT OF AWKWARDNESS. I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF TELLING MYSELF WHAT HAPPENS TO ME SO I CANNOT QUITE RECAPTURE THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS I CANNOT DISTINGUISH WHAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT NOW IT IS FINISHED: I HAVE RE-READ WHAT I WROTE IN THE CAFÉ MABLY AND I AM ASHAMED; I WANT NO SECRETS OR SOUL-STATES NOTHING INEFFABLE; I AM NEITHER VIRGIN NOR PRIEST ENOUGH TO PLAY WITH THE INNER LIFE.

THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO SAY: I COULD NOT PICK UP THE PAPER THAT’S ALL.

I VERY MUCH LIKE TO PICK UP CHESTNUTS OLD RAGS AND ESPECIALLY PAPERS. IT IS PLEASANT TO ME TO PICK THEM UP TO CLOSE MY HAND ON THEM; WITH A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT I WOULD CARRY THEM TO MY MOUTH THE WAY CHILDREN DO. ANNY WENT INTO A WHITE RAGE WHEN I PICKED UP THE CORNERS OF HEAVY SUMPTUOUS PAPERS PROBABLY SOILED BY EXCREMENT. IN SUMMER OR THE BEGINNING OF AUTUMN YOU CAN FIND REMNANTS OF SUN-BAKED NEWSPAPERS IN GARDENS DRY AND FRAGILE AS DEAD LEAVES SO YELLOW YOU MIGHT THINK THEY HAD BEEN WASHED WITH PICRIC ACID. IN WINTER SOME PAGES ARE POUNDED TO PULP; CRUSHED STAINED THEY RETURN TO THE EARTH. OTHERS QUITE NEW WHEN COVERED WITH ICE ALL WHITE ALL THROBBING ARE LIKE SWANS ABOUT TO FLY BUT THE EARTH HAS ALREADY CAUGHT THEM FROM BELOW. THEY TWIST AND TEAR THEMSELVES FROM THE MUD ONLY TO BE FINALLY FLATTENED OUT A LITTLE FURTHER ON. IT IS GOOD TO PICK UP ALL THAT. SOMETIMES I SIMPLY FEEL THEM LOOKING AT THEM CLOSELY; OTHER TIMES I TEAR THEM TO HEAR THEIR DRAWN-OUT CRACKLING OR IF THEY ARE DAMP I LIGHT THEM NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY; THEN I WIPE MY MUDDY HANDS ON A WALL OR TREE TRUNK.

SO TODAY I WAS WATCHING THE RIDING BOOTS OF A CAVALRY OFFICER WHO WAS LEAVING HIS BARRACKS. AS I FOLLOWED THEM WITH MY EYES I SAW A PIECE OF PAPER LYING BESIDE A PUDDLE. I THOUGHT THE OFFICER WAS GOING TO CRUSH THE PAPER INTO THE MUD WITH HIS HEEL BUT NO: HE STRADDLED PAPER AND PUDDLE IN A SINGLE STEP. I WENT UP TO IT: IT WAS A LINED PAGE UNDOUBTEDLY TORN FROM A SCHOOL NOTEBOOK. THE RAIN HAD DRENCHED AND TWISTED IT IT WAS COVERED WITH BLISTERS AND SWELLINGS LIKE A BURNED HAND. THE RED LINE OF THE MARGIN WAS SMEARED INTO A PINK SPLOTCH; INK HAD RUN IN PLACES. THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE DISAPPEARED BENEATH A CRUST OF MUD. I BENT DOWN ALREADY REJOICING AT THE TOUCH OF THIS PULP FRESH AND TENDER WHICH I SHOULD ROLL IN MY FINGERS INTO GREYISH BALLS

I WAS UNABLE.

I STAYED BENT DOWN FOR A SECOND I READ “DICTATION: THE WHITE OWL” THEN I STRAIGHTENED UP EMPTY-HANDED. I AM NO LONGER FREE I CAN NO LONGER DO WHAT I WILL.

OBJECTS SHOULD NOT TOUCH BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALIVE. YOU USE THEM PUT THEM BACK IN PLACE YOU LIVE AMONG THEM: THEY ARE USEFUL NOTHING MORE. BUT THEY TOUCH ME IT IS UNBEARABLE. I AM AFRAID OF BEING IN CONTACT WITH THEM AS THOUGH THEY WERE LIVING BEASTS.

NOW I SEE: I RECALL BETTER WHAT I FELT THE OTHER DAY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN I HELD THE PEBBLE. IT WAS A SORT OF SWEETISH SICKNESS. HOW UNPLEASANT IT WAS! IT CAME FROM THE STONE I’M SURE OF IT IT PASSED FROM THE STONE TO MY HAND. YES THAT’S IT THAT’S JUST IT—A SORT OF NAUSEA IN THE HANDS.

THURSDAY MORNING IN THE LIBRARY:

A LITTLE WHILE AGO GOING DOWN THE HOTEL STAIRS I HEARD LUCIE WHO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME WAS COMPLAINING TO THE LANDLADY WHILE POLISHING THE STEPS. THE PROPRIETRESS SPOKE WITH DIFFICULTY USING SHORT SENTENCES BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT PUT IN HER FALSE TEETH; SHE WAS ALMOST NAKED IN A PINK DRESSING-GOWN AND TURKISH SLIPPERS. LUCIE WAS DIRTY AS USUAL; FROM TIME TO TIME SHE STOPPED RUBBING AND STRAIGHTENED UP ON HER KNEES TO LOOK AT THE PROPRIETRESS. SHE SPOKE WITHOUT PAUSING REASONABLY:

“I’D LIKE IT A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER IF HE WENT WITH OTHER WOMEN” SHE SAID “IT WOULDN’T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE TO ME SO LONG AS IT DIDN’T DO HIM ANY HARM.”

SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND: AT FORTY THIS SWARTHY LITTLE WOMAN HAD OFFERED HERSELF AND HER SAVINGS TO A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN A FITTER IN THE USINES LECOINTE. SHE HAS AN UNHAPPY HOME LIFE. HER HUSBAND DOES NOT BEAT HER IS NOT UNFAITHFUL TO HER BUT HE DRINKS HE COMES HOME DRUNK EVERY EVENING. HE’S BURNING HIS CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS; IN THREE MONTHS I HAVE SEEN HIM TURN YELLOW AND MELT AWAY. LUCIE THINKS IT IS DRINK. I BELIEVE HE IS TUBERCULAR.

“YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE UPPER HAND” LUCIE SAID.

IT GNAWS AT HER I’M SURE OF IT BUT SLOWLY PATIENTLY: SHE TAKES THE UPPER HAND SHE IS ABLE NEITHER TO CONSOLE HERSELF NOR ABANDON HERSELF TO HER SUFFERING. SHE THINKS ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT A VERY LITTLE BIT NOW AND AGAIN SHE PASSES IT ON. ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE IS WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CONSOLE HER AND ALSO BECAUSE IT COMFORTS HER A LITTLE TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH POISE WITH AN AIR OF GIVING ADVICE. WHEN SHE IS ALONE IN THE ROOMS I HEAR HER HUMMING TO KEEP HERSELF FROM THINKING. BUT SHE IS MOROSE ALL DAY SUDDENLY WEARY AND SULLEN.

“IT’S THERE” SHE SAYS TOUCHING HER THROAT “IT WON’T GO DOWN.”

SHE SUFFERS AS A MISER. SHE MUST BE MISERLY WITH HER PLEASURES AS WELL. I WONDER IF SOMETIMES SHE DOESN’T WISH SHE WERE FREE OF THIS MONOTONOUS SORROW OF THESE MUTTERINGS WHICH START AS SOON AS SHE STOPS SINGING IF SHE DOESN’T WISH TO SUFFER ONCE AND FOR ALL TO DROWN HERSELF IN DESPAIR. IN ANY CASE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER: SHE IS BOUND.

THURSDAY AFTERNOON:

“M. DE ROLLEBON WAS QUITE UGLY. QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE CALLED HIM HER ‘DEAR APE.’ YET HE HAD ALL THE LADIES OF THE COURT BUT NOT BY CLOWNING LIKE VOISENON THE BABOON: BUT BY A MAGNETISM WHICH CARRIED HIS LOVELY VICTIMS TO THE WORST EXCESSES OF PASSION. HE INTRIGUES PLAYS A FAIRLY SUSPECT ROLE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE QUEEN’S NECKLACE AND DISAPPEARS IN 1790 AFTER HAVING DEALINGS WITH MIRABEAU-TONNEAU AND NERCIAT. HE TURNS UP AGAIN IN RUSSIA WHERE HE ATTEMPTS TO ASSASSINATE PAUL I AND FROM THERE HE TRAVELS TO THE FARTHEST COUNTRIES; THE INDIES CHINA TURKESTAN. HE SMUGGLES PLOTS SPIES. IN 1813 HE RETURNS TO PARIS. BY 1816 HE HAS BECOME ALL-POWERFUL: HE IS THE SOLE CONFIDANT OF THE DUCHESS D’ANGOULÊME. THIS CAPRICIOUS OLD WOMAN OBSESSED BY HORRIBLE CHILDHOOD MEMORIES GROWS CALM AND SMILES WHEN SHE SEES HIM. THROUGH HER HE WORKS HIS WILL AT COURT. IN MARCH 1820 HE MARRIES MLLE DE ROQUELAURE A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF EIGHTEEN. M. DE ROLLEBON IS SEVENTY; HE IS AT THE HEIGHT OF DISTINCTION AT THE APOGEE OF HIS LIFE. SEVEN MONTHS LATER ACCUSED OF TREASON HE IS ARRESTED THROWN INTO A CELL WHERE HE DIES AFTER FIVE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT EVER BEING BROUGHT TO TRIAL.”

I RE-READ WITH MELANCHOLY THIS NOTE OF GERMAIN BERGER.2

IT WAS BY THOSE FEW LINES THAT I FIRST KNEW M. DE ROLLEBON. HOW ATTRACTIVE HE SEEMED AND HOW I LOVED HIM AFTER THESE FEW WORDS! IT IS FOR HIM FOR THIS MANNIKIN THAT I AM HERE. WHEN I CAME BACK FROM MY TRIP I COULD JUST AS WELL HAVE SETTLED DOWN IN PARIS OR MARSEILLES. BUT MOST OF THE DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE MARQUIS’ LONG STAYS IN FRANCE ARE IN THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY OF BOUVILLE. ROLLEBON WAS THE LORD OF THE MANOR OF MARMOMMES. BEFORE THE WAR YOU COULD STILL FIND ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS IN THIS LITTLE TOWN AN ARCHITECT NAMED ROLLEBON-CAMPOUYRE’ WHO AT HIS DEATH IN 1912 LEFT AN IMPORTANT LEGACY TO THE BOUVILLE LIBRARY: LETTERS OF THE MARQUIS THE FRAGMENT OF A JOURNAL AND ALL SORTS OF PAPERS. I HAVE NOT YET GONE THROUGH IT ALL.

I AM GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THESE NOTES. I HAD NOT READ THEM FOR TEN YEARS. MY HANDWRITING HAS CHANGED OR SO IT SEEMS TO ME; I USED TO WRITE IN A SMALLER HAND. HOW I LOVED M. DE ROLLEBON THAT YEAR! I REMEMBER ONE EVENING—A TUESDAY EVENING: I HAD WORKED ALL DAY IN THE MAZARINE; I HAD JUST GATHERED FROM HIS CORRESPONDENCE OF 1789–90 IN WHAT A MAGISTERIAL WAY HE DUPED NERCIAT. IT WAS DARK I WAS GOING DOWN THE AVENUE DU MAINE AND I BOUGHT SOME CHESTNUTS AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DE LA GAÎTÉ. WAS I HAPPY! I LAUGHED ALL BY MYSELF THINKING OF THE FACE NERCIAT MUST HAVE MADE WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM GERMANY. THE FACE OF THE MARQUIS IS LIKE THIS INK: IT HAS PALED CONSIDERABLY SINCE I HAVE WORKED OVER IT.

IN THE FIRST PLACE STARTING FROM 1801 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING MORE ABOUT HIS CONDUCT. IT IS NOT THE LACK OF DOCUMENTS: LETTERS FRAGMENTS OF MEMOIRS SECRET REPORTS POLICE RECORDS. ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE ALMOST TOO MANY OF THEM. WHAT IS LACKING IN ALL THIS TESTIMONY IS FIRMNESS AND CONSISTENCY. THEY DO NOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER NEITHER DO THEY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER; THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME PERSON. AND YET OTHER HISTORIANS WORK FROM THE SAME SOURCES OF INFORMATION. HOW DO THEY DO IT? AM I MORE SCRUPULOUS OR LESS INTELLIGENT? IN ANY CASE THE QUESTION LEAVES ME COMPLETELY COLD. IN TRUTH WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? I DON’T KNOW. FOR A LONG TIME ROLLEBON THE MAN HAS INTERESTED ME MORE THAN THE BOOK TO BE WRITTEN. BUT NOW THE MAN . . . THE MAN BEGINS TO BORE ME. IT IS THE BOOK WHICH ATTRACTS ME. I FEEL MORE AND MORE NEED TO WRITE—IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS I GROW OLD YOU MIGHT SAY.

EVIDENTLY IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT ROLLEBON TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PAUL I THAT HE THEN ACCEPTED AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPIONAGE MISSION TO THE ORIENT FROM THE CZAR AND CONSTANTLY BETRAYED ALEXANDER TO THE ADVANTAGE OF NAPOLEON. AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS ABLE TO CARRY ON AN ACTIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE COMTE D’ARTOIS AND SEND HIM UNIMPORTANT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO CONVINCE HIM OF HIS FIDELITY: NONE OF ALL THAT IS IMPROBABLE; FOUCHÉ AT THE SAME TIME WAS PLAYING A COMEDY MUCH MORE DANGEROUS AND COMPLEX. PERHAPS THE MARQUIS ALSO CARRIED ON A RIFLE-SUPPLYING BUSINESS WITH THE ASIATIC PRINCIPALITIES FOR HIS OWN PROFIT.

WELL YES: HE COULD HAVE DONE ALL THAT BUT IT IS NOT PROVED: I AM BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT NOTHING CAN EVER BE PROVED. THESE ARE HONEST HYPOTHESES WHICH TAKE THE FACTS INTO ACCOUNT: BUT I SENSE SO DEFINITELY THAT THEY COME FROM ME AND THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY A WAY OF UNIFYING MY OWN KNOWLEDGE. NOT A GLIMMER COMES FROM ROLLEBON’S SIDE. SLOW LAZY SULKY THE FACTS ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE RIGOUR OF THE ORDER I WISH TO GIVE THEM; BUT IT REMAINS OUTSIDE OF THEM. I HAVE THE FEELING OF DOING A WORK OF PURE IMAGINATION. AND I AM CERTAIN THAT THE CHARACTERS IN A NOVEL WOULD HAVE A MORE GENUINE APPEARANCE OR IN ANY CASE WOULD BE MORE AGREEABLE.

FRIDAY:

THREE O’CLOCK. THREE O’CLOCK IS ALWAYS TOO LATE OR TOO EARLY FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. AN ODD MOMENT IN THE AFTERNOON. TODAY IT IS INTOLERABLE.

A COLD SUN WHITENS THE DUST ON THE WINDOW-PANES. PALE SKY CLOUDED WITH WHITE. THE GUTTERS WERE FROZEN THIS MORNING.

I RUMINATE HEAVILY NEAR THE GAS STOVE; I KNOW IN ADVANCE THE DAY IS LOST. I SHALL DO NOTHING GOOD EXCEPT PERHAPS AFTER NIGHTFALL. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE SUN; IT EPHEMERALLY TOUCHES THE DIRTY WHITE WISPS OF FOG WHICH FLOAT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CONSTRUCTION-YARDS IT FLOWS INTO MY ROOM ALL GOLD ALL PALE IT SPREADS FOUR DULL FALSE REFLECTIONS ON MY TABLE.

MY PIPE IS DAUBED WITH A GOLDEN VARNISH WHICH FIRST CATCHES THE EYE BY ITS BRIGHT APPEARANCE; YOU LOOK AT IT AND THE VARNISH MELTS NOTHING IS LEFT BUT A GREAT DULL STREAK ON A PIECE OF WOOD. EVERYTHING IS LIKE THAT EVERYTHING EVEN MY HANDS. WHEN THE SUN BEGINS SHINING LIKE THAT THE BEST THING TO DO IS GO TO BED. ONLY I SLEPT LIKE A LOG LAST NIGHT AND I AM NOT SLEEPY.

I LIKED YESTERDAY’S SKY SO MUCH A NARROW SKY BLACK WITH RAIN PUSHING AGAINST THE WINDOWS LIKE A RIDICULOUS TOUCHING FACE. THIS SUN IS NOT RIDICULOUS QUITE THE CONTRARY. ON EVERYTHING I LIKE ON THE RUST OF THE CONSTRUCTION GIRDERS ON THE ROTTEN BOARDS OF THE FENCE A MISERLY UNCERTAIN LIGHT FALLS LIKE THE LOOK YOU GIVE AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT ON DECISIONS MADE WITH ENTHUSIASM THE DAY BEFORE ON PAGES YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN ONE SPURT WITHOUT CROSSING OUT A WORD. THE FOUR CAFÉS ON THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR SHINING IN THE NIGHT SIDE BY SIDE AND WHICH ARE MUCH MORE THAN CAFÉS—AQUARIUMS SHIPS STARS OR GREAT WHITE EYES—HAVE LOST THEIR AMBIGUOUS CHARM.

A PERFECT DAY TO TURN BACK TO ONE’S SELF: THESE COLD CLARITIES WHICH THE SUN PROJECTS LIKE A JUDGMENT SHORN OF PITY OVER ALL CREATURES—ENTER THROUGH MY EYES; I AM ILLUMINATED WITHIN BY A DIMINISHING LIGHT. I AM SURE THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES WOULD BE ENOUGH TO REACH SUPREME SELF-CONTEMPT. NO THANK YOU I WANT NONE OF THAT. NEITHER SHALL I RE-READ WHAT I WROTE YESTERDAY ON ROLLEBON’S STAY IN ST. PETERSBURG. I STAY SEATED MY ARMS HANGING OR WRITE A FEW WORDS WITHOUT COURAGE: I YAWN I WAIT FOR NIGHT TO COME. WHEN IT IS DARK THE OBJECTS AND I WILL COME OUT OF LIMBO.

DID ROLLEBON OR DID HE NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ASSASSINATION OF PAUL I? THAT IS THE QUESTION FOR TODAY: I AM THAT FAR AND CAN’T GO ON WITHOUT DECIDING.

ACCORDING TO TCHERKOFF HE WAS PAID BY COUNT PAHLEN. MOST OF THE OTHER CONSPIRATORS TCHERKOFF SAYS WERE CONTENT WITH DEPOSING AND IMPRISONING THE CZAR. IN FACT ALEXANDER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A PARTISAN OF THAT SOLUTION. BUT PAHLEN IT WAS ALLEGED WANTED TO DO AWAY WITH PAUL COMPLETELY AND M. DE ROLLEBON WAS CHARGED WITH PERSUADING THE INDIVIDUAL CONSPIRATORS TO THE ASSASSINATION.

“HE VISITED EACH ONE OF THEM AND WITH AN INCOMPARABLE POWER MIMED THE SCENE WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE. THUS HE CAUSED TO BE BORN OR DEVELOPED IN THEM A MADNESS FOR MURDER.”

BUT I SUSPECT TCHERKOFF. HE IS NOT A REASONABLE WITNESS HE IS A HALF-MAD SADISTIC MAGICIAN: HE TURNS EVERYTHING INTO THE DEMONIACAL. I CANNOT SEE M. DE ROLLEBON IN THIS MELODRAMATIC ROLE OR AS MIMIC OF THE ASSASSINATION SCENE! NEVER ON YOUR LIFE! HE IS COLD NOT CARRIED AWAY: HE EXPOSES NOTHING HE INSINUATES AND HIS METHOD PALE AND COLOURLESS CAN SUCCEED ONLY WITH MEN OF HIS OWN LEVEL INTRIGUERS ACCESSIBLE TO REASON POLITICIANS.

“ADHÈMAR DE ROLLEBON” WRITES MME DE CHARRIÈRES “PAINTED NOTHING WITH WORDS MADE NO GESTURES NEVER ALTERED THE TONE OF HIS VOICE. HE KEPT HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED AND ONE COULD BARELY MAKE OUT BETWEEN HIS LASHES THE LOWEST RIM OF HIS GREY IRIS. IT HAS ONLY BEEN WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT I DARE CONFESS HE BORED ME BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE LIMITS. HE SPOKE A LITTLE IN THE WAY ABBÉ MABLY USED TO WRITE.”

AND THIS IS THE MAN WHO BY HIS TALENT FOR MIMICRY? . . . BUT THEN HOW WAS HE ABLE TO CHARM WOMEN? THEN THERE IS THIS CURIOUS STORY SÉGUR REPORTS AND WHICH SEEMS TRUE TO ME.

“IN 1787 AT AN INN NEAR MOULINS AN OLD MAN WAS DYING A FRIEND OF DIDEROT TRAINED BY THE PHILOSOPHERS. THE PRIESTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WERE NONPLUSSED: THEY HAD TRIED EVERYTHING IN VAIN; THE GOOD MAN WOULD HAVE NO LAST RITES HE WAS A PANTHEIST. M. DE ROLLEBON WHO WAS PASSING BY AND WHO BELIEVED IN NOTHING BET THE CURÉ OF MOULINS THAT HE WOULD NEED LESS THAN TWO HOURS TO BRING THE SICK MAN BACK TO CHRISTIAN SENTIMENTS. THE CURÉ TOOK THE BET AND LOST: ROLLEBON BEGAN AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SICK MAN CONFESSED AT FIVE AND DIED AT SEVEN. “ARE YOU SO FORCEFUL IN ARGUMENT?” ASKED THE CURÉ “YOU OUTDO EVEN US.” “I DID NOT ARGUE” ANSWERED M. DE ROLLEBON “I MADE HIM FEAR HELL.”

HOW DID HE TAKE AN EFFECTIVE PART IN THE ASSASSINATION? THAT EVENING ONE OF HIS OFFICER FRIENDS CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS DOOR. IF HE HAD GONE OUT AGAIN HOW COULD HE HAVE CROSSED ST. PETERSBURG WITHOUT TROUBLE? PAUL HALF-INSANE HAD GIVEN THE ORDER THAT AFTER NINE O’CLOCK AT NIGHT ALL PASSERS EXCEPT MIDWIVES AND DOCTORS WERE TO BE ARRESTED. CAN WE BELIEVE THE ABSURD LEGEND THAT ROLLEBON DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A MIDWIFE TO GET AS FAR AS THE PALACE? AFTER ALL HE WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF IT. IN ANY CASE HE WAS NOT AT HOME ON THE NIGHT OF THE ASSASSINATION THAT SEEMS PROVED. ALEXANDER MUST HAVE SUSPECTED HIM STRONGLY SINCE ONE OF HIS OFFICIAL ACTS WAS TO SEND THE MARQUIS AWAY ON THE VAGUE PRETEXT OF A MISSION TO THE FAR EAST.

M. DE ROLLEBON BORES ME TO TEARS. I GET UP. I MOVE THROUGH THIS PALE LIGHT; I SEE IT CHANGE BENEATH MY HANDS AND ON THE SLEEVES OF MY COAT: I CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW MUCH IT DISGUSTS ME. I YAWN. I LIGHT THE LAMP ON THE TABLE: PERHAPS ITS LIGHT WILL BE ABLE TO COMBAT THE LIGHT OF DAY. BUT NO: THE LAMP MAKES NOTHING MORE THAN A PITIFUL POND AROUND ITS BASE. I TURN IT OUT; I GET UP. THERE IS A WHITE HOLE IN THE WALL A MIRROR. IT IS A TRAP. I KNOW I AM GOING TO LET MYSELF BE CAUGHT IN IT. I HAVE. THE GREY THING APPEARS IN THE MIRROR. I GO OVER AND LOOK AT IT I CAN NO LONGER GET AWAY.

IT IS THE REFLECTION OF MY FACE. OFTEN IN THESE LOST DAYS I STUDY IT. I CAN UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF THIS FACE. THE FACES OF OTHERS HAVE SOME SENSE SOME DIRECTION. NOT MINE. I CANNOT EVEN DECIDE WHETHER IT IS HANDSOME OR UGLY. I THINK IT IS UGLY BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TOLD SO. BUT IT DOESN’T STRIKE ME. AT HEART I AM EVEN SHOCKED THAT ANYONE CAN ATTRIBUTE QUALITIES OF THIS KIND TO IT AS IF YOU CALLED A CLOD OF EARTH OR A BLOCK OF STONE BEAUTIFUL OR UGLY.

STILL THERE IS ONE THING WHICH IS PLEASING TO SEE ABOVE THE FLABBY CHEEKS ABOVE THE FOREHEAD; IT IS THE BEAUTIFUL RED FLAME WHICH CROWNS MY HEAD IT IS MY HAIR. THAT IS PLEASANT TO SEE. ANYHOW IT IS A DEFINITE COLOUR: I AM GLAD I HAVE RED HAIR. THERE IT IS IN THE MIRROR IT MAKES ITSELF SEEN IT SHINES. I AM STILL LUCKY: IF MY FOREHEAD WAS SURMOUNTED BY ONE OF THOSE NEUTRAL HEADS OF HAIR WHICH ARE NEITHER CHESTNUT NOR BLOND MY FACE WOULD BE LOST IN VAGUENESS IT WOULD MAKE ME DIZZY.

MY GLANCE SLOWLY AND WEARILY TRAVELS OVER MY FOREHEAD MY CHEEKS: IT FINDS NOTHING FIRM IT IS STRANDED. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A NOSE TWO EYES AND A MOUTH BUT NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE THERE IS NOT EVEN A HUMAN EXPRESSION. YET ANNY AND VÉLINES THOUGHT I LOOKED SO ALIVE: PERHAPS I AM TOO USED TO MY FACE. WHEN I WAS LITTLE MY AUNT BIGEOIS TOLD ME “IF YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF TOO LONG IN THE MIRROR YOU’LL SEE A MONKEY.” I MUST HAVE LOOKED AT MYSELF EVEN LONGER THAN THAT: WHAT I SEE IS WELL BELOW THE MONKEY ON THE FRINGE OF THE VEGETABLE WORLD AT THE LEVEL OF JELLYFISH. IT IS ALIVE I CAN’T SAY IT ISN’T; BUT THIS WAS NOT THE LIFE THAT ANNY CONTEMPLATED: I SEE A SLIGHT TREMOR I SEE THE INSIPID FLESH BLOSSOMING AND PALPITATING WITH ABANDON. THE EYES ESPECIALLY ARE HORRIBLE SEEN SO CLOSE. THEY ARE GLASSY SOFT BLIND RED-RIMMED THEY LOOK LIKE FISH SCALES.

I LEAN ALL MY WEIGHT ON THE PORCELAIN LEDGE I DRAW MY FACE CLOSER UNTIL IT TOUCHES THE MIRROR. THE EYES NOSE AND MOUTH DISAPPEAR: NOTHING HUMAN IS LEFT. BROWN WRINKLES SHOW ON EACH SIDE OF THE FEVERISH SWELLED LIPS CREVICES MOLE HOLES. A SILKY WHITE DOWN COVERS THE GREAT SLOPES OF THE CHEEKS TWO HAIRS PROTRUDE FROM THE NOSTRILS: IT IS A GEOLOGICAL EMBOSSED MAP. AND IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THIS LUNAR WORLD IS FAMILIAR TO ME. I CANNOT SAY I RECOGNIZE THE DETAILS. BUT THE WHOLE THING GIVES ME AN IMPRESSION OF SOMETHING SEEN BEFORE WHICH STUPEFIES ME: I SLIP QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP.

I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE HOLD OF MYSELF: AN ACUTE VIVID SENSATION WOULD DELIVER ME. I PLASTER MY LEFT HAND AGAINST MY CHEEK I PULL THE SKIN; I GRIMACE AT MYSELF. AN ENTIRE HALF OF MY FACE YIELDS THE LEFT HALF OF THE MOUTH TWISTS AND SWELLS UNCOVERING A TOOTH THE EYE OPENS ON A WHITE GLOBE ON PINK BLEEDING FLESH. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR: NOTHING STRONG NOTHING NEW; SOFT FLACCID STALE! I GO TO SLEEP WITH MY EYES OPEN ALREADY THE FACE IS GROWING LARGER GROWING IN THE MIRROR AN IMMENSE LIGHT HALO GLIDING IN THE LIGHT. . . .

I LOSE MY BALANCE AND THAT WAKES ME. I FIND MYSELF STRADDLING A CHAIR STILL DAZED. DO OTHER MEN HAVE AS MUCH DIFFICULTY IN APPRAISING THEIR FACE? IT SEEMS THAT I SEE MY OWN AS I FEEL MY BODY THROUGH A DUMB ORGANIC SENSE. BUT THE OTHERS? ROLLEBON FOR EXAMPLE WAS HE ALSO PUT TO SLEEP BY LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AT WHAT MME DE GENLIS CALLS “HIS SMALL WRINKLED COUNTENANCE CLEAN AND SHARP ALL PITTED WITH SMALLPOX IN WHICH THERE WAS A STRANGE MALICE WHICH CAUGHT THE EYE NO MATTER WHAT EFFORT HE MADE TO DISSEMBLE IT? HE TOOK” SHE ADDS “GREAT CARE WITH HIS COIFFURE AND I NEVER SAW HIM WITHOUT HIS WIG. BUT HIS CHEEKS WERE BLUE VERGING ON BLACK OWING TO HIS HEAVY BEARD WHICH HE SHAVED HIMSELF NOT BEING AT ALL EXPERT. IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO WASH HIS FACE WITH WHITE LEAD IN THE MANNER OF GRIMM. M. DE DANGEVILLE SAID THAT WITH ALL THIS WHITE AND ALL THIS BLUE HE LOOKED LIKE A ROQUEFORT CHEESE”.

IT SEEMS TO ME HE MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASING. BUT AFTER ALL THIS IS NOT THE WAY HE APPEARED TO MME DE CHARRIÈRES. I BELIEVE SHE FOUND HIM RATHER WORN. PERHAPS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND ONE’S OWN FACE. OR PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE I AM A SINGLE MAN? PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SOCIETY HAVE LEARNED HOW TO SEE THEMSELVES IN MIRRORS AS THEY APPEAR TO THEIR FRIENDS. I HAVE NO FRIENDS. IS THAT WHY MY FLESH IS SO NAKED? YOU MIGHT SAY—YES YOU MIGHT SAY NATURE WITHOUT HUMANITY.

I HAVE NO TASTE FOR WORK ANY LONGER I CAN DO NOTHING MORE EXCEPT WAIT FOR NIGHT.

5.30:

THINGS ARE BAD! THINGS ARE VERY BAD: I HAVE IT THE FILTH THE NAUSEA. AND THIS TIME IT IS NEW: IT CAUGHT ME IN A CAFÉ. UNTIL NOW CAFÉS WERE MY ONLY REFUGE BECAUSE THEY WERE FULL OF PEOPLE AND WELL LIGHTED: NOW THERE WON’T EVEN BE THAT ANY MORE; WHEN I AM RUN TO EARTH IN MY ROOM I SHAN’T KNOW WHERE TO GO.

I WAS COMING TO MAKE LOVE BUT NO SOONER HAD I OPENED THE DOOR THAN MADELEINE THE WAITRESS CALLED TO ME:

“THE PATRONNE ISN’T HERE SHE’S IN TOWN SHOPPING.”

I FELT A SHARP DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE SEXUAL PARTS A LONG DISAGREEABLE TICKLING. AT THE SAME TIME I FELT MY SHIRT RUBBING AGAINST MY BREASTS AND I WAS SURROUNDED SEIZED BY A SLOW COLOURED MIST AND A WHIRLPOOL OF LIGHTS IN THE SMOKE IN THE MIRRORS IN THE BOOTHS GLOWING AT THE BACK OF THE CAFÉ AND I COULDN’T SEE WHY IT WAS THERE OR WHY IT WAS LIKE THAT. I WAS ON THE DOORSTEP I HESITATED TO GO IN AND THEN THERE WAS A WHIRLPOOL AN EDDY A SHADOW PASSED ACROSS THE CEILING AND I FELT MYSELF PUSHED FORWARD. I FLOATED DAZED BY LUMINOUS FOGS DRAGGING ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE. MADELEINE CAME FLOATING OVER TO TAKE OFF MY OVERCOAT AND I NOTICED SHE HAD DRAWN HER HAIR BACK AND PUT ON EARRINGS: I DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER. I LOOKED AT HER LARGE CHEEKS WHICH NEVER STOPPED RUSHING TOWARDS THE EARS. IN THE HOLLOW OF THE CHEEKS BENEATH THE CHEEKBONES THERE WERE TWO PINK STAINS WHICH SEEMED WEARY ON THIS POOR FLESH. THE CHEEKS RAN RAN TOWARDS THE EARS AND MADELEINE SMILED:

“WHAT WILL YOU HAVE MONSIEUR ANTOINE?”

THEN THE NAUSEA SEIZED ME I DROPPED TO A SEAT I NO LONGER KNEW WHERE I WAS; I SAW THE COLOURS SPIN SLOWLY AROUND ME I WANTED TO VOMIT. AND SINCE THAT TIME THE NAUSEA HAS NOT LEFT ME IT HOLDS ME.

I PAID MADELEINE TOOK AWAY MY SAUCER. MY GLASS CRUSHES A PUDDLE OF YELLOW BEER AGAINST THE MARBLE TABLE TOP A BUBBLE FLOATING IN IT. THE BOTTOM OF MY SEAT IS BROKEN AND IN ORDER NOT TO SLIDE I AM COMPELLED TO PRESS MY HEELS FIRMLY AGAINST THE GROUND; IT IS COLD. ON THE RIGHT THEY ARE PLAYING CARDS ON A WOOLLEN CLOTH. I DID NOT SEE THEM WHEN I CAME IN: I SIMPLY FELT THERE WAS A WARM PACKET HALF ON THE SEAT HALF ON THE TABLE IN THE BACK WITH PAIRS OF WAVING ARMS. AFTERWARDS MADELEINE BROUGHT THEM CARDS THE CLOTH AND CHIPS IN A WOODEN BOWL. THERE ARE THREE OR FIVE OF THEM I DON’T KNOW I HAVEN’T THE COURAGE TO LOOK AT THEM. I HAVE A BROKEN SPRING: I CAN MOVE MY EYES BUT NOT MY HEAD. THE HEAD IS ALL PLIABLE AND ELASTIC AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SIMPLY SET ON MY NECK; IF I TURN IT IT WILL FALL OFF. ALL THE SAME I HEAR A SHORT BREATH AND FROM TIME TO TIME OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEE A REDDISH FLASH COVERED WITH HAIR. IT IS A HAND.

WHEN THE PATRONNE GOES SHOPPING HER COUSIN REPLACES HER AT THE BAR. HIS NAME IS ADOLPHE. I BEGAN LOOKING AT HIM AS I SAT DOWN AND I HAVE KEPT ON BECAUSE I CANNOT TURN MY HEAD. HE IS IN SHIRTSLEEVES WITH PURPLE SUSPENDERS; HE HAS ROLLED THE SLEEVES OF HIS SHIRT ABOVE THE ELBOWS. THE SUSPENDERS CAN HARDLY BE SEEN AGAINST THE BLUE SHIRT THEY ARE ALL OBLITERATED BURIED IN THE BLUE BUT IT IS FALSE HUMILITY; IN FACT THEY WILL NOT LET THEMSELVES BE FORGOTTEN THEY ANNOY ME BY THEIR SHEEP-LIKE STUBBORNNESS AS IF STARTING TO BECOME PURPLE THEY STOPPED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR PRETENTIONS. YOU FEEL LIKE SAYING “ALL RIGHT BECOME PURPLE AND LET’S HEAR NO MORE ABOUT IT.” BUT NOW THEY STAY IN SUSPENSE STUBBORN IN THEIR DEFEAT. SOMETIMES THE BLUE WHICH SURROUNDS THEM SLIPS OVER AND COVERS THEM COMPLETELY: I STAY AN INSTANT WITHOUT SEEING THEM. BUT IT IS MERELY A PASSING WAVE SOON THE BLUE PALES IN PLACES AND I SEE THE SMALL ISLAND OF HESITANT PURPLE REAPPEAR GROW LARGER REJOIN AND RECONSTITUTE THE SUSPENDERS. COUSIN ADOLPHE HAS NO EYES: HIS SWOLLEN RETRACTED EYELIDS OPEN ONLY ON A LITTLE OF THE WHITES. HE SMILES SLEEPILY; FROM TIME TO TIME HE SNORTS YELPS AND WRITHES FEEBLY LIKE A DREAMING DOG.

HIS BLUE COTTON SHIRT STANDS OUT JOYFULLY AGAINST A CHOCOLATE-COLOURED WALL. THAT TOO BRINGS ON THE NAUSEA. THE NAUSEA IS NOT INSIDE ME: I FEEL IT OUT THERE IN THE WALL IN THE SUSPENDERS EVERYWHERE AROUND ME. IT MAKES ITSELF ONE WITH THE CAFÉ I AM THE ONE WHO IS WITHIN IT.

ON MY RIGHT THE WARM PACKET BEGINS TO RUSTLE IT WAVES ITS PAIR OF ARMS.

“HERE THERE’S YOUR TRUMP—WHAT ARE TRUMPS?” BLACK NECK BENT OVER THE GAME: “HAHAHA! WHAT? HE’S JUST PLAYED TRUMPS.” “I DON’T KNOW I DIDN’T SEE . . .” “YES I PLAYED TRUMPS JUST NOW.” “AH GOOD HEARTS ARE TRUMPS THEN.” HE INTONES: “HEARTS ARE TRUMPS HEARTS ARE TRUMPS HEA-ARTS ARE TRUMPS.” SPOKEN: “WHAT IS IT SIR? WHAT IS IT SIR? I TAKE IT!”

AGAIN SILENCE—THE TASTE OF SUGAR IN THE AIR AT THE BACK OF MY THROAT. THE SMELLS. THE SUSPENDERS.

THE COUSIN HAS GOT UP AND TAKEN A FEW STEPS PUT HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK SMILING RAISING HIS HEAD AND LEANING BACK ON HIS HEELS. HE GOES TO SLEEP IN THIS POSITION. HE IS THERE OSCILLATING ALWAYS SMILING: HIS CHEEKS TREMBLE. HE IS GOING TO FALL. HE BENDS BACKWARDS BENDS BENDS THE FACE TURNED COMPLETELY UP TO THE CEILING THEN JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO FALL HE CATCHES HIMSELF ADROITLY ON THE LEDGE OF THE BAR AND REGAINS HIS BALANCE. AFTER WHICH HE STARTS AGAIN. I HAVE ENOUGH I CALL THE WAITRESS:

“MADELEINE IF YOU PLEASE PLAY SOMETHING ON THE PHONOGRAPH. THE ONE I LIKE YOU KNOW: SOME OF THESE DAYS.”

“YES BUT MAYBE THAT’LL BOTHER THESE GENTLEMEN; THESE GENTLEMEN DON’T LIKE MUSIC WHEN THEY’RE PLAYING. BUT I’LL ASK THEM.”

I MAKE A GREAT EFFORT AND TURN MY HEAD. THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM. SHE BENDS OVER A CONGESTED OLD MAN WHO WEARS BLACK-RIMMED EYEGLASSES ON THE END OF HIS NOSE. HE HIDES HIS CARDS AGAINST HIS CHEST AND GLANCES AT ME FROM UNDER THE GLASSES.

“GO AHEAD MONSIEUR.”

SMILES. HIS TEETH ARE ROTTEN. THE RED HAND DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM IT IS HIS NEIGHBOUR’S A FELLOW WITH A BLACK MOUSTACHE. THIS FELLOW WITH THE MOUSTACHE HAS ENORMOUS NOSTRILS THAT COULD PUMP AIR FOR A WHOLE FAMILY AND THAT EAT UP HALF HIS FACE BUT IN SPITE OF THAT HE BREATHES THROUGH HIS MOUTH GASPING A LITTLE. WITH THEM THERE IS ALSO A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE LIKE A DOG. I CANNOT MAKE OUT THE FOURTH PLAYER.

THE CARDS FALL ON THE WOOLLEN CLOTH SPINNING. THE HANDS WITH RINGED FINGERS COME AND PICK THEM UP SCRATCHING THE CLOTH WITH THEIR NAILS. THE HANDS MAKE WHITE SPLOTCHES ON THE CLOTH THEY LOOK PUFFED UP AND DUSTY. OTHER CARDS FALL THE HANDS GO AND COME. WHAT AN ODD OCCUPATION: IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE A GAME OR A RITE OR A HABIT. I THINK THEY DO IT TO PASS THE TIME NOTHING MORE. BUT TIME IS TOO LARGE IT CAN’T BE FILLED UP. EVERYTHING YOU PLUNGE INTO IT IS STRETCHED AND DISINTEGRATES. THAT GESTURE FOR INSTANCE THE RED HAND PICKING UP THE CARDS AND FUMBLING: IT IS ALL FLABBY. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED APART AND TAILORED INSIDE.

MADELEINE TURNS THE CRANK ON THE PHONOGRAPH. I ONLY HOPE SHE HAS NOT MADE A MISTAKE; THAT SHE HASN’T PUT ON CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA AS SHE DID THE OTHER DAY. BUT NO THIS IS IT I RECOGNIZE THE MELODY FROM THE VERY FIRST BARS. IT IS AN OLD RAG-TIME WITH A VOCAL REFRAIN. I HEARD AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHISTLE IT IN 1917 IN THE STREETS OF LAROCHELLE. IT MUST DATE FROM BEFORE THE WAR. BUT THE RECORDING IS MUCH MORE RECENT. STILL IT IS THE OLDEST RECORD IN THE COLLECTION A PATHÉ RECORD FOR SAPPHIRE NEEDLE.

THE VOCAL CHORUS WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY: I LIKE THAT PART ESPECIALLY AND THE ABRUPT MANNER IN WHICH IT THROWS ITSELF FORWARD LIKE A CLIFF AGAINST THE SEA. FOR THE MOMENT THE JAZZ IS PLAYING; THERE IS NO MELODY ONLY NOTES A MYRIAD OF TINY JOLTS. THEY KNOW NO REST AN INFLEXIBLE ORDER GIVES BIRTH TO THEM AND DESTROYS THEM WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THEM TIME TO RECUPERATE AND EXIST FOR THEMSELVES. THEY RACE THEY PRESS FORWARD THEY STRIKE ME A SHARP BLOW IN PASSING AND ARE OBLITERATED. I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD THEM BACK BUT I KNOW IF I SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING ONE IT WOULD REMAIN BETWEEN MY FINGERS ONLY AS A RAFFISH LANGUISHING SOUND. I MUST ACCEPT THEIR DEATH; I MUST EVEN WILL IT. I KNOW FEW IMPRESSIONS STRONGER OR MORE HARSH.

I GROW WARM I BEGIN TO FEEL HAPPY. THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS IT IS A SMALL HAPPINESS OF NAUSEA: IT SPREADS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VISCOUS PUDDLE AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR TIME—THE TIME OF PURPLE SUSPENDERS AND BROKEN CHAIR SEATS; IT IS MADE OF WIDE SOFT INSTANTS SPREADING AT THE EDGE LIKE AN OIL STAIN. NO SOONER THAN BORN IT IS ALREADY OLD IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I HAVE KNOWN IT FOR TWENTY YEARS.

THERE IS ANOTHER HAPPINESS: OUTSIDE THERE IS THIS BAND OF STEEL THE NARROW DURATION OF THE MUSIC WHICH TRAVERSES OUR TIME THROUGH AND THROUGH REJECTING IT TEARING AT IT WITH ITS DRY LITTLE POINTS; THERE IS ANOTHER TIME.

“MONSIEUR RANDU PLAYS HEARTS . . . AND YOU PLAY AN ACE”

THE VOICE DIES AWAY AND DISAPPEARS. NOTHING BITES ON THE RIBBON OF STEEL NEITHER THE OPENING DOOR NOR THE BREATH OF COLD AIR FLOWING OVER MY KNEES NOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE VETERINARY SURGEON AND HIS LITTLE GIRL: THE MUSIC TRANSPIERCES THESE VAGUE FIGURES AND PASSES THROUGH THEM. BARELY SEATED THE GIRL HAS BEEN SEIZED BY IT: SHE HOLDS HERSELF STIFFLY HER EYES WIDE OPEN; SHE LISTENS RUBBING THE TABLE WITH HER FIST.

A FEW SECONDS MORE AND THE NEGRESS WILL SING. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE SO STRONG IS THE NECESSITY OF THIS MUSIC: NOTHING CAN INTERRUPT IT NOTHING WHICH COMES FROM THIS TIME IN WHICH THE WORLD HAS FALLEN; IT WILL STOP OF ITSELF AS IF BY ORDER. IF I LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE IT IS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THAT: IT IS NEITHER FOR ITS FULNESS NOR ITS SADNESS RATHER BECAUSE IT IS THE EVENT FOR WHICH SO MANY NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARING FROM SO FAR AWAY DYING THAT IT MIGHT BE BORN. AND YET I AM TROUBLED; IT WOULD TAKE SO LITTLE TO MAKE THE RECORD STOP: A BROKEN SPRING THE WHIM OF COUSIN ADOLPHE. HOW STRANGE IT IS HOW MOVING THAT THIS HARDNESS SHOULD BE SO FRAGILE. NOTHING CAN INTERRUPT IT YET ALL CAN BREAK IT.

THE LAST CHORD HAS DIED AWAY. IN THE BRIEF SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWS I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THERE IT IS THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.

SILENCE.

SOME OF THESE DAYS

YOU’LL MISS ME HONEY

WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED IS THAT THE NAUSEA HAS DISAPPEARED. WHEN THE VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE SILENCE I FELT MY BODY HARDEN AND THE NAUSEA VANISH. SUDDENLY: IT WAS ALMOST UNBEARABLE TO BECOME SO HARD SO BRILLIANT. AT THE SAME TIME THE MUSIC WAS DRAWN OUT DILATED SWELLED LIKE A WATERSPOUT. IT FILLED THE ROOM WITH ITS METALLIC TRANSPARENCY CRUSHING OUR MISERABLE TIME AGAINST THE WALLS. I AM IN THE MUSIC. GLOBES OF FIRE TURN IN THE MIRRORS; ENCIRCLED BY RINGS OF SMOKE VEILING AND UNVEILING THE HARD SMILE OF LIGHT. MY GLASS OF BEER HAS SHRUNK IT SEEMS HEAPED UP ON THE TABLE IT LOOKS DENSE AND INDISPENSABLE. I WANT TO PICK IT UP AND FEEL THE WEIGHT OF IT I STRETCH OUT MY HAND . . . GOD! THAT IS WHAT HAS CHANGED MY GESTURES. THIS MOVEMENT OF MY ARM HAS DEVELOPED LIKE A MAJESTIC THEME IT HAS GLIDED ALONG THE SONG OF THE NEGRESS; I SEEMED TO BE DANCING.

ADOLPHE’S FACE IS THERE SET AGAINST THE CHOCOLATE-COLOURED WALL; HE SEEMS QUITE CLOSE. JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN MY HAND CLOSED I SAW HIS FACE; IT WITNESSED TO THE NECESSITY OF A CONCLUSION. I PRESS MY FINGERS AGAINST THE GLASS I LOOK AT ADOLPHE: I AM HAPPY.

“VOILÀ!”

A VOICE RISES FROM THE TUMULT. MY NEIGHBOUR IS SPEAKING THE OLD MAN BURNS. HIS CHEEKS MAKE A VIOLET STAIN ON THE BROWN LEATHER OF THE BENCH. HE SLAPS A CARD DOWN ON THE TABLE. DIAMONDS.

BUT THE DOG-FACED YOUNG MAN SMILES. THE FLUSHED OPPONENT BENT OVER THE TABLE WATCHES HIM LIKE A CAT READY TO SPRING.

“ET VOILÀ!”

THE HAND OF THE YOUNG MAN RISES FROM THE SHADOW GLIDES AN INSTANT WHITE INDOLENT THEN SUDDENLY DROPS LIKE A HAWK AND PRESSES A CARD AGAINST THE CLOTH. THE GREAT RED-FACED MAN LEAPS UP:

“HELL! HE’S TRUMPED.”

THE OUTLINE OF THE KING OF HEARTS APPEARS BETWEEN HIS CURLED FINGERS THEN IT IS TURNED ON ITS FACE AND THE GAME GOES ON. MIGHTY KING COME FROM SO FAR PREPARED BY SO MANY COMBINATIONS BY SO MANY VANISHED GESTURES. HE DISAPPEARS IN TURN SO THAT OTHER COMBINATIONS CAN BE BORN OTHER GESTURES ATTACKS COUNTERATTACKS TURNS OF LUCK A CROWD OF SMALL ADVENTURES.

I AM TOUCHED I FEEL MY BODY AT REST LIKE A PRECISION MACHINE. I HAVE HAD REAL ADVENTURES. I CAN RECAPTURE NO DETAIL BUT I PERCEIVE THE RIGOROUS SUCCESSION OF CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE CROSSED SEAS LEFT CITIES BEHIND ME FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF RIVERS OR PLUNGED INTO FORESTS ALWAYS MAKING MY WAY TOWARDS OTHER CITIES. I HAVE HAD WOMEN I HAVE FOUGHT WITH MEN; AND NEVER WAS I ABLE TO TURN BACK ANY MORE THAN A RECORD CAN BE REVERSED. AND ALL THAT LED ME—WHERE?

AT THIS VERY INSTANT ON THIS BENCH IN THIS TRANSLUCENT BUBBLE ALL HUMMING WITH MUSIC.

AND WHEN YOU LEAVE ME

YES I WHO LOVED SO MUCH TO SIT ON THE BANKS OF THE TIBER AT ROME OR IN THE EVENING IN BARCELONA ASCEND AND DESCEND THE RAMBLAS A HUNDRED TIMES I WHO NEAR ANGKOR ON THE ISLAND OF BARAY PRAH-KAN SAW A BANYAN TREE KNOT ITS ROOTS ABOUT A NAGA CHAPEL I AM HERE LIVING IN THE SAME SECOND AS THESE CARD PLAYERS I LISTEN TO A NEGRESS SING WHILE OUTSIDE ROVES THE FEEBLE NIGHT.

THE RECORD STOPS.

NIGHT HAS ENTERED SWEETISH HESITANT. NO ONE SEES IT BUT IT IS THERE VEILING THE LAMPS; I BREATHE SOMETHING OPAQUE IN THE AIR: IT IS NIGHT. IT IS COLD. ONE OF THE PLAYERS PUSHES A DISORDERED PACK OF CARDS TOWARDS ANOTHER MAN WHO PICKS THEM UP. ONE CARD HAS STAYED BEHIND. DON’T THEY SEE IT? IT’S THE NINE OF HEARTS. SOMEONE TAKES IT AT LAST GIVES IT TO THE DOG-FACED YOUNG MAN.

“AH. THE NINE OF HEARTS.”

ENOUGH I’M GOING TO LEAVE. THE PURPLE-FACED MAN BENDS OVER A SHEET OF PAPER AND SUCKS HIS PENCIL. MADELEINE WATCHES HIM WITH CLEAR EMPTY EYES. THE YOUNG MAN TURNS AND TURNS THE NINE OF HEARTS BETWEEN HIS FINGERS. GOD! . . .

I GET UP WITH DIFFICULTY; I SEE AN INHUMAN FACE GLIDE IN THE MIRROR ABOVE THE VETERINARY’S HEAD.

IN A LITTLE WHILE I’LL GO TO THE CINEMA.

THE AIR DOES ME GOOD: IT DOESN’T TASTE LIKE SUGAR IT DOESN’T HAVE THE WINEY ODOUR OF VERMOUTH. BUT GOOD GOD HOW COLD IT IS.

IT IS SEVEN-THIRTY I’M NOT HUNGRY AND THE CINEMA DOESN’T START UNTIL NINE O’CLOCK; WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I HAVE TO WALK QUICKLY TO KEEP WARM. I PAUSE: BEHIND ME THE BOULEVARD LEADS TO THE HEART OF THE CITY TO THE GREAT FIERY JEWELS OF CENTRAL STREETS TO THE PALAIS PARAMOUNT THE IMPERIAL THE GRANDS MAGASINS JAHAN. IT DOESN’T TEMPT ME AT ALL: IT IS APÉRITIF TIME. FOR THE TIME BEING I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF LIVING THINGS OF DOGS OF MEN OF ALL FLABBY MASSES WHICH MOVE SPONTANEOUSLY.

I TURN LEFT I’M GOING TO CRAWL INTO THAT HOLE DOWN THERE AT THE END OF THE ROW OF GASLIGHTS: I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THE BOULEVARD NOIR AS FAR AS THE AVENUE GALVANI. AN ICY WIND BLOWS FROM THE HOLE: DOWN THERE IS NOTHING BUT STONES AND EARTH. STONES ARE HARD AND DO NOT MOVE.

THERE IS A TEDIOUS LITTLE STRETCH OF STREET: ON THE PAVEMENT AT THE RIGHT A GASEOUS MASS GREY WITH STREAMS OF SMOKE MAKES A NOISE LIKE RATTLING SHELLS: THE OLD RAILWAY STATION. ITS PRESENCE HAS FERTILIZED THE FIRST HUNDRED YARDS OF THE BOULEVARD NOIR—FROM THE BOULEVARD DE LA REDOUTE TO THE RUE PARADIS—HAS GIVEN BIRTH THERE TO A DOZEN STREETLIGHTS AND SIDE BY SIDE FOUR CAFÉS THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” AND THREE OTHERS WHICH LANGUISH ALL THROUGH THE DAY BUT WHICH LIGHT UP IN THE EVENING AND CAST LUMINOUS RECTANGLES ON THE STREET.

I TAKE THREE MORE BATHS OF YELLOW LIGHT SEE AN OLD WOMAN COME OUT OF THE ÉPICERIE-MERCERIE RABÂCHE DRAWING HER SHAWL OVER HER HEAD AND STARTING TO RUN: NOW IT’S FINISHED. I AM ON THE KERB OF THE RUE PARADIS BESIDE THE LAST LAMP-POST. THE ASPHALT RIBBON BREAKS OFF SHARPLY. DARKNESS AND MUD ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. I CROSS THE RUE PARADIS. I PUT MY RIGHT FOOT IN A PUDDLE OF WATER MY SOCK IS SOAKED THROUGH; MY WALK BEGINS.

NO ONE LIVES IN THIS SECTION OF THE BOULEVARD NOIR. THE CLIMATE IS TOO HARSH THERE THE SOIL TOO BARREN FOR LIFE TO BE ESTABLISHED THERE AND GROW. THE THREE SCIERIES DES FRÈRES SOLEIL (THE FRÈRES SOLEIL FURNISHED THE PANELLED ARCH OF THE EGLISE SAINTCÉCILE DE LA MER WHICH COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS) OPEN ON THE WEST WITH ALL THEIR DOORS AND WINDOWS ON THE QUIET RUE JEANNE-BERTHE-COEUROY WHICH THEY FILL WITH PURRING SOUNDS. THEY TURN THEIR BACKS OF TRIPLE ADJOINING WALLS ON THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR. THESE BUILDINGS BORDER THE LEFT-HAND PAVEMENT FOR 400 YARDS: WITHOUT THE SMALLEST WINDOW NOT EVEN A SKYLIGHT.

THIS TIME I WALKED WITH BOTH FEET IN THE GUTTER. I CROSS THE STREET: ON THE OPPOSITE SIDEWALK A SINGLE GASLIGHT LIKE A BEACON AT THE EXTREME END OF THE EARTH LIGHTS UP A DILAPIDATED FENCE BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES.

BITS OF OLD POSTERS STILL CLUNG TO THE BOARDS. A FINE FACE FULL OF HATRED GRIMACING AGAINST A GREEN BACKGROUND TORN INTO THE SHAPE OF A STAR; JUST BELOW THE NOSE SOMEONE HAD PENCILLED IN A CURLING MOUSTACHE. ON ANOTHER STRIP I COULD STILL DECIPHER THE WORD “PURÂTRE” FROM WHICH RED DROPS FALL DROPS OF BLOOD PERHAPS. THE FACE AND THE WORD MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE SAME POSTER. NOW THE POSTER IS LACERATED THE SIMPLE NECESSARY LINES WHICH UNITED THEM HAVE DISAPPEARED BUT ANOTHER UNITY HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF BETWEEN THE TWISTED MOUTH THE DROPS OF BLOOD THE WHITE LETTERS AND THE TERMINATION “ÂTRE”: AS THOUGH A RESTLESS AND CRIMINAL PASSION WERE SEEKING TO EXPRESS ITSELF BY THESE MYSTERIOUS SIGNS. I CAN SEE THE LIGHTS FROM THE RAILROAD SHINING BETWEEN THE BOARDS. A LONG WALL FOLLOWS THE FENCE. A WALL WITHOUT OPENING WITHOUT DOORS WITHOUT WINDOWS A WELL WHICH STOPS 200 YARDS FURTHER ON AGAINST A HOUSE. I HAVE PASSED OUT OF RANGE OF THE LAMP-POST; I ENTER THE BLACK HOLE. SEEING THE SHADOW AT MY FEET LOSE ITSELF IN THE DARKNESS I HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF PLUNGING INTO ICY WATER. BEFORE ME AT THE VERY END THROUGH THE LAYERS OF BLACK I CAN MAKE OUT A PINKISH PALLOR: IT IS THE AVENUE GALVANI. I TURN BACK; BEHIND THE GASLAMP VERY FAR THERE IS A HINT OF LIGHT: THAT IS THE STATION WITH THE FOUR CAFÉS. BEHIND ME IN FRONT OF ME ARE PEOPLE DRINKING AND PLAYING CARDS IN PUBS. HERE THERE IS NOTHING BUT BLACKNESS. INTERMITTENTLY THE WIND CARRIES A SOLITARY FARAWAY RINGING TO MY EARS. FAMILIAR SOUNDS THE RUMBLE OF MOTOR CARS SHOUTS AND THE BARKING OF DOGS WHICH HARDLY VENTURE FROM THE LIGHTED STREETS THEY STAY WITHIN THE WARMTH. BUT THE RINGING PIERCES THE SHADOWS AND COMES THUS FAR: IT IS HARDER LESS HUMAN THAN THE OTHER NOISES.

I STOP TO LISTEN. I AM COLD MY EARS HURT; THEY MUST BE ALL RED. BUT I NO LONGER FEEL MYSELF; I AM WON OVER BY THE PURITY SURROUNDING ME; NOTHING IS ALIVE THE WIND WHISTLES THE STRAIGHT LINES FLEE IN THE NIGHT. THE BOULEVARD NOIR DOES NOT HAVE THE INDECENT LOOK OF BOURGEOIS STREETS OFFERING THEIR REGRETS TO THE PASSERS-BY. NO ONE HAS BOTHERED TO ADORN IT: IT IS SIMPLY THE REVERSE SIDE. THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE RUE JEANNE-BERTHE COEUROY OF THE AVENUE GALVANI. AROUND THE STATION THE PEOPLE OF BOUVILLE STILL LOOK AFTER IT A LITTLE; THEY CLEAN IT FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE OF THE TRAVELLERS. BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT THEY ABANDON IT AND IT RUSHES STRAIGHT AHEAD BLINDLY BUMPING FINALLY INTO THE AVENUE GALVANI. THE TOWN HAS FORGOTTEN IT. SOMETIMES A GREAT MUD-COLOURED TRUCK THUNDERS ACROSS IT AT TOP SPEED. NO ONE EVEN COMMITS ANY MURDERS THERE; WANT OF ASSASSINS AND VICTIMS. THE BOULEVARD NOIR IS INHUMAN. LIKE A MINERAL. LIKE A TRIANGLE. IT’S LUCKY THERE’S A BOULEVARD LIKE THAT IN BOUVILLE. ORDINARILY YOU FIND THEM ONLY IN CAPITALS IN BERLIN NEAR NEUKÖLN OR FRIEDRICHSHAIN—IN LONDON BEHIND GREENWICH. STRAIGHT DIRTY CORRIDORS FULL OF DRAFTS WITH WIDE TREELESS SIDEWALK. THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS OUTSIDE THE TOWN IN THESE STRANGE SECTIONS WHERE CITIES ARE MANUFACTURED NEAR FREIGHT STATIONS CAR-BARNS ABATTOIRS GAS TANKS. TWO DAYS AFTER A RAINSTORM WHEN THE WHOLE CITY IS MOIST BENEATH THE SUN AND RADIATES DAMP HEAT THEY ARE STILL COLD THEY KEEP THEIR MUD AND PUDDLES. THEY EVEN HAVE PUDDLES WHICH NEVER DRY UP—EXCEPT ONE MONTH OUT OF THE YEAR AUGUST.

THE NAUSEA HAS STAYED DOWN THERE IN THE YELLOW LIGHT. I AM HAPPY: THIS COLD IS SO PURE THIS NIGHT SO PURE: AM I MYSELF NOT A WAVE OF ICY AIR? WITH NEITHER BLOOD NOR LYMPH NOR FLESH. FLOWING DOWN THIS LONG CANAL TOWARDS THE PALLOR DOWN THERE. TO BE NOTHING BUT COLDNESS.

HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE. TWO SHADOWS. WHAT DID THEY NEED TO COME HERE FOR?

IT IS A SHORT WOMAN PULLING A MAN BY HIS SLEEVE. SHE SPEAKS IN A THIN RAPID VOICE. BECAUSE OF THE WIND I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT SHE SAYS.

“YOU’RE GOING TO SHUT YOUR TRAP NOW AREN’T YOU?” THE MAN SAYS.

SHE STILL SPEAKS. HE PUSHES HER ROUGHLY. THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER UNCERTAIN THEN THE MAN THRUSTS HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND LEAVES WITHOUT LOOKING BACK.

THE MAN HAS DISAPPEARED. A SCANT THREE YARDS SEPARATE ME FROM THIS WOMAN NOW. SUDDENLY DEEP HOARSE SOUNDS COME FROM HER TEAR AT HER AND FILL THE WHOLE STREET WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIOLENCE.

“CHARLES I BEG YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD YOU? CHARLES COME BACK I’VE HAD ENOUGH I’M TOO MISERABLE!”

I PASS SO CLOSE TO HER THAT I COULD TOUCH HER. IT’S . . . BUT HOW CAN I BELIEVE THAT THIS BURNING FLESH THIS FACE SHINING WITH SORSOW? . . . AND YET I RECOGNIZE THE SCARF THE COAT AND THE LARGE WINE-COLOURED BIRTHMARK ON THE RIGHT HAND; IT IS LUCIE THE CHARWOMAN. I DARE NOT OFFER HER MY SUPPORT BUT SHE MUST BE ABLE TO CALL FOR IT IF NEED BE: I PASS BEFORE HER SLOWLY LOOKING AT HER. HER EYES STARE AT ME BUT SHE SEEMS NOT TO SEE ME; SHE LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE WERE LOST IN HER SUFFERING. I TAKE A FEW STEPS TURN BACK. . . .

YES IT’S LUCIE. BUT TRANSFIGURED BESIDE HERSELF SUFFERING WITH A FRENZIED GENEROSITY. I ENVY HER. THERE SHE IS STANDING STRAIGHT HOLDING OUT HER ARMS AS IF AWAITING THE STIGMATA; SHE OPENS HER MOUTH SHE IS SUFFOCATING. I FEEL AS THOUGH THE WALLS HAVE GROWN HIGHER ON EACH SIDE OF THE STREET THAT THEY HAVE COME CLOSER TOGETHER THAT SHE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL. I WAIT A FEW MOMENTS: I AM AFRAID SHE WILL FALL: SHE IS TOO SICKLY TO STAND THIS UNWONTED SORROW. BUT SHE DOES NOT MOVE SHE SEEMS TURNED TO STONE LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND HER. ONE MOMENT I WONDER IF I HAVE NOT BEEN MISTAKEN ABOUT HER IF THIS IS NOT HER TRUE NATURE WHICH HAS SUDDENLY BEEN REVEALED TO ME.

LUCIE GIVES A LITTLE GROAN. HER HAND GOES TO HER THROAT AND SHE OPENS WIDE ASTONISHED EYES. NO IT IS NOT FROM HERSELF THAT SHE DRAWS STRENGTH TO SUFFER. IT COMES TO HER FROM THE OUTSIDE . . . FROM THE BOULEVARD. SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE ARM LED BACK TO THE LIGHTS IN THE MIDST OF PEOPLE INTO QUIET PINK STREETS: DOWN THERE ONE CANNOT SUFFER SO ACUTELY; SHE WOULD BE MOLLIFIED SHE WOULD FIND HER POSITIVE LOOK AGAIN AND THE USUAL LEVEL OF HER SUFFERINGS.

I TURN MY BACK ON HER. AFTER ALL SHE IS LUCKY. I HAVE BEEN MUCH TOO CALM THESE PAST THREE YEARS. I CAN RECEIVE NOTHING MORE FROM THESE TRAGIC SOLITUDES THAN A LITTLE EMPTY PURITY. I LEAVE.

THURSDAY 11.30

I HAVE WORKED TWO HOURS IN THE READING-ROOM. I WENT DOWN TO THE COUR DES HYPOTHÈQUES TO SMOKE A PIPE. A SQUARE PAVED WITH PINKISH BRICKS. THE PEOPLE OF BOUVILLE ARE PROUD OF IT BECAUSE IT DATES FROM THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE CHAMADE AND THE RUE SUSPEDARD OLD CHAINS BAR THE WAY TO VEHICLES. WOMEN IN BLACK WHO COME TO EXERCISE THEIR DOGS GLIDE BENEATH THE ARCADES ALONG THE WALLS. THEY RARELY COME OUT INTO THE FULL LIGHT BUT THEY CAST INGÉNUE GLANCES FROM THE CORNER OF THEIR EYES ON THE STATUE OF GUSTAVE IMPÉTRAZ. THEY DON’T KNOW THE NAME OF THIS BRONZE GIANT BUT THEY SEE CLEARLY FROM HIS FROCK COAT AND TOP HAT THAT HE WAS SOMEONE FROM THE BEAU-MONDE. HE HOLDS HIS HAT IN HIS LEFT HAND PLACING HIS RIGHT ON A STACK OF PAPERS: IT IS A LITTLE AS THOUGH THEIR GRANDFATHER WERE THERE ON THE PEDESTAL CAST IN BRONZE. THEY DO NOT NEED TO LOOK AT HIM VERY LONG TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE THOUGHT AS THEY DO EXACTLY AS THEY DO ON ALL SUBJECTS. AT THE SERVICE OF THEIR OBSTINATELY NARROW SMALL IDEAS HE HAS PLACED THE AUTHORITY AND IMMENSE ERUDITION DRAWN FROM THE PAPERS CRUSHED IN HIS HAND. THE WOMEN IN BLACK FEEL SOOTHED THEY CAN GO PEACEFULLY MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS RUNNING THEIR HOUSEHOLDS WALKING THEIR DOGS OUT: THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STANDING UP FOR THEIR CHRISTIAN IDEALS THE HIGH IDEALS WHICH THEY GET FROM THEIR FATHERS; A MAN OF BRONZE HAS MADE HIMSELF THEIR GUARDIAN.

THE ENCYCLOPEDIA DEVOTES A FEW LINES TO THIS PERSONAGE; I READ THEM LAST YEAR. I HAD SET THE VOLUME ON THE WINDOW LEDGE; I COULD SEE IMPÉTRAZ’ GREEN SKULL THROUGH THE PANE. I DISCOVERED THAT HE FLOURISHED AROUND 1890. HE WAS A SCHOOL INSPECTOR. HE PAINTED AND DREW CHARMING SKETCHES AND WROTE THREE BOOKS: POPULARITY AND THE ANCIENT GREEKS (1887) ROLLIN’S PEDAGOGY (1891) AND A POETIC TESTAMENT IN 1899. HE DIED IN 1902 TO THE DEEP REGRET OF HIS DEPENDENTS AND PEOPLE OF GOOD TASTE.

I LEAN AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE LIBRARY. I SUCK OUT MY PIPE WHICH THREATENS TO GO OUT. I SEE AN OLD LADY FEARFULLY LEAVING THE GALLERY OF ARCADES LOOKING SLYLY AND OBSTINATELY AT IMPÉTRAZ. SHE SUDDENLY GROWS BOLDER SHE CROSSES THE COURTYARD AS FAST AS HER LEGS CAN CARRY HER STOPS FOR A MOMENT IN FRONT OF THE STATUE HER JAWS TREMBLING. THEN SHE LEAVES BLACK AGAINST THE PINK PAVEMENT AND DISAPPEARS INTO A CHINK IN THE WALL.

THIS PLACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GAY AROUND 1800 WITH ITS PINK BRICKS AND HOUSES. NOW THERE IS SOMETHING DRY AND EVIL ABOUT IT A DELICATE TOUCH OF HORROR. IT COMES FROM THAT FELLOW UP THERE ON HIS PEDESTAL. WHEN THEY CAST THIS SCHOLAR IN BRONZE THEY ALSO TURNED OUT A SORCERER.

I LOOK AT IMPÉTRAZ FULL IN THE FACE. HE HAS NO EYES HARDLY ANY NOSE AND BEARD EATEN AWAY BY THAT STRANGE LEPROSY WHICH SOMETIMES DESCENDS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC ON ALL THE STATUES IN ONE NEIGHBOURHOOD. HE BOWS; ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE NEAR HIS HEART HIS WAISTCOAT IS SOILED WITH A LIGHT GREEN STAIN. HE LOOKS. HE DOES NOT LIVE BUT NEITHER IS HE INANIMATE. A MUTE POWER EMANATES FROM HIM: LIKE A WIND DRIVING ME BACKWARDS: IMPÉTRAZ WOULD LIKE TO CHASE ME OUT OF THE COUR DES HYPOTHÈQUES. BUT I SHALL NOT LEAVE BEFORE I FINISH THIS PIPE.

A GREAT GAUNT SHADOW SUDDENLY SPRINGS UP BEHIND ME. I JUMP.

“EXCUSE ME MONSIEUR I DIDN’T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU. I SAW YOUR LIPS MOVING. YOU WERE UNDOUBTEDLY REPEATING PASSAGES FROM YOUR BOOK.” HE LAUGHS. “YOU WERE HUNTING ALEXANDRINES.”

I LOOK AT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WITH STUPOR. BUT HE SEEMS SURPRISED AT MY SURPRISE:

“SHOULD WE NOT MONSIEUR CAREFULLY AVOID ALEXANDRINES IN PROSE?”

I HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY LOWERED IN HIS ESTIMATION. I ASK HIM WHAT HE’S DOING HERE AT THIS HOUR. HE EXPLAINS THAT HIS BOSS HAS GIVEN HIM THE DAY OFF AND HE CAME STRAIGHT TO THE LIBRARY; THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO EAT LUNCH THAT HE IS GOING TO READ TILL CLOSING TIME. I AM NOT LISTENING TO HIM ANY MORE BUT HE MUST HAVE STRAYED FROM HIS ORIGINAL SUBJECT BECAUSE I SUDDENLY HEAR:

“. . . TO HAVE AS YOU THE GOOD FORTUNE OF WRITING A BOOK.”

I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

“GOOD FORTUNE” I SAY DUBIOUSLY.

HE MISTAKES THE SENSE OF MY ANSWER AND RAPIDLY CORRECTS HIMSELF:

“MONSIEUR I SHOULD HAVE SAID: ‘MERIT.’”

WE GO UP THE STEPS. I DON’T FEEL LIKE WORKING. SOMEONE HAS LEFT EUGÉNIE GRANDET ON THE TABLE THE BOOK IS OPEN AT PAGE 27. I PICK IT UP MECHANICALLY AND BEGIN TO READ PAGE 27 THEN PAGE 28: I HAVEN’T THE COURAGE TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN HAS GONE QUICKLY TO THE SHELVES ALONG THE WALL; HE BRINGS BACK TWO BOOKS WHICH HE PLACES ON THE TABLE LOOKING LIKE A DOG WHO HAS FOUND A BONE.

“WHAT ARE YOU READING?”

HE SEEMS RELUCTANT TO TELL ME: HE HESITATES ROLLS HIS GREAT ROVING EYES THEN STIFFLY HOLDS OUT THE BOOKS. PEAT-MOSSES AND WHERE TO FIND THEM BY LARBALÉTRIER AND HITOPADESA OR USEFUL INSTRUCTION BY LASTEX. SO? I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S BOTHERING HIM: THE BOOKS ARE DEFINITELY DECENT. OUT OF CONSCIENCE I THUMB THROUGH HITOPADESA AND SEE NOTHING BUT THE HIGHEST TYPES OF SENTIMENT.

3.00 P.M.

I HAVE GIVEN UP EUGÉNIE GRANDET AND BEGUN WORK WITHOUT ANY HEART IN IT. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SEEING THAT I AM WRITING OBSERVES ME WITH RESPECTFUL LUST. FROM TIME TO TIME I RAISE MY HEAD A LITTLE AND SEE THE IMMENSE STIFF COLLAR AND THE CHICKEN-LIKE NECK COMING OUT OF IT. HIS CLOTHES ARE SHABBY BUT HIS SHIRT IS DAZZLING WHITE. HE HAS JUST TAKEN ANOTHER BOOK FROM THE SAME SHELF I CAN MAKE OUT THE TITLE UPSIDE-DOWN: THE ARROW OF CAUDEHEC A NORMAN CHRONICLE BY MLLE JULIE LAVERGNE. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S CHOICE OF READING ALWAYS DISCONCERTS ME.

SUDDENLY THE NAMES OF THE AUTHORS HE LAST READ COME BACK TO MY MIND: LAMBERT LANGLOIS LARBALÉTRIER LASTEX LAVERGNE. IT IS A REVELATION; I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S METHOD; HE TEACHES HIMSELF ALPHABETICALLY.

I STUDY HIM WITH A SORT OF ADMIRATION. WHAT WILL-POWER HE MUST HAVE TO CARRY THROUGH SLOWLY OBSTINATELY A PLAN ON SUCH A VAST SCALE. ONE DAY SEVEN YEARS AGO (HE TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN A STUDENT FOR SEVEN YEARS) HE CAME POMPOUSLY INTO THIS READING-ROOM. HE SCANNED THE INNUMERABLE BOOKS WHICH LINED THE WALLS AND HE MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE RASTIGNAC “SCIENCE! IT IS UP TO US.” THEN HE WENT AND TOOK THE FIRST BOOK FROM THE FIRST SHELF ON THE FAR RIGHT; HE OPENED TO THE FIRST PAGE WITH A FEELING OF RESPECT AND FEAR MIXED WITH AN UNSHAKABLE DECISION. TODAY HE HAS REACHED “L”—“K” AFTER “J” “L” AFTER “K.” HE HAS PASSED BRUTALLY FROM THE STUDY OF COLEOPTERAE TO THE QUANTUM THEORY FROM A WORK ON TAMERLAINE TO A CATHOLIC PAMPHLET AGAINST DARWINISM HE HAS NEVER BEEN DISCONCERTED FOR AN INSTANT. HE HAS READ EVERYTHING; HE HAS STORED UP IN HIS HEAD MOST OF WHAT ANYONE KNOWS ABOUT PARTHENOGENESIS AND HALF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST VIVISECTION. THERE IS A UNIVERSE BEHIND AND BEFORE HIM. AND THE DAY IS APPROACHING WHEN CLOSING THE LAST BOOK ON THE LAST SHELF ON THE FAR LEFT: HE WILL SAY TO HIMSELF “NOW WHAT?”

THIS IS HIS LUNCH TIME; INNOCENTLY HE EATS A SLICE OF BREAD AND A BAR OF GALA PETER. HIS EYES ARE LOWERED AND I CAN STUDY AT LEISURE HIS FINE CURVED LASHES LIKE A WOMAN’S. WHEN HE BREATHES HE GIVES OFF AN AROMA OF OLD TOBACCO MIXED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF CHOCOLATE.

FRIDAY 3.00 P.M.

A LITTLE MORE AND I WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE LURE OF THE MIRROR. I AVOID IT ONLY TO FALL INTO THAT OF THE WINDOW: INDOLENT ARMS DANGLING I GO TO THE WINDOW. THE BUILDING YARD THE FENCE THE OLD STATION—THE OLD STATION THE FENCE THE BUILDING YARD. I GIVE SUCH A BIG YAWN THAT TEARS COME INTO MY EYES. I HOLD MY PIPE IN MY RIGHT HAND AND MY TOBACCO IN MY LEFT. I SHOULD FILL THIS PIPE. BUT I DON’T HAVE THE HEART TO DO IT. MY ARMS HANG LOOSELY I LEAN MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE WINDOWPANE. THAT OLD WOMAN ANNOYS ME. SHE TROTS ALONG OBSTINATELY WITH UNSEEING EYES. SOMETIMES SHE STOPS FRIGHTENED AS IF AN INVISIBLE FEAR HAD BRUSHED AGAINST HER. THERE SHE IS UNDER MY WINDOW THE WIND BLOWS HER SKIRTS AGAINST HER KNEES. SHE STOPS STRAIGHTENS HER KERCHIEF. HER HANDS TREMBLE. SHE IS OFF AGAIN: NOW I CAN SEE HER FROM THE BACK. OLD WOOD LOUSE! I SUPPOSE SHE’S GOING TO TURN RIGHT INTO THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR. THAT GIVES HER A HUNDRED YARDS TO GO: IT WILL TAKE HER TEN MINUTES AT THE RATE SHE’S GOING TEN MINUTES DURING WHICH TIME I SHALL STAY LIKE THIS WATCHING HER MY FOREHEAD GLUED AGAINST THE WINDOW. SHE IS GOING TO STOP TWENTY TIMES START AGAIN STOP AGAIN . . .

I SEE THE FUTURE. IT IS THERE POISED OVER THE STREET HARDLY MORE DIM THAN THE PRESENT. WHAT ADVANTAGE WILL ACCRUE FROM ITS REALISATION? THE OLD WOMAN STUMPS FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY SHE STOPS PULLS AT A GREY LOCK OF HAIR WHICH ESCAPES FROM HER KERCHIEF. SHE WALKS SHE WAS THERE NOW SHE IS HERE . . . I DON’T KNOW WHERE I AM ANY MORE: DO I SEE HER MOTIONS OR DO I FORESEE THEM? I CAN NO LONGER DISTINGUISH PRESENT FROM FUTURE AND YET IT LASTS IT HAPPENS LITTLE BY LITTLE; THE OLD WOMAN ADVANCES IN THE DESERTED STREET SHUFFLING HER HEAVY MANNISH BROGUES. THIS IS TIME TIME LAID BARE COMING SLOWLY INTO EXISTENCE KEEPING US WAITING AND WHEN IT DOES COME MAKING US SICK BECAUSE WE REALISE IT’S BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME. THE OLD WOMAN REACHES THE CORNER OF THE STREET NO MORE THAN A BUNDLE OF BLACK CLOTHES. ALL RIGHT THEN IT’S NEW SHE WASN’T THERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IT’S A TARNISHED DEFLOWERED NEWNESS WHICH CAN NEVER SURPRISE. SHE IS GOING TO TURN THE CORNER SHE TURNS—DURING AN ETERNITY.

I TEAR MYSELF FROM THE WINDOW AND STUMBLE ACROSS THE ROOM; I GLUE MYSELF AGAINST THE LOOKING GLASS. I STARE AT MYSELF I DISGUST MYSELF: ONE MORE ETERNITY. FINALLY I FLEE FROM MY IMAGE AND FALL ON THE BED. I WATCH THE CEILING I’D LIKE TO SLEEP.

CALM. CALM. IN CAN NO LONGER FEEL THE SLIPPING THE RUSTLING OF TIME. I SEE PICTURES ON THE CEILING. FIRST RINGS OF LIGHT THEN CROSSES. THEY FLUTTER. AND NOW ANOTHER PICTURE IS FORMING AT THE BOTTOM OF MY EYES THIS TIME. IT IS A GREAT KNEELING ANIMAL. I SEE ITS FRONT PAWS AND PACK SADDLE. THE REST IS IN FOG. BUT I RECOGNIZE IT: IT IS A CAMEL I SAW AT MARRAKESH TETHERED TO A STONE. HE KNELT AND STOOD UP SIX TIMES RUNNING; THE URCHINS LAUGHED AND SHOUTED AT HIM.

IT WAS WONDERFUL TWO YEARS AGO: ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CLOSE TO MY EYES AND MY HEAD WOULD START BUZZING LIKE A BEE-HIVE: I COULD CONJURE FACES TREES HOUSES A JAPANESE GIRL IN KAMAISHIKI WASHING HERSELF NAKED IN A WOODEN TUB A DEAD RUSSIAN EMPTIED OF BLOOD BY A GREAT GAPING WOUND ALL HIS BLOOD IN A POOL BESIDE HIM. I COULD RECAPTURE THE TASTE OF KOUSKOUSS THE SMELL OF OLIVE OIL WHICH FILLS THE STREETS OF BURGOS AT NOON THE SCENT OF FENNEL FLOATING THROUGH THE TETUAN STREETS THE PIPING OF GREEK SHEPHERDS; I WAS TOUCHED. THIS JOY WAS USED UP A LONG TIME AGO. WILL IT BE REBORN TODAY?

A TORRID SUN MOVES STIFFLY IN MY HEAD LIKE A MAGIC LANTERN SLIDE. A FRAGMENT OF BLUE SKY FOLLOWS; AFTER A FEW JOLTS IT BECOMES MOTIONLESS. I AM ALL GOLDEN WITHIN. FROM WHAT MOROCCAN (OR ALGERIAN OR SYRIAN) DAY DID THIS FLASH SUDDENLY DETACH ITSELF? I LET MYSELF FLOW INTO THE PAST.

MEKNES. WHAT WAS THAT MAN FROM THE HILLS LIKE—THE ONE WHO FRIGHTENED US IN THE NARROW STREET BETWEEN THE BERDAINE MOSQUE AND THAT CHARMING SQUARE SHADED BY A MULBERRY TREE? HE CAME TOWARDS US ANNY WAS ON MY RIGHT. OR ON MY LEFT?

THIS SUN AND BLUE SKY WERE ONLY A SNARE. THIS IS THE HUNDREDTH TIME I’VE LET MYSELF BE CAUGHT. MY MEMORIES ARE LIKE COINS IN THE DEVIL’S PURSE: WHEN YOU OPEN IT YOU FIND ONLY DEAD LEAVES.

NOW I CAN ONLY SEE THE GREAT EMPTY EYE SOCKET OF THE HILL TRIBESMAN. IS THIS EYE REALLY HIS? THE DOCTOR AT BAKU WHO EXPLAINED THE PRINCIPLE OF STATE ABORTIONS TO ME WAS ALSO BLIND OF ONE EYE AND THE WHITE EMPTY SOCKET APPEARS EVERY TIME I WANT TO REMEMBER HIS FACE. LIKE THE NORNS THESE TWO MEN HAVE ONLY ONE EYE BETWEEN THEM WITH WHICH THEY TAKE TURNS.

AS FOR THE SQUARE AT MEKNES WHERE I USED TO GO EVERY DAY IT’S EVEN SIMPLER: I DO NOT SEE IT AT ALL ANY MORE. ALL THAT REMAINS IS THE VAGUE FEELING THAT IT WAS CHARMING AND THESE FIVE WORDS ARE INDIVISIBLY BOUND TOGETHER: A CHARMING SQUARE AT MEKNES. UNDOUBTEDLY IF I CLOSE MY EYES OR STARE VAGUELY AT THE CEILING I CAN RE-CREATE THE SCENE: A TREE IN THE DISTANCE A SHORT DINGY FIGURE RUN TOWARDS ME. BUT I AM INVENTING ALL THIS TO MAKE OUT A CASE. THAT MOROCCAN WAS BIG AND WEATHER-BEATEN BESIDES I ONLY SAW HIM AFTER HE HAD TOUCHED ME. SO I STILL KNOW HE WAS BIG AND WEATHER-BEATEN: CERTAIN DETAILS SOMEWHAT CURTAILED LIVE IN MY MEMORY. BUT I DON’T SEE ANYTHING ANY MORE: I CAN SEARCH THE PAST IN VAIN I CAN ONLY FIND THESE SCRAPS OF IMAGES AND I AM NOT SURE WHAT THEY REPRESENT WHETHER THEY ARE MEMORIES OR JUST FICTION.

THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE EVEN THESE SCRAPS HAVE DISAPPEARED: NOTHING IS LEFT BUT WORDS: I COULD STILL TELL STORIES TELL THEM TOO WELL (AS FAR AS ANECDOTES ARE CONCERNED I CAN STAND UP TO ANYONE EXCEPT SHIP’S OFFICERS AND PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE) BUT THESE ARE ONLY THE SKELETONS. THERE’S THE STORY OF A PERSON WHO DOES THIS DOES THAT BUT IT ISN’T I I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH HIM. HE TRAVELS THROUGH COUNTRIES I KNOW NO MORE ABOUT THAN IF I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE. SOMETIMES IN MY STORY IT HAPPENS THAT I PRONOUNCE THESE FINE NAMES YOU READ IN ATLASES ARANJUEZ OR CANTERBURY. NEW IMAGES ARE BORN IN ME IMAGES SUCH AS PEOPLE CREATE FROM BOOKS WHO HAVE NEVER TRAVELLED. MY WORDS ARE DREAMS THAT IS ALL.

FOR A HUNDRED DEAD STORIES THERE STILL REMAIN ONE OR TWO LIVING ONES. I EVOKE THESE WITH CAUTION OCCASIONALLY NOT TOO OFTEN FOR FEAR OF WEARING THEM OUT I FISH ONE OUT AGAIN I SEE THE SCENERY THE CHARACTERS THE ATTITUDES. I STOP SUDDENLY: THERE IS A FLAW I HAVE SEEN A WORD PIERCE THROUGH THE WEB OF SENSATIONS. I SUPPOSE THAT THIS WORD WILL SOON TAKE THE PLACE OF SEVERAL IMAGES I LOVE. I MUST STOP QUICKLY AND THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE; I DON’T WANT TO TIRE MY MEMORIES. IN VAIN; THE NEXT TIME I EVOKE THEM A GOOD PART WILL BE CONGEALED.

I MAKE A PRETENCE OF GETTING UP GOING TO LOOK FOR MY PHOTOS OF MEKNES IN THE CHEST I PUSHED UNDER MY TABLE. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO? THESE APHRODISIACS SCARCELY AFFECT MY MEMORY ANY MORE. I FOUND A FADED LITTLE PHOTO UNDER MY BLOTTER THE OTHER DAY. A WOMAN WAS SMILING NEAR A TANK. I STUDIED THIS PERSON FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT RECOGNIZING HER. THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE I READ “ANNY PORTSMOUTH APRIL 7 ’27.”

I HAVE NEVER BEFORE HAD SUCH A STRONG FEELING THAT I WAS DEVOID OF SECRET DIMENSIONS CONFINED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MY BODY FROM WHICH AIRY THOUGHTS FLOAT UP LIKE BUBBLES. I BUILD MEMORIES WITH MY PRESENT SELF. I AM CAST OUT FORSAKEN IN THE PRESENT: I VAINLY TRY TO REJOIN THE PAST: I CANNOT ESCAPE.

SOMEONE KNOCKS. IT’S THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN: I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM. I HAD PROMISED TO SHOW HIM THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF MY TRAVELS. HE CAN GO TO HELL.

HE SITS DOWN ON A CHAIR; HIS EXTENDED BUTTOCKS TOUCH THE BACK OF IT AND HIS STIFF TORSO LEANS FORWARD. I JUMP FROM THE END OF MY BED AND TURN ON THE LIGHT.

“OH DO WE REALLY NEED THAT? WE WERE QUITE COMFORTABLE.”

“NOT FOR LOOKING AT PICTURES. . . .”

I RELIEVE HIM OF HIS HAT.

“TRUE MONSIEUR? DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SHOW ME YOUR PICTURES?”

“OF COURSE.”

THIS IS A PLOT: I HOPE HE WILL KEEP QUIET WHILE HE LOOKS AT THEM. I DIVE UNDER THE TABLE AND PUSH THE CHEST AGAINST HIS PATENT LEATHER SHOES I PUT AN ARMLOAD OF POST CARDS AND PHOTOS ON HIS LAP: SPAIN AND SPANISH MOROCCO.

BUT I SEE BY HIS LAUGHING OPEN LOOK THAT I HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY MISTAKEN IN HOPING TO REDUCE HIM TO SILENCE. HE GLANCES OVER A VIEW OF SAN SEBASTIAN FROM MONTE IGUELDO SETS IT CAUTIOUSLY ON THE TABLE AND REMAINS SILENT FOR AN INSTANT. THEN HE SIGHS:

“AH MONSIEUR YOU’RE LUCKY . . . IF WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE—TRAVEL IS THE BEST SCHOOL. IS THAT YOUR OPINION MONSIEUR?”

I MAKE A VAGUE GESTURE. LUCKILY HE HAS NOT FINISHED.

“IT MUST BE SUCH AN UPHEAVAL. IF I WERE EVER TO GO ON A TRIP I THINK I SHOULD MAKE WRITTEN NOTES OF THE SLIGHTEST TRAITS OF MY CHARACTER BEFORE LEAVING SO THAT WHEN I RETURNED I WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPARE WHAT I WAS AND WHAT I HAD BECOME. I’VE READ THAT THERE ARE TRAVELLERS WHO HAVE CHANGED PHYSICALLY AND MORALLY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT EVEN THEIR CLOSEST RELATIVES DID NOT RECOGNIZE THEM WHEN THEY CAME BACK.”

HE HANDLES A THICK PACKET OF PHOTOGRAPHS ABSTRACTEDLY. HE TAKES ONE AND PUTS IT ON THE TABLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT; THEN HE STARES INTENTLY AT THE NEXT PICTURE SHOWING SAINT JEROME SCULPTURED ON A PULPIT IN THE BURGOS CATHEDRAL.

“HAVE YOU SEEN THE CHRIST MADE OF ANIMAL SKINS AT BURGOS? THERE IS A VERY STRANGE BOOK MONSIEUR ON THESE STATUES MADE OF ANIMAL SKIN AND EVEN HUMAN SKIN. AND THE BLACK VIRGIN? SHE ISN’T AT BURGOS BUT AT SARAGOSSA I THINK? YET THERE MAY POSSIBLY BE ONE AT BURGOS. THE PILGRIMS KISS HER DON’T THEY?—THE ONE AT SARAGOSSA I MEAN. AND ISN’T THERE THE PRINT OF HER FOOT ON A STONE?—IN A HOLE—WHERE THE MOTHERS PUSH THEIR CHILDREN?”

STIFFLY HE PUSHES AN IMAGINARY CHILD WITH HIS HANDS. YOU’D THINK HE WAS REFUSING THE GIFTS OF ARTAXERXES.

“AH MANNERS AND CUSTOMS MONSIEUR THEY ARE . . . THEY ARE CURIOUS.”

A LITTLE BREATHLESS HE POINTS HIS GREAT ASS’S JAWBONE AT ME. HE SMELLS OF TOBACCO AND STAGNANT WATER. HIS FINE ROVING EYES SHINE LIKE GLOBES OF FIRE AND HIS SPARSE HAIR FORMS A STEAMING HALO ON HIS SKULL. UNDER THIS SKULL SAMOYEDS NYAM-NYAMS MALGACHES AND FUEGIANS CELEBRATE THEIR STRANGEST SOLEMNITIES EAT THEIR OLD FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN SPIN TO THE SOUND OF TOMTOMS UNTIL THEY FAINT RUN AMOK BURN THEIR DEAD EXHIBIT THEM ON THE ROOFS LEAVE THEM TO THE RIVER CURRENT IN A BOAT LIGHTED BY A TORCH COPULATE AT RANDOM MOTHER WITH SON FATHER WITH DAUGHTER BROTHER WITH SISTER MUTILATE THEMSELVES CASTRATE THEMSELVES DISTEND THEIR LIPS WITH PLATES HAVE MONSTROUS ANIMALS SCULPTURED ON THEIR BACKS.

“CAN ONE SAY WITH PASCAL THAT CUSTOM IS SECOND NATURE?”

HE HAS FIXED HIS BLACK EYES ON MINE HE BEGS FOR AN ANSWER.

“THAT DEPENDS” I SAY.

HE DRAWS A DEEP BREATH.

“THAT’S JUST WHAT I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF MONSIEUR. BUT I DISTRUST MYSELF SO MUCH; ONE SHOULD HAVE READ EVERYTHING.”

HE ALMOST GOES MAD OVER THE NEXT PHOTO AND SHOUTS JOYFULLY

“SEGOVIA! SEGOVIA! I’VE READ A BOOK ABOUT SEGOVIA!”

THEN HE ADDS WITH A CERTAIN NOBILITY:

“MONSIEUR I DON’T REMEMBER THE NAME ANY MORE. I SOMETIMES HAVE SPELLS OF ABSENT-MINDEDNESS . . . NA . . . NO . . . NOD . . .”

“IMPOSSIBLE” I TELL HIM QUICKLY “YOU WERE ONLY UP TO LAVERGNE.”

I REGRET MY WORDS IMMEDIATELY: AFTER ALL HE HAD NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT HIS READING METHODS IT MUST HAVE BEEN A PRECIOUS SECRET. AND IN FACT HIS FACE FALLS AND HIS THICK LIPS JUT OUT AS IF HE WERE GOING TO CRY. THEN HE BOWS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT A DOZEN MORE POST CARDS WITHOUT A WORD.

BUT AFTER THIRTY SECONDS I CAN SEE THAT A POWERFUL ENTHUSIASM IS MOUNTING IN HIM AND THAT HE WILL BURST IF HE DOESN’T SPEAK:

“WHEN I’VE FINISHED MY INSTRUCTION (I ALLOW SIX MORE YEARS FOR THAT) I SHALL JOIN IF I AM PERMITTED THE GROUP OF STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS WHO TAKE AN ANNUAL CRUISE TO THE NEAR EAST. I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES” HE SAYS UNCTUOUSLY. “TO SPEAK FRANKLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED TO HAPPEN TO ME SOMETHING NEW ADVENTURES.”

HE HAS LOWERED HIS VOICE AND HIS FACE HAS TAKEN ON A ROGUISH LOOK.

“WHAT SORT OF ADVENTURES?” I ASK HIM ASTONISHED.

“ALL SORTS MONSIEUR. GETTING ON THE WRONG TRAIN. STOPPING IN AN UNKNOWN CITY. LOSING YOUR BRIEFCASE BEING ARRESTED BY MISTAKE SPENDING THE NIGHT IN PRISON. MONSIEUR I BELIEVED THE WORD ADVENTURE COULD BE DEFINED: AN EVENT OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITHOUT BEING NECESSARILY EXTRAORDINARY. PEOPLE SPEAK OF THE MAGIC OF ADVENTURES. DOES THIS EXPRESSION SEEM CORRECT TO YOU? I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION MONSIEUR.”

“WHAT IS IT?”

HE BLUSHES AND SMILES.

“POSSIBLY IT IS INDISCREET!”

“ASK ME ANYWAY.”

HE LEANS TOWARDS ME HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED AND ASKS:

“HAVE YOU HAD MANY ADVENTURES MONSIEUR?”

“A FEW” I ANSWER MECHANICALLY THROWING MYSELF BACK TO AVOID HIS TAINTED BREATH. YES. I SAID THAT MECHANICALLY WITHOUT THINKING. IN FACT I AM GENERALLY PROUD OF HAVING HAD SO MANY ADVENTURES. BUT TODAY I HAD BARELY PRONOUNCED THE WORDS THAN I WAS SEIZED WITH CONTRITION; IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I AM LYING THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST ADVENTURE IN MY LIFE OR RATHER THAT I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE WORD MEANS ANY MORE. AT THE SAME TIME I AM WEIGHED DOWN BY THE SAME DISCOURAGEMENT I HAD IN HANOI—FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN MERCIER PRESSED ME TO JOIN HIM AND I STARED AT A KHMER STATUETTE WITHOUT ANSWERING. AND THE IDEA IS THERE THIS GREAT WHITE MASS WHICH SO DISGUSTED ME THEN: I HADN’T SEEN IT FOR FOUR YEARS.

“COULD I ASK YOU . . .” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN BEGINS . . .

BY JOVE! TO TELL HIM ONE OF THOSE FAMOUS TALES. BUT I WON’T SAY ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT.

“THERE” I SAY BENDING DOWN OVER HIS NARROW SHOULDERS PUTTING MY FINGER ON A PHOTOGRAPH “THERE THAT’S SANTILLANA THE PRETTIEST TOWN IN SPAIN.”

“THE SANTILLANA OF GIL BLAS? I DIDN’T BELIEVE IT EXISTED. AH MONSIEUR HOW PROFITABLE YOUR CONVERSATION IS. ONE CAN TELL YOU’VE TRAVELLED.”

I PUT OUT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN AFTER FILLING HIS POCKETS WITH POST CARDS PRINTS AND PHOTOS. HE LEFT ENCHANTED AND I SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHT. I AM ALONE NOW. NOT QUITE ALONE. HOVERING IN FRONT OF ME IS STILL THIS IDEA. IT HAS ROLLED ITSELF INTO A BALL IT STAYS THERE LIKE A LARGE CAT; IT EXPLAINS NOTHING IT DOES NOT MOVE AND CONTENTS ITSELF WITH SAYING NO. NO I HAVEN’T HAD ANY ADVENTURES.

I FILL MY PIPE LIGHT IT AND STRETCH OUT ON THE BED THROWING A COAT OVER MY LEGS. WHAT ASTONISHES ME IS TO FEEL SO SAD AND EXHAUSTED. EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE—THAT I NEVER HAD ANY ADVENTURES—WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THAT MAKE TO ME? FIRST IT SEEMS TO BE A PURE QUESTION OF WORDS. THIS BUSINESS AT MEKNES FOR EXAMPLE I WAS THINKING ABOUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO: A MOROCCAN JUMPED ON ME AND WANTED TO STAB ME WITH AN ENORMOUS KNIFE. BUT I HIT HIM JUST BELOW THE TEMPLE . . . THEN HE BEGAN SHOUTING IN ARABIC AND A SWARM OF LOUSY BEGGARS CAME UP AND CHASED US ALL THE WAY TO SOUK ATTARIN. WELL YOU CAN CALL THAT BY ANY NAME YOU LIKE IN ANY CASE IT WAS AN EVENT WHICH HAPPENED TO ME.

IT IS COMPLETELY DARK AND I CAN’T TELL WHETHER MY PIPE IS LIT. A TROLLEY PASSES: RED LIGHT ON THE CEILING. THEN A HEAVY TRUCK WHICH MAKES THE HOUSE TREMBLE. IT MUST BE SIX O’CLOCK.

I HAVE NEVER HAD ADVENTURES. THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO ME EVENTS INCIDENTS ANYTHING YOU LIKE. BUT NO ADVENTURES. IT ISN’T A QUESTION OF WORDS; I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND. THERE IS SOMETHING TO WHICH I CLUNG MORE THAN ALL THE REST—WITHOUT COMPLETELY REALIZING IT. IT WASN’T LOVE. HEAVEN FORBID NOT GLORY NOT MONEY. IT WAS . . . I HAD IMAGINED THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES MY LIFE COULD TAKE ON A RARE AND PRECIOUS QUALITY. THERE WAS NO NEED FOR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES: ALL I ASKED FOR WAS A LITTLE PRECISION. THERE IS NOTHING BRILLIANT ABOUT MY LIFE NOW: BUT FROM TIME TO TIME FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY PLAY MUSIC IN THE CAFÉS I LOOK BACK AND TELL MYSELF: IN OLD DAYS IN LONDON MEKNES TOKYO I HAVE KNOWN GREAT MOMENTS I HAVE HAD ADVENTURES. NOW I AM DEPRIVED OF THIS. I HAVE SUDDENLY LEARNED WITHOUT ANY APPARENT REASON THAT I HAVE BEEN LYING TO MYSELF FOR TEN YEARS. AND NATURALLY EVERYTHING THEY TELL ABOUT IN BOOKS CAN HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE BUT NOT IN THE SAME WAY. IT IS TO THIS WAY OF HAPPENING THAT I CLUNG SO TIGHTLY.

THE BEGINNINGS WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE REAL BEGINNINGS. ALAS! NOW I SEE SO CLEARLY WHAT I WANTED. REAL BEGINNINGS ARE LIKE A FANFARE OF TRUMPETS LIKE THE FIRST NOTES OF A JAZZ TUNE CUTTING SHORT TEDIUM MAKING FOR CONTINUITY: THEN YOU SAY ABOUT THESE EVENINGS WITHIN EVENINGS: “I WAS OUT FOR A WALK IT WAS AN EVENING IN MAY.” YOU WALK THE MOON HAS JUST RISEN YOU FEEL LAZY VACANT A LITTLE EMPTY. AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU THINK: “SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.” NO MATTER WHAT: A SLIGHT RUSTLING IN THE SHADOW A THIN SILHOUETTE CROSSING THE STREET. BUT THIS PALTRY EVENT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS: SUDDENLY YOU SEE THAT IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT SHAPE WHOSE OUTLINES ARE LOST IN MIST AND YOU TELL YOURSELF “SOMETHING IS BEGINNING.”

SOMETHING IS BEGINNING IN ORDER TO END: ADVENTURE DOES NOT LET ITSELF BE DRAWN OUT; IT ONLY MAKES SENSE WHEN DEAD. I AM DRAWN IRREVOCABLY TOWARDS THIS DEATH WHICH IS PERHAPS MINE AS WELL. EACH INSTANT APPEARS ONLY AS PART OF A SEQUENCE. I CLING TO EACH INSTANT WITH ALL MY HEART: I KNOW THAT IT IS UNIQUE IRREPLACEABLE —AND YET I WOULD NOT RAISE A FINGER TO STOP IT FROM BEING ANNIHILATED. THIS LAST MOMENT I AM SPENDING—IN BERLIN IN LONDON—IN THE ARMS OF A WOMAN CASUALLY MET TWO DAYS AGO—MOMENT I LOVE PASSIONATELY WOMAN I MAY ADORE—ALL IS GOING TO END I KNOW IT. SOON I SHALL LEAVE FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY. I SHALL NEVER REDISCOVER EITHER THIS WOMAN OR THIS NIGHT. I GRASP AT EACH SECOND TRYING TO SUCK IT DRY: NOTHING HAPPENS WHICH I DO NOT SEIZE WHICH I DO NOT FIX FOREVER IN MYSELF NOTHING NEITHER THE FUGITIVE TENDERNESS OF THOSE LOVELY EYES NOR THE NOISES OF THE STREET NOR THE FALSE DAWN OF EARLY MORNING: AND EVEN SO THE MINUTE PASSES AND I DO NOT HOLD IT BACK I LIKE TO SEE IT PASS.

ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING BREAKS OFF SHARPLY. THE ADVENTURE IS OVER TIME RESUMES ITS DAILY ROUTINE. I TURN; BEHIND ME THIS BEAUTIFUL MELODIOUS FORM SINKS ENTIRELY INTO THE PAST. IT GROWS SMALLER CONTRACTS AS IT DECLINES AND NOW THE END MAKES ONE WITH THE BEGINNING. FOLLOWING THIS GOLD SPOT WITH MY EYES I THINK I WOULD ACCEPT—EVEN IF I HAD TO RISK DEATH LOSE A FORTUNE A FRIEND—TO LIVE IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES FROM END TO END. BUT AN ADVENTURE NEVER RETURNS NOR IS PROLONGED.

YES IT’S WHAT I WANTED—WHAT I STILL WANT. I AM SO HAPPY WHEN A NEGRESS SINGS: WHAT SUMMITS WOULD I NOT REACH IF MY OWN LIFE MADE THE SUBJECT OF THE MELODY.

THE IDEA IS STILL THERE UNNAMEABLE. IT WAITS PEACEFULLY. NOW IT SEEMS TO SAY:

“YES? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED? WELL THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU’VE NEVER HAD (REMEMBER YOU FOOLED YOURSELF WITH WORDS YOU CALLED THE GLITTER OF TRAVEL THE LOVE OF WOMEN QUARRELS AND TRINKETS ADVENTURE) AND THIS IS WHAT YOU’LL NEVER HAVE—AND NO ONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF.”

BUT WHY? WHY?

SATURDAY NOON:

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DID NOT SEE ME COME INTO THE READING-ROOM. HE WAS SITTING AT THE END OF A TABLE IN THE BACK; HE HAD SET HIS BOOK DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM BUT HE WAS NOT READING. HE WAS SMILING AT A SEEDY-LOOKING STUDENT WHO OFTEN COMES TO THE LIBRARY. THE STUDENT ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE LOOKED AT FOR A MOMENT THEN SUDDENLY STUCK HIS TONGUE OUT AND MADE A HORRIBLE FACE. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN BLUSHED HURRIEDLY PLUNGED HIS NOSE INTO HIS BOOK AND BECAME ABSORBED BY HIS READING.

I HAVE RECONSIDERED MY THOUGHTS OF YESTERDAY. I WAS COMPLETELY DRY: IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN NO ADVENTURES. I WAS ONLY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER THERE COULD NEVER BE ANY.

THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT: FOR THE MOST BANAL EVEN TO BECOME AN ADVENTURE YOU MUST (AND THIS IS ENOUGH) BEGIN TO RECOUNT IT. THIS IS WHAT FOOLS PEOPLE: A MAN IS ALWAYS A TELLER OF TALES HE LIVES SURROUNDED BY HIS STORIES AND THE STORIES OF OTHERS HE SEES EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO HIM THROUGH THEM; AND HE TRIES TO LIVE HIS OWN LIFE AS IF HE WERE TELLING A STORY.

BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE: LIVE OR TELL. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS IN HAMBURG WITH THAT ERNA GIRL I DIDN’T TRUST AND WHO WAS AFRAID OF ME I LED A FUNNY SORT OF LIFE. BUT I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I DIDN’T THINK ABOUT IT. AND THEN ONE EVENING IN A LITTLE CAFÉ IN SAN PAULI SHE LEFT ME TO GO TO THE LADIES’ ROOM. I STAYED ALONE THERE WAS A PHONOGRAPH PLAYING “BLUE SKIES.” I BEGAN TO TELL MYSELF WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE I LANDED. I TOLD MYSELF “THE THIRD EVENING AS I WAS GOING INTO A DANCE HALL CALLED LA GROTTE BLEUE I NOTICED A LARGE WOMAN HALF SEAS OVER. AND THAT WOMAN IS THE ONE I AM WAITING FOR NOW LISTENING TO ‘BLUE SKIES’ THE WOMAN WHO IS GOING TO COME BACK AND SIT DOWN AT MY RIGHT AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK.” THEN I FELT VIOLENTLY THAT I WAS HAVING AN ADVENTURE. BUT ERNA CAME BACK AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME SHE WOUND HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND I HATED HER WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. I UNDERSTAND NOW: ONE HAD TO BEGIN LIVING AGAIN AND THE ADVENTURE WAS FADING OUT.

NOTHING HAPPENS WHILE YOU LIVE. THE SCENERY CHANGES PEOPLE COME IN AND GO OUT THAT’S ALL. THERE ARE NO BEGINNINGS. DAYS ARE TACKED ON TO DAYS WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON AN INTERMINABLE MONOTONOUS ADDITION. FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MAKE A SEMI-TOTAL: YOU SAY: I’VE BEEN TRAVELLING FOR THREE YEARS I’VE BEEN IN BOUVILLE FOR THREE YEARS. NEITHER IS THERE ANY END: YOU NEVER LEAVE A WOMAN A FRIEND A CITY IN ONE GO. AND THEN EVERYTHING LOOKS ALIKE: SHANGHAI MOSCOW ALGIERS EVERYTHING IS THE SAME AFTER TWO WEEKS. THERE ARE MOMENTS—RARELY—WHEN YOU MAKE A LANDMARK YOU REALIZE THAT YOU’RE GOING WITH A WOMAN IN SOME MESSY BUSINESS. THE TIME OF A FLASH. AFTER THAT THE PROCESSION STARTS AGAIN YOU BEGIN TO ADD UP HOURS AND DAYS: MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY. APRIL MAY JUNE. 1924 1925 1926.

THAT’S LIVING. BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES WHEN YOU TELL ABOUT LIFE; IT’S A CHANGE NO ONE NOTICES: THE PROOF IS THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRUE STORIES. AS IF THERE COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE STORIES; THINGS HAPPEN ONE WAY AND WE TELL ABOUT THEM IN THE OPPOSITE SENSE. YOU SEEM TO START AT THE BEGINNING: “IT WAS A FINE AUTUMN EVENING IN 1922. I WAS A NOTARY’S CLERK IN MAROMMES.” AND IN REALITY YOU HAVE STARTED AT THE END. IT WAS THERE INVISIBLE AND PRESENT IT IS THE ONE WHICH GIVES TO WORDS THE POMP AND VALUE OF A BEGINNING. “I WAS OUT WALKING I HAD LEFT THE TOWN WITHOUT REALIZING IT I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY MONEY TROUBLES.” THIS SENTENCE TAKEN SIMPLY FOR WHAT IT IS MEANS THAT THE MAN WAS ABSORBED MOROSE A HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM AN ADVENTURE EXACTLY IN THE MOOD TO LET THINGS HAPPEN WITHOUT NOTICING THEM. BUT THE END IS THERE TRANSFORMING EVERYTHING. FOR US THE MAN IS ALREADY THE HERO OF THE STORY. HIS MOROSENESS HIS MONEY TROUBLES ARE MUCH MORE PRECIOUS THAN OURS THEY ARE ALL GILDED BY THE LIGHT OF FUTURE PASSIONS. AND THE STORY GOES ON IN THE REVERSE: INSTANTS HAVE STOPPED PILING THEMSELVES IN A LIGHTHEARTED WAY ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY ARE SNAPPED UP BY THE END OF THE STORY WHICH DRAWS THEM AND EACH ONE OF THEM IN TURN DRAWS OUT THE PRECEDING INSTANT: “IT WAS NIGHT THE STREET WAS DESERTED.” THE PHRASE IS CAST OUT NEGLIGENTLY IT SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS; BUT WE DO NOT LET OURSELVES BE CAUGHT AND WE PUT IT ASIDE: THIS IS A PIECE OF INFORMATION WHOSE VALUE WE SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY APPRECIATE. AND WE FEEL THAT THE HERO HAS LIVED ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS NIGHT LIKE ANNUNCIATIONS PROMISES OR EVEN THAT HE LIVED ONLY THOSE THAT WERE PROMISES BLIND AND DEAF TO ALL THAT DID NOT HERALD ADVENTURE. WE FORGET THAT THE FUTURE WAS NOT YET THERE; THE MAN WAS WALKING IN A NIGHT WITHOUT FORETHOUGHT A NIGHT WHICH OFFERED HIM A CHOICE OF DULL RICH PRIZES AND HE DID NOT MAKE HIS CHOICE.

I WANTED THE MOMENTS OF MY LIFE TO FOLLOW AND ORDER THEMSELVES LIKE THOSE OF A LIFE REMEMBERED. YOU MIGHT AS WELL TRY AND CATCH TIME BY THE TAIL.

SUNDAY:

I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THIS MORNING WAS SUNDAY. I WENT OUT AND WALKED ALONG THE STREETS AS USUAL. I HAD TAKEN ALONG EUGÉNIE GRANDET. THEN SUDDENLY WHEN OPENING THE GATE OF THE PUBLIC PARK I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT SOMETHING WAS SIGNALLING TO ME. THE PARK WAS BARE AND DESERTED. BUT . . . HOW CAN I EXPLAIN?

IT DIDN’T HAVE ITS USUAL LOOK IT SMILED AT ME. I LEANED AGAINST THE RAILING FOR A MOMENT THEN SUDDENLY REALIZED IT WAS SUNDAY. IT WAS THERE—ON THE TREES ON THE GRASS LIKE A FAINT SMILE. IT COULDN’T BE DESCRIBED YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO REPEAT VERY QUICKLY: “THIS IS A PUBLIC PARK THIS IS WINTER THIS IS SUNDAY MORNING.”

I LET GO OF THE RAILING TURNED BACK TOWARDS THE HOUSES AND STREETS OF THE TOWN AND HALF-ALOUD I MURMURED “IT’S SUNDAY.”

IT’S SUNDAY: BEHIND THE DOCKS ALONG THE SEACOAST NEAR THE FREIGHT STATION ALL AROUND THE CITY THERE ARE EMPTY WAREHOUSES AND MOTIONLESS MACHINES IN THE DARKNESS. IN ALL THE HOUSES MEN ARE SHAVING BEHIND THEIR WINDOWS; THEIR HEADS ARE THROWN BACK SOMETIMES THEY STARE AT THE LOOKING GLASS SOMETIMES AT THE SKY TO SEE WHETHER IT’S GOING TO BE A FINE DAY. THE BROTHELS ARE OPENING TO THEIR FIRST CUSTOMERS RUSTICS AND SOLDIERS. IN THE CHURCHES IN THE LIGHT OF CANDLES A MAN IS DRINKING WINE IN THE SIGHT OF KNEELING WOMEN. IN ALL THE SUBURBS BETWEEN THE INTERMINABLE WALLS OF FACTORIES LONG BLACK PROCESSIONS HAVE STARTED WALKING THEY ARE SLOWLY ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN. TO RECEIVE THEM THE STREETS HAVE TAKEN ON THE LOOK THEY HAVE WHEN DISTURBANCE IS EXPECTED ALL THE STORES EXCEPT THE ONES ON THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE HAVE LOWERED THEIR IRON SHUTTERS. SOON SILENTLY THESE BLACK COLUMNS ARE GOING TO INVADE THE DEATH-SHAMMING STREETS: FIRST THE RAILROAD WORKERS FROM TOURVILLE AND THEIR WIVES WHO WORK IN THE SAINT-SYMPHORIN SOAP FACTORIES THEN THE LITTLE BOURGEOIS FROM JOUXTEBOUVILLE THEN THE WORKERS FROM THE PINOT WEAVING MILLS THEN ALL THE ODD JOBBERS FROM THE SAINT-MAXENCE QUARTER; THE MEN FROM THIERACHE WILL ARRIVE LAST ON THE ELEVEN O’CLOCK TROLLEY. SOON THE SUNDAY CROWD WILL BE BORN BETWEEN BOLTED SHOPS AND CLOSED DOORS.

A CLOCK STRIKES HALF-PAST TEN AND I START ON MY WAY: SUNDAYS AT THIS HOUR YOU CAN SEE A FINE SHOW IN BOUVILLE BUT YOU MUST NOT COME TOO LATE AFTER HIGH MASS.

THE LITTLE RUE JOSÉPHIN-SOULARY IS DEAD IT SMELLS OF A CELLAR. BUT AS ON EVERY SUNDAY IT IS FILLED WITH A SUMPTUOUS NOISE A NOISE LIKE A TIDE. I TURN INTO THE RUE DE PRÉSIDENT-CHAMART WHERE THE HOUSES HAVE FOUR STOREYS WITH LONG WHITE VENETIAN BLINDS. THIS STREET OF NOTARIES IS ENTIRELY FILLED BY THE VOLUMINOUS CLAMOUR OF SUNDAY. THE NOISE INCREASES IN THE PASSAGE GILLET AND I RECOGNIZE IT: IT IS A NOISE WHICH MEN MAKE. THEN SUDDENLY ON THE LEFT COMES AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT AND SOUND: HERE IS THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TAKE MY PLACE AMONG MY FELLOWS AND WATCH THEM RAISING THEIR HATS TO EACH OTHER.

SIXTY YEARS AGO NO ONE COULD HAVE FORSEEN THE MIRACULOUS DESTINY OF THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF BOUVILLE TODAY CALL THE LITTLE PRADO. I SAW A MAP DATED 1847 ON WHICH THE STREET WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED. AT THAT TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DARK STINKING BOWEL WITH A TRENCH BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES IN WHICH FISHES’ HEADS AND ENTRAILS WERE STACKED. BUT AT THE END OF 1873 THE ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE DECLARED THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CHURCH ON THE SLOPE OF MONTMARTRE TO BE OF PUBLIC UTILITY. A FEW MONTHS LATER THE MAYOR’S WIFE HAD A VISION: SAINTE CÉCILE HER PATRON SAINT CAME TO REMONSTRATE WITH HER. WAS IT TOLERABLE FOR THE ÉLITE TO SOIL THEMSELVES EVERY SUNDAY GOING TO SAINT-RENÉ OR SAINT-CLAUDIEN TO HEAR MASS WITH SHOPKEEPERS? HADN’T THE ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE SET AN EXAMPLE? BOUVILLE NOW HAD THANKS TO THE PROTECTION OF HEAVEN A FIRST-CLASS FINANCIAL POSITION; WOULDN’T IT BE FITTING TO BUILD A CHURCH WHEREIN TO GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD?

THESE VISIONS WERE ACCEPTED: THE CITY COUNCIL HELD A HISTORIC MEETING AND THE BISHOP AGREED TO ORGANIZE A SUBSCRIPTION. ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS THE CHOICE OF LOCALITY. THE OLD FAMILIES OF BUSINESSMEN AND SHIPOWNERS WERE OF THE OPINION THAT THE BUILDING SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE COTEAU VERT WHERE THEY LIVED “SO THAT SAINT CÉCILE COULD WATCH OVER BOUVILLE AS THE SACRÉ-COEUR-DE-JÉSUS OVER PARIS.” THE NOUVEAU-RICHE GENTLEMEN OF THE BOULEVARD MARITIME OF WHICH THERE WERE ONLY A FEW SHOOK THEIR HEADS: THEY WOULD GIVE ALL THAT WAS NEEDED BUT THE CHURCH WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT ON THE PLACE MARIGNAN; IF THEY WERE GOING TO PAY FOR A CHURCH THEY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO USE IT; THEY WERE NOT RELUCTANT TO MAKE THEIR POWER FELT BY THE HIGHER BOURGEOISIE WHO CONSIDERED THEM PARVENUS. THE BISHOP SUGGESTED A COMPROMISE: THE CHURCH WAS BUILT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE COTEAU VERT AND THE BOULEVARD MARITIME ON THE PLACE DE LA HALLE-AUX-MORUES WHICH WAS BAPTISED PLACE SAINTE-CÉCILE-DE-LA-MER. THIS MONSTROUS EDIFICE COMPLETED IN 1887 COST NO LESS THAN FOURTEEN MILLION FRANCS.

THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE WIDE BUT DIRTY AND OF ILL-REPUTE HAD TO BE ENTIRELY REBUILT AND ITS INHABITANTS FIRMLY PUSHED BACK BEHIND THE PLACE SAINT-CÉCILE; THE LITTLE PRADO BECAME—ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY MORNINGS—THE MEETING PLACE OF ELEGANT AND DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE. FINE SHOPS OPENED ONE BY ONE ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ÉLITE. THEY STAYED OPEN EASTER MONDAY ALL CHRISTMAS NIGHT AND EVERY SUNDAY UNTIL NOON. NEXT TO JULIEN THE PORK BUTCHER RENOWNED FOR HIS PÂTÉS CHAUDS FOULON THE PASTRY COOK EXHIBITS HIS FAMOUS SPECIALTIES CONICAL PETITS-FOURS MADE OF MAUVE BUTTER TOPPED BY A SUGAR VIOLET. IN THE WINDOW OF DUPATY’S LIBRARY YOU CAN SEE THE LATEST BOOKS PUBLISHED BY PION A FEW TECHNICAL WORKS SUCH AS A THEORY OF NAVIGATION OR A TREATISE ON SAILS AND SAILING AN ENORMOUS ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF BOUVILLE AND ELEGANTLY APPOINTED EDITIONS DE LUXE: KOENIGSMARK BOUND IN BLUE LEATHER THE LIVRE DE MES FILS BY PAUL DOUMER BOUND IN TAN LEATHER WITH PURPLE FLOWERS. GHISLAINE (HAUTE COUTURE PARISIAN MODELS) SEPARATES PIÉGEOIS THE FLORIST FROM PAQUIN THE ANTIQUE DEALER. GUSTAVE THE HAIR DRESSER WHO EMPLOYS FOUR MANICURISTS OCCUPIES THE SECOND FLOOR OF AN ENTIRELY NEW YELLOW PAINTED BUILDING.

TWO YEARS AGO AT THE CORNER OF THE IMPASSE DES MOULINSGÉMEAUX AND THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE AN IMPUDENT LITTLE SHOP STILL ADVERTISED FOR THE TU-PU-NEZ INSECTICIDE. IT HAD FLOURISHED IN THE TIME WHEN CODFISH WERE HAWKED IN THE PLACE SAINTE-CÉCILE; IT WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. THE WINDOWS WERE RARELY WASHED: IT REQUIRED A GREAT EFFORT TO DISTINGUISH THROUGH DUST AND MIST A CROWD OF TINY WAX FIGURES DECKED OUT IN ORANGE DOUBLETS REPRESENTING RATS AND MICE. THESE ANIMALS WERE DISEMBARKING FROM A HIGH-DECKED SHIP LEANING ON STICKS; BARELY HAD THEY TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN A PEASANT GIRL ATTRACTIVELY DRESSED BUT FILTHY AND BLACK WITH DIRT PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT BY SPRINKLING THEM WITH TU-PU-NEZ. I LIKED THIS SHOP VERY MUCH IT HAD A CYNICAL AND OBSTINATE LOOK IT INSOLENTLY RECALLED THE RIGHTS OF DIRT AND VERMIN ONLY TWO PACES FROM THE MOST COSTLY CHURCH IN FRANCE.

THE OLD HERBORIST DIED LAST YEAR AND HER NEPHEW SOLD THE HOUSE. IT WAS ENOUGH TO TEAR DOWN A FEW WALLS: IT IS NOW A SMALL LECTURE HALL “LA BONBONNIÈRE.” LAST YEAR HENRY BORDEAUX GAVE A TALK ON ALPINISM THERE.

YOU MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY IN THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE: THE FAMILIES WALK SLOWLY. SOMETIMES YOU MOVE UP A STEP BECAUSE ONE FAMILY HAS TURNED INTO FOULON’S OR PIÉGEOIS’. BUT AT OTHER TIMES YOU MUST STOP AND MARK TIME BECAUSE TWO FAMILIES ONE GOING UP THE STREET THE OTHER COMING DOWN HAVE MET AND HAVE SOLIDLY CLASPED HANDS. I GO FORWARD SLOWLY. I STAND A WHOLE HEAD ABOVE BOTH COLUMNS AND I SEE HATS A SEA OF HATS. MOST OF THEM ARE BLACK AND HARD. FROM TIME TO TIME YOU SEE ONE FLY OFF AT THE END OF AN ARM AND YOU CATCH THE SOFT GLINT OF A SKULL; THEN AFTER A FEW INSTANTS OF HEAVY FLIGHT IT RETURNS. AT 16 RUE TOURNEBRIDE URBAIN THE HATTER SPECIALIZING IN FORAGE CAPS HAS HUNG UP AS A SYMBOL AN IMMENSE RED ARCHBISHOP’S HAT WHOSE GOLD TASSELS HANG SIX FEET FROM THE GROUND.

A HALT: A GROUP HAS COLLECTED JUST UNDER THE TASSELS. MY NEIGHBOUR WAITS IMPATIENTLY HIS ARMS DANGLING: THIS LITTLE OLD MAN PALE AND FRAGILE AS PORCELAIN—I THINK HE MUST BE COFFIER—PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. IT SEEMS HE IS INTIMIDATING BECAUSE HE NEVER SPEAKS. HE LIVES ON THE SUMMIT OF THE COTEAU VERT IN A GREAT BRICK HOUSE WHOSE WINDOWS ARE ALWAYS WIDE OPEN. IT’S OVER: THE GROUP HAS BROKEN UP. ANOTHER GROUP STARTS FORMING BUT IT TAKES UP LESS SPACE: BARELY FORMED IT IS PUSHED AGAINST GHISLAINE’S WINDOW FRONT. THE COLUMN DOES NOT EVEN STOP: IT HARDLY MAKES A MOVE TO STEP ASIDE; WE ARE WALKING IN FRONT OF SIX PEOPLE WHO HOLD HANDS: “BONJOUR MONSIEUR BONJOUR CHER MONSIEUR COMMENT ALLEZ-VOUS? DO PUT YOUR HAT ON AGAIN YOU’LL CATCH COLD; THANK YOU MADAME IT ISN’T VERY WARM OUT IS IT? MY DEAR LET ME PRESENT DOCTOR LEFRANÇOIS; DOCTOR I AM VERY GLAD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SPEAKS OF DOCTOR LEFRANÇOIS WHO TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIM BUT DO PUT YOUR HAT ON DOCTOR YOU’LL CATCH COLD. BUT A DOCTOR WOULD GET WELL QUICKLY; ALAS! MADAME DOCTORS ARE THE LEAST WELL LOOKED AFTER; THE DOCTOR IS A REMARKABLE MUSICIAN. REALLY DOCTOR? BUT I NEVER KNEW YOU PLAY THE VIOLIN? THE DOCTOR IS VERY GIFTED.”

THE LITTLE OLD MAN NEXT TO ME IS SURELY COFFIER; ONE OF THE WOMEN OF THE GROUP THE BRUNETTE IS DEVOURING HIM WITH HER EYES ALL THE WHILE SMILING AT THE DOCTOR. SHE SEEMS TO BE THINKING “THERE’S MONSIEUR COFFIER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE; HOW INTIMIDATING HE LOOKS THEY SAY HE’S SO FRIGID.” BUT M. COFFIER DEIGNS TO SEE NOTHING: THESE PEOPLE ARE FROM THE BOULEVARD MARITIME THEY DO NOT BELONG TO HIS WORLD. SINCE I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THIS STREET TO SEE THE SUNDAY HAT-RAISING I HAVE LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH PEOPLE FROM THE BOULEVARD AND PEOPLE FROM THE COTEAU. WHEN A MAN WEARS A NEW OVERCOAT A SOFT FELT HAT A DAZZLING SHIRT WHEN HE CREATES A VACUUM IN PASSING THERE’S NO MISTAKING IT: HE IS SOMEONE FROM THE BOULEVARD MARITIME. YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM THE COTEAU VERT BY SOME KIND OF SHABBY SUNKEN LOOK. THEY HAVE NARROW SHOULDERS AND AN AIR OF INSOLENCE ON THEIR WORN FACES. THIS FAT GENTLEMAN HOLDING A CHILD BY THE HAND—I’D SWEAR HE COMES FROM THE COTEAU: HIS FACE IS ALL GREY AND HIS TIE KNOTTED LIKE A STRING.

THE FAT MAN COMES NEAR US: HE STARES AT M. COFFIER. BUT JUST BEFORE HE CROSSES HIS PATH HE TURNS HIS HEAD AWAY AND BEGINS JOKING IN A FATHERLY WAY WITH HIS LITTLE BOY. HE TAKES A FEW MORE STEPS BENT OVER HIS SON HIS EYES GAZING IN THE CHILD’S EYES NOTHING BUT A FATHER; THEN SUDDENLY HE TURNS QUICKLY TOWARDS US THROWS A QUICK GLANCE AT THE LITTLE OLD MAN AND MAKES AN AMPLE QUICK SALUTE WITH A SWEEP OF HIS ARM. DISCONCERTED THE LITTLE BOY HAS NOT TAKEN OFF HIS HAT: THIS IS AN AFFAIR BETWEEN GROWN-UPS.

AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE BASSE-DE-VIEILLE OUR COLUMN ABUTS INTO A COLUMN OF THE FAITHFUL COMING OUT OF MASS: A DOZEN PERSONS RUSH FORWARD SHAKING EACH OTHER’S HAND AND WHIRLING ROUND BUT THE HAT-RAISING IS OVER TOO QUICKLY FOR ME TO CATCH THE DETAILS; THE EGLISE SAINTE-CÉCILE STANDS A MONSTROUS MASS ABOVE THE FAT PALE CROWD: CHALK WHITE AGAINST A SOMBRE SKY; ITS SIDES HOLD A LITTLE OF THE NIGHT’S DARKNESS BEHIND THESE SHINING WALLS. WE ARE OFF AGAIN IN A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED ORDER. M. COFFIER HAS BEEN PUSHED BEHIND ME. A LADY DRESSED IN NAVY BLUE IS GLUED TO MY LEFT SIDE. SHE HAS COME FROM MASS. SHE BLINKS HER EYES A LITTLE DAZZLED AT COMING INTO THE LIGHT OF MORNING. THE GENTLEMAN WALKING IN FRONT OF HER WHO HAS SUCH A THIN NECK IS HER HUSBAND.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET A GENTLEMAN HOLDING HIS WIFE BY THE ARM HAS JUST WHISPERED A FEW WORDS IN HER EAR AND HAS STARTED TO SMILE. SHE IMMEDIATELY WIPES ALL EXPRESSION FROM HER CHALKY CREAM COLOURED FACE AND BLINDLY TAKES A FEW STEPS. THERE IS NO MISTAKING THESE SIGNS: THEY ARE GOING TO GREET SOMEBODY. INDEED AFTER A MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN THROWS HIS HANDS UP. WHEN HIS FINGERS REACH HIS FELT HAT THEY HESITATE A SECOND BEFORE COMING DOWN DELICATELY ON THE CROWN. WHILE HE SLOWLY RAISES HIS HAT BOWING HIS HEAD A LITTLE TO HELP ITS REMOVAL HIS WIFE GIVES A LITTLE START AND FORCES A YOUNG SMILE ON HER FACE. A BOWING SHADOW PASSES THEM: BUT THEIR TWIN SMILES DO NOT DISAPPEAR IMMEDIATELY: THEY STAY ON THEIR LIPS A FEW INSTANTS BY A SORT OF MAGNETISM. THE LADY AND GENTLEMAN HAVE REGAINED THEIR IMPASSIBILITY BY THE TIME THEY PASS ME BUT A CERTAIN AIR OF GAIETY STILL LINGERS AROUND THEIR MOUTHS.

IT’S FINISHED: THE CROWD IS LESS CONGESTED THE HAT-RAISINGS LESS FREQUENT THE SHOP WINDOWS HAVE SOMETHING LESS EXQUISITE ABOUT THEM: I AM AT THE END OF THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE. SHALL I CROSS AND GO UP THE STREET ON THE OTHER SIDE? I THINK I HAVE HAD ENOUGH: I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH PINK SKULLS THIN DISTINGUISHED AND FADED COUNTENANCES. I AM GOING TO CROSS THE PLACE MARIGNAN. AS I CAUTIOUSLY EXTRICATE MYSELF FROM THE COLUMN THE FACE OF A REAL GENTLEMAN IN A BLACK HAT SPRINGS UP NEAR ME. THE HUSBAND OF THE LADY IN NAVY BLUE. AH THE FINE LONG DOLICHOCEPHALIC SKULL PLANTED WITH SHORT WIRY HAIR THE HANDSOME AMERICAN MOUSTACHE SOWN WITH SILVER THREADS. AND THE SMILE ABOVE ALL THE ADMIRABLE CULTIVATED SMILE. THERE IS ALSO AN EYEGLASS SOMEWHERE ON A NOSE.

TURNING TO HIS WIFE HE SAYS:

“HE’S A NEW FACTORY DESIGNER. I WONDER WHAT HE CAN BE DOING HERE. HE’S A GOOD BOY HE’S TIMID AND HE AMUSES ME.”

STANDING AGAINST THE WINDOW OF JULIEN THE PORK BUTCHER’S SHOP THE YOUNG DESIGNER WHO HAS JUST DONE HIS HAIR STILL PINK HIS EYES LOWERED AN OBSTINATE LOOK ON HIS FACE HAS ALL THE APPEARANCE OF A VOLUPTUARY. THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FIRST SUNDAY HE HAS DARED CROSS THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE. HE LOOKS LIKE A LAD WHO HAS BEEN TO HIS FIRST COMMUNION. HE HAS CROSSED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK AND TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS THE WINDOW WITH AN AIR OF EXCITING MODESTY; WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE HE LOOKS AT FOUR SMALL SAUSAGES SHINING IN GELATINE SPREAD OUT ON A BED OF PARSLEY.

A WOMAN COMES OUT OF THE SHOP AND TAKES HIS ARM. HIS WIFE. SHE IS QUITE YOUNG DESPITE HER POCKED SKIN. SHE CAN STROLL ALONG THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKES NO ONE WILL MISTAKE HER FOR A LADY; SHE IS BETRAYED BY THE CYNICAL SPARKLE OF HER EYES BY HER SOPHISTICATED LOOK. REAL LADIES DO NOT KNOW THE PRICE OF THINGS THEY LIKE ADORABLE FOLLIES; THEIR EYES ARE LIKE BEAUTIFUL HOTHOUSE FLOWERS.

I REACH THE BRASSERIE VÉZELISE ON THE STROKE OF ONE. THE OLD MEN ARE THERE AS USUAL. TWO OF THEM HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO EAT. FOUR ARE PLAYING CARDS AND DRINKING APÉRITIFS. THE OTHERS ARE STANDING WATCHING THEM PLAY WHILE THEIR TABLE IS BEING LAID. THE BIGGEST THE ONE WITH A FLOWING BEARD IS A STOCKBROKER. ANOTHER IS A RETIRED COMMISSIONER FROM THE INSCRIPTION MARITIME. THEY EAT AND DRINK LIKE MEN OF TWENTY. THEY EAT SAUERKRAUT ON SUNDAY. THE LATE ARRIVALS QUESTION THE OTHERS WHO ARE ALREADY EATING:

“THE USUAL SUNDAY SAUERKRAUT?”

THEY SIT DOWN AND BREATHE SIGHS OF RELAXATION:

“MARIETTE DEAR A BEER WITHOUT A HEAD AND A SAUERKRAUT.”

THIS MARIETTE IS A BUXOM WENCH. AS I SIT DOWN AT A TABLE IN THE BACK A RED-FACED OLD MAN BEGINS COUGHING FURIOUSLY WHILE BEING SERVED WITH A VERMOUTH.

“COME ON POUR ME OUT A LITTLE MORE” HE SAYS COUGHING.

BUT SHE GROWS ANGRY HERSELF: SHE HADN’T FINISHED POURING:

“WELL LET ME POUR WILL YOU? WHO SAID ANYTHING TO YOU?
YOU HOLLER BEFORE YOU’RE HURT.”

THE OTHERS BEGIN TO LAUGH.

“TOUCHÉ!”

THE STOCKBROKER GOING TO HIS SEAT TAKES MARIETTE BY THE SHOULDERS:

“IT’S SUNDAY MARIETTE. I GUESS WE HAVE OUR BOYFRIEND TO TAKE US TO THE MOVIES?”

“OH SURE! THIS IS ANTOINETTE’S DAY OFF. I’VE GOT A DATE IN HERE ALL DAY.”

THE STOCKBROKER HAS TAKEN A CHAIR OPPOSITE THE CLEAN-SHAVEN LUGUBRIOUS-LOOKING OLD MAN. THE CLEAN-SHAVEN OLD MAN IMMEDIATELY BEGINS AN ANIMATED STORY. THE STOCKBROKER DOES NOT LISTEN TO HIM: HE MAKES FACES AND PULLS AT HIS BEARD. THEY NEVER LISTEN TO EACH OTHER.

I RECOGNIZE MY NEIGHBOURS: SMALL BUSINESSMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. SUNDAY IS THEIR MAIDS’ DAY OFF. SO THEY COME HERE ALWAYS SITTING AT THE SAME TABLE. THE HUSBAND EATS A FINE RIB OF UNDERDONE BEEF. HE LOOKS AT IT CLOSELY AND SMELLS IT FROM TIME TO TIME. THE WIFE PICKS AT HER PLATE. A HEAVY BLONDE WOMAN OF FORTY WITH RED DOWNY CHEEKS. SHE HAS FINE HARD BREASTS UNDER HER SATIN BLOUSE. LIKE A MAN SHE POLISHES OFF A BOTTLE OF BORDEAUX AT EVERY MEAL.

I AM GOING TO READ EUGÉNIE GRANDET IT ISN’T THAT I GET ANY GREAT PLEASURE OUT OF IT: BUT I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I OPEN THE BOOK AT RANDOM: THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER ARE SPEAKING OF EUGÉNIE’S GROWING LOVE:

EUGÉNIE KISSED HER HAND SAYING:

“HOW GOOD YOU ARE DEAR MAMA!”

AT THESE WORDS THE MATERNAL OLD FACE WORN WITH LONG SUFFERING LIGHTS UP.

“DON’T YOU THINK HE’S NICE?” EUGÉNIE ASKED.

MME GRANDET ANSWERED ONLY BY A SMILE; THEN AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE SHE LOWERED HER VOICE AND SAID:

“COULD YOU LOVE HIM ALREADY? IT WOULD BE WRONG.”

“WRONG?” EUGÉNIE REPEATED. “WHY? YOU LIKE HIM NANON LIKES HIM WHY SHOULDN’T I LIKE HIM? NOW MAMA LET’S SET THE TABLE FOR HIS LUNCHEON.”

SHE DROPPED HER WORK HER MOTHER DID LIKEWISE SAYING:

“YOU ARE MAD.”

BUT SHE WANTED TO JUSTIFY HER DAUGHTER’S MADNESS BY SHARING IT.

EUGÉNIE CALLED NANON:

“WHAT DO YOU WANT MAM’SELLE?”

“YOU’LL HAVE CREAM FOR NOON NANON?”

“AH FOR NOON—YES” THE OLD SERVANT ANSWERED.

“WELL GIVE HIM HIS COFFEE VERY STRONG. I HEARD M. DES GRASSINS SAY THAT THEY MAKE COFFEE VERY STRONG IN PARIS. PUT IN A LOT.”

“WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT?”

“BUY SOME.”

“AND IF MONSIEUR SEES ME?”

“HE’S OUT IN THE FIELDS.”

MY NEIGHBOURS HAD BEEN SILENT EVER SINCE I HAD COME BUT SUDDENLY THE HUSBAND’S VOICE DISTRACTED ME FROM MY READING.

THE HUSBAND AMUSED AND MYSTERIOUS:

“SAY DID YOU SEE THAT?”

THE WOMAN GIVES A START AND LOOKS COMING OUT OF A DREAM. HE EATS AND DRINKS THEN STARTS AGAIN WITH THE SAME MALICIOUS AIR:

“HA HA!”

A MOMENT OF SILENCE THE WOMAN HAS FALLEN BACK INTO HER DREAM.

SUDDENLY SHE SHUDDERS AND ASKS:

“WHAT DID YOU SAY?”

“SUZANNE YESTERDAY.”

“AH YES” THE WOMAN SAYS “SHE WENT TO SEE VICTOR.”

“WHAT DID I TELL YOU?”

THE WOMAN PUSHES HER PLATE ASIDE IMPATIENTLY.

“IT’S NO GOOD.”

THE SIDE OF HER PLATE IS ADORNED WITH LUMPS OF GRISTLE SHE SPITS OUT. THE HUSBAND FOLLOWS HIS IDEA.

“THAT LITTLE WOMAN THERE . . .”

HE STOPS AND SMILES VAGUELY. ACROSS FROM US THE OLD STOCKBROKER IS STROKING MARIETTE’S ARM AND BREATHING HEAVILY. AFTER A MOMENT:

“I TOLD YOU SO THE OTHER DAY.”

“WHAT DID YOU TELL ME?”

“VICTOR—THAT SHE’D GO AND SEE HIM. WHAT’S THE MATTER?” HE ASKS BRUSQUELY WITH A FRIGHTENED LOOK “DON’T YOU LIKE THAT?”

“IT’S NO GOOD.”

“IT ISN’T THE SAME ANY MORE” HE SAYS WITH IMPORTANCE “IT ISN’T THE WAY IT WAS IN HÉCART’S TIME. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS HÉCART?”

“DOMREMY ISN’T HE?”

“YES WHO TOLD YOU?”

“YOU DID. YOU TOLD ME SUNDAY.”

SHE EATS A MORSEL OF CRUMB WHICH IS SCATTERED ON THE PAPER TABLECLOTH. THEN HER HAND SMOOTHING THE PAPER ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE WITH HESITATION:

“YOU KNOW YOU’RE MISTAKEN SUZANNE IS MORE . . .”

“THAT MAY WELL BE MY DEAR THAT MAY WELL BE” HE ANSWERS DISTRACTEDLY. HE TRIES TO CATCH MARIETTE’S EYES MAKES A SIGN TO HER.

“IT’S HOT.”

MARIETTE LEANS FAMILIARLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE.

“YES IT IS HOT” THE WOMAN SAYS SIGHING DEEPLY “IT’S STIFLING HERE AND BESIDES THE BEEF’S NO GOOD I’M GOING TO TELL THE MANAGER IT’S NOT THE WAY IT USED TO BE DO OPEN THE WINDOW A LITTLE MARIETTE.”

AMUSED THE HUSBAND CONTINUES:

“SAY DIDN’T YOU SEE HER EYES?”

“WHEN DARLING?”

HE APES HER IMPATIENTLY:

“WHEN DARLING! THAT’S YOU ALL OVER: IN SUMMER WHEN IT SNOWS.”

“AH! YOU MEAN YESTERDAY?”

HE LAUGHS LOOKS INTO THE DISTANCE AND RECITES QUICKLY WITH A CERTAIN APPLICATION:

“THE EYES OF A CAT ON LIVE COALS.”

HE IS SO PLEASED THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY.

SHE LAUGHS IN HER TURN WITHOUT MALICE:

“HA HA OLD DEVIL!”

SHE TAPS ON HIS SHOULDER.

“OLD DEVIL OLD DEVIL!”

HE REPEATS WITH ASSURANCE:

“THE EYES OF A CAT ON LIVE COALS!”

BUT SHE STOPS LAUGHING:

“NO SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW SHE’S REALLY RESPECTABLE.”

HE LEANS OVER WHISPERS A LONG STORY IN HER EAR. HER MOUTH HANGS OPEN FOR A MOMENT THE FACE A LITTLE DRAWN LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BURST OUT LAUGHING THEN SUDDENLY SHE THROWS HERSELF BACK AND CLAWS AT HIS HANDS.

“IT ISN’T TRUE IT ISN’T TRUE.”

HE SAYS IN A CONSIDERED WAY:

“LISTEN TO ME MY PET WILL YOU; SINCE HE SAID SO HIMSELF. IF IT WEREN’T TRUE WHY SHOULD HE HAVE SAID IT?”

“NO NO.”

“BUT HE SAID SO: LISTEN SUPPOSE . . .”

SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH:

“I’M LAUGHING BECAUSE I’M THINKING ABOUT RENÉ.”

“YES.”

HE LAUGHS TOO. SHE GOES ON IN A LOW EARNEST VOICE:

“SO HE NOTICED IT TUESDAY.”

“THURSDAY.”

“NO TUESDAY YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE . . .”

SHE SKETCHES A SORT OF ELLIPSIS IN THE AIR.

A LONG SILENCE. THE HUSBAND DIPS HIS BREAD IN THE GRAVY MARIETTE CHANGES THE PLATES AND BRINGS THEM TART. I TOO SHALL WANT A TART SUDDENLY THE WOMAN A LITTLE DREAMY WITH A PROUD AND SOMEWHAT SHOCKED SMILE ON HER LIPS SAYS IN A SLOW DRAGGING VOICE:

“OH NO NOW COME.”

THERE IS SO MUCH SENSUALITY IN HER VOICE THAT IT STIRS HIM: HE STROKES THE BACK OF HER NECK WITH HIS FAT HAND.

“CHARLES STOP YOU’RE GETTING ME EXCITED DARLING” SHE MURMURS SMILING HER MOUTH FULL.

I TRY TO GO BACK TO MY READING:

“WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT?”

“BUY SOME”

“AND IF MONSIEUR SEES ME?”

BUT I STILL HEAR THE WOMAN SHE SAYS:

“SAY I’M GOING TO MAKE MARTHE LAUGH I’M GOING TO TELL HER . . .”

MY NEIGHBOURS ARE SILENT. AFTER THE TART MARIETTE SERVES THEM PRUNES AND THE WOMAN IS BUSY GRACEFULLY LAYING STONES IN HER SPOON. THE HUSBAND STARING AT THE CEILING TAPS OUT A RHYTHM ON THE TABLE. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT SILENCE WAS THEIR NORMAL STATE AND SPEECH A FEVER THAT SOMETIMES TAKES THEM.

“WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT?”

“BUY SOME”

I CLOSE THE BOOK. I’M GOING OUT FOR A WALK.

IT WAS ALMOST THREE O’CLOCK WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE BRASSERIE VÉZELISE; I FELT THE AFTERNOON ALL THROUGH MY HEAVY BODY. NOT MY AFTERNOON BUT THEIRS THE ONE A HUNDRED THOUSAND BOUVILLOIS WERE GOING TO LIVE IN COMMON. AT THIS SAME TIME AFTER THE LONG AND COPIOUS SUNDAY MEAL THEY WERE GETTING UP FROM THE TABLE FOR THEM SOMETHING HAD DIED. SUNDAY HAD SPENT ITS FLEETING YOUTH. YOU HAD TO DIGEST THE CHICKEN AND THE TART GET DRESSED TO GO OUT.

THE BELL OF THE CINÉ-ELDORADO RESOUNDED IN THE CLEAR AIR. THIS IS A FAMILIAR SUNDAY NOISE THIS RINGING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. MORE THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LINED UP ALONG THE GREEN WALL. THEY WERE GREEDILY AWAITING THE HOUR OF SOFT SHADOWS OF RELAXATION ABANDON THE HOUR WHEN THE SCREEN GLOWING LIKE A WHITE STONE UNDER WATER WOULD SPEAK AND DREAM FOR THEM. VAIN DESIRE: SOMETHING WOULD STAY TAUT IN THEM: THEY WERE TOO AFRAID SOMEONE WOULD SPOIL THEIR LOVELY SUNDAY. SOON AS EVERY SUNDAY THEY WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED: THE FILM WOULD BE RIDICULOUS THEIR NEIGHBOUR WOULD BE SMOKING A PIPE AND SPITTING BETWEEN HIS KNEES OR ELSE LUCIEN WOULD BE DISAGREEABLE HE WOULDN’T HAVE A DECENT WORD TO SAY OR ELSE AS IF ON PURPOSE JUST FOR TODAY FOR THE ONE TIME THEY WENT TO THE MOVIES THEIR INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA WOULD START UP AGAIN. SOON AS ON EVERY SUNDAY SMALL MUTE RAGES WOULD GROW IN THE DARKENED HALL.

I FOLLOWED THE CALM RUE BRESSAN. THE SUN HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE CLOUDS IT WAS A FINE DAY. A FAMILY HAD JUST COME OUT OF A VILLA CALLED “THE WAVE.” THE DAUGHTER WAS BUTTONING HER GLOVES STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT THIRTY. THE MOTHER PLANTED ON THE FIRST STEP WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH AN ASSURED AIR BREATHING HEAVILY. I COULD ONLY SEE THE ENORMOUS BACK OF THE FATHER. BENT OVER THE KEYHOLE HE WAS CLOSING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT. THE HOUSE WOULD REMAIN BLACK AND EMPTY TILL THEY GOT BACK. IN THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSES ALREADY BOLTED AND DESERTED THE FLOOR AND FURNITURE CREAKED GENTLY. BEFORE GOING OUT THEY HAD PUT OUT THE FIRE IN THE DINING-ROOM FIREPLACE. THE FATHER REJOINS THE TWO WOMEN AND THE FAMILY WALKS AWAY WITHOUT A WORD. WHERE WERE THEY GOING? ON SUNDAY YOU GO TO THE MEMORIAL CEMETERY OR YOU VISIT YOUR PARENTS OR IF YOU’RE COMPLETELY FREE YOU GO FOR A WALK ALONG THE JETTY. I WAS FREE: I FOLLOWED THE RUE BRESSAN WHICH LEADS TO THE JETTY PROMENADE.

THE SKY WAS PALE BLUE: A FEW WISPS OF SMOKE AND FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEETING CLOUD PASSED IN FRONT OF THE SUN. IN THE DISTANCE I COULD SEE THE WHITE CEMENT BALUSTRADE WHICH RUNS ALONG THE JETTY PROMENADE; THE SEA GLITTERED THROUGH THE INTERSTICES. THE FAMILY TURNS RIGHT ON THE RUE DE L’AUMÔNIER-HILAIRE WHICH CLIMBS UP THE COTEAU VERT. I SAW THEM MOUNT SLOWLY MAKING THREE BLACK STAINS AGAINST THE SPARKLING ASPHALT. I TURNED LEFT AND JOINED THE CROWD STREAMING TOWARDS THE SEA.

THERE WAS MORE OF A MIXTURE THAN IN THE MORNING. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ALL THESE MEN NO LONGER HAD STRENGTH TO SUSTAIN THIS FINE SOCIAL HIERARCHY THEY WERE SO PROUD OF BEFORE LUNCHEON. BUSINESSMEN AND OFFICIALS WALKED SIDE BY SIDE; THEY LET THEMSELVES BE ELBOWED EVEN JOSTLED OUT OF THE WAY BY SHABBY EMPLOYEES. ARISTOCRATS ÉLITE AND PROFESSIONAL GROUPS HAD MELTED INTO THE WARM CROWD. ONLY SCATTERED MEN WERE LEFT WHO WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE.

A PUDDLE OF LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE—THE SEA AT LOW TIDE. ONLY A FEW REEFS BROKE THE CLEAR SURFACE. FISHING SMACKS LAY ON THE SAND NOT FAR FROM STICKY BLOCKS OF STONE WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN PELL-MELL AT THE FOOT OF THE JETTY TO PROTECT IT FROM THE WAVES AND THROUGH THE INTERSTICES THE SEA RUMBLED. AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE OUTER HARBOUR AGAINST THE SUN-BLEACHED SKY A DREDGE DEFINED ITS SHADOW. EVERY EVENING UNTIL MIDNIGHT IT HOWLS AND GROANS AND MAKES THE DEVIL OF A NOISE. BUT ON SUNDAY THE WORKERS ARE STROLLING OVER THE LAND THERE IS ONLY A WATCHMAN ON BOARD: THERE IS SILENCE.

THE SUN WAS CLEAR AND DIAPHANOUS LIKE WHITE WINE. ITS LIGHT BARELY TOUCHED THE MOVING FIGURES GAVE THEM NO SHADOW NO RELIEF: FACES AND HANDS MADE SPOTS OF PALE GOLD. ALL THESE MEN IN TOPCOATS SEEMED TO FLOAT IDLY A FEW INCHES ABOVE THE GROUND. FROM TIME TO TIME THE WIND CAST SHADOWS AGAINST US WHICH TREMBLED LIKE WATER; FACES WERE BLOTTED OUT FOR AN INSTANT CHALKY WHITE.

IT WAS SUNDAY; MASSED BETWEEN THE BALUSTRADE AND THE GATES OF RESIDENTS’ CHALETS THE CROWD DISPERSED SLOWLY FORMING ITSELF INTO A THOUSAND RIVULETS BEHIND THE “GRAND HÔTEL DE LA COMPAGNIE TRANSATLANTIQUE.” AND CHILDREN! CHILDREN IN CARRIAGES CHILDREN IN ARMS HELD BY THE HAND OR WALKING BY TWOS AND THREES IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS WITH A STIFF AND FORMAL LOOK. I HAD SEEN ALL THESE FACES A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE ALMOST TRIUMPHANT IN THE YOUTH OF A SUNDAY MORNING. NOW DRIPPING WITH SUNLIGHT THEY EXPRESSED NOTHING MORE THAN CALM RELAXATION AND A SORT OF OBSTINACY.

LITTLE MOVEMENT: THERE WAS STILL A LITTLE HAT-RAISING HERE AND THERE BUT WITHOUT THE EXPANSIVENESS THE NERVOUS GAIETY OF THE MORNING. THE PEOPLE ALL LET THEMSELVES LEAN BACK A LITTLE HEAD HIGH LOOKING INTO THE DISTANCE ABANDONED TO THE WIND WHICH SWEPT THEM AND SWELLED OUT THEIR COATS. FROM TIME TO TIME A SHORT LAUGH QUICKLY STIFLED THE CALL OF A MOTHER JEANNOT JEANNOT COME HERE. AND THEN SILENCE. A FAINT AROMA OF PALE TOBACCO: THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS ARE SMOKING IT. SALAMMBÔ AICHA; SUNDAY CIGARETTES. I THOUGHT I COULD DETECT SADNESS ON SOME OF THE MORE RELAXED FACES: BUT NO THESE PEOPLE WERE NEITHER SAD NOR GAY: THEY WERE AT REST. THEIR WIDE-OPEN STARING EYES PASSIVELY REFLECTED SEA AND SKY. THEY WOULD SOON GO BACK DRINK A CUP OF FAMILY TEA TOGETHER ROUND THE DINING-ROOM TABLE. FOR THE MOMENT THEY WANTED TO LIVE WITH THE LEAST EXPENDITURE ECONOMIZE WORDS GESTURES THOUGHTS FLOAT: THEY HAD ONLY ONE DAY IN WHICH TO SMOOTH OUT THEIR WRINKLES THEIR CROW’S FEET THE BITTER LINES MADE BY A HARD WEEK’S WORK. ONE DAY ONLY. THEY FELT THE MINUTES FLOWING BETWEEN THEIR FINGERS; WOULD THEY HAVE TIME TO STORE UP ENOUGH YOUTH TO START ANEW ON MONDAY MORNING? THEY FILLED THEIR LUNGS BECAUSE SEA AIR VIVIFIES: ONLY THEIR BREATHING DEEP AND REGULAR AS THAT OF SLEEPERS STILL TESTIFIED THAT THEY WERE ALIVE. I WALKED STEALTHILY I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HARD VIGOROUS BODY IN THE MIDST OF THIS TRAGIC RELAXED CROWD.

THE SEA WAS NOW THE COLOUR OF SLATE; IT WAS RISING SLOWLY. BY NIGHT IT WOULD BE HIGH; TONIGHT THE JETTY PROMENADE WOULD BE MORE DESERTED THAN THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR. IN FRONT AND ON THE LEFT A RED FIRE WOULD BURN IN THE CHANNEL.

THE SUN WENT DOWN SLOWLY OVER THE SEA. IN PASSING IT LIT UP THE WINDOW A NORMAN CHALET. A WOMAN DAZZLED BY IT WEARILY BROUGHT HER HAND TO HER EYES AND SHOOK HER HEAD.

“GASTON IT’S BLINDING ME” SHE SAYS WITH A LITTLE LAUGH.

“HEY THAT SUN’S ALL RIGHT” HER HUSBAND SAYS “IT DOESN’T KEEP YOU WARM BUT IT’S A PLEASURE TO WATCH IT.”

TURNING TO THE SEA SHE SPOKE AGAIN:

“I THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT.”

“NOT A CHANCE” THE MAN SAYS “IT’S IN THE SUN.”

THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ILE CAILLEBOTTE WHOSE SOUTHERN TIP COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN BETWEEN THE DREDGE AND THE QUAY OF THE OUTER-HARBOUR.

THE LIGHT GROWS SOFTER. AT THIS UNCERTAIN HOUR ONE FELT EVENING DRAWING IN. SUNDAY WAS ALREADY PAST. THE VILLAS AND GREY BALUSTRADE SEEMED ONLY YESTERDAY. ONE BY ONE THE FACES LOST THEIR LEISURED LOOK SEVERAL BECAME ALMOST TENDER.

A PREGNANT WOMAN LEANED AGAINST A FAIR BRUTAL-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.

“THERE THERE . . . THERE LOOK” SHE SAID.

“WHAT?”

“THERE . . . THERE . . . THE SEAGULLS.”

HE SHRUGGED: THERE WERE NO SEAGULLS. THE SKY HAD BECOME ALMOST PURE A LITTLE BLUSH ON THE HORIZON.

“I HEARD THEM. LISTEN THEY’RE CRYING. . . .”

HE ANSWERED:

“SOMETHING’S CREAKING THAT’S ALL.”

A GAS LAMP GLOWED. I THOUGHT THE LAMPLIGHTER HAD ALREADY PASSED. THE CHILDREN WATCH FOR HIM BECAUSE HE GIVES THE SIGNAL FOR THEM TO GO HOME. BUT IT WAS ONLY A LAST RAY OF THE SETTING SUN. THE SKY WAS STILL CLEAR BUT THE EARTH WAS BATHED IN SHADOW. THE CROWD WAS DISPERSING YOU COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR THE DEATH RATTLE OF THE SEA. A YOUNG WOMAN LEANING WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE BALUSTRADE RAISED HER BLUE FACE TOWARDS THE SKY BARRED IN BLACK BY LIP-STICK. FOR A MOMENT I WONDERED IF I WERE NOT GOING TO LOVE HUMANITY. BUT AFTER ALL IT WAS THEIR SUNDAY NOT MINE.

THE FIRST LIGHT TO GO ON WAS THAT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE ILE CAILLEBOTTE; A LITTLE BOY STOPPED NEAR ME AND MURMURED IN ECSTASY “OH THE LIGHTHOUSE!”

THEN I FELT MY HEART SWELL WITH A GREAT FEELING OF ADVENTURE.

IMAGE

I TURN LEFT AND THROUGH THE RUE DES VOILIERS REJOIN THE LITTLE PRADO. THE IRON SHUTTERS HAVE BEEN LOWERED ON ALL THE SHOP WINDOWS. THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE IS LIGHT BUT DESERTED IT HAS LOST ITS BRIEF GLORY OF THE MORNING; NOTHING DISTINGUISHES IT ANY LONGER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING STREETS. A FAIRLY STRONG WIND HAS COME UP. I HEAR THE ARCHBISHOP’S METAL HAT CREAKING.

I AM ALONE MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE GONE BACK HOME THEY ARE READING THE EVENING PAPER LISTENING TO THE RADIO. SUNDAY HAS LEFT THEM WITH A TASTE OF ASHES AND THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ALREADY TURNING TOWARDS MONDAY. BUT FOR ME THERE IS NEITHER MONDAY NOR SUNDAY: THERE ARE DAYS WHICH PASS IN DISORDER AND THEN SUDDEN LIGHTNING LIKE THIS ONE.

NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND YET EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT. I CAN’T DESCRIBE IT; IT’S LIKE THE NAUSEA AND YET IT’S JUST THE OPPOSITE: AT LAST AN ADVENTURE HAPPENS TO ME AND WHEN I QUESTION MYSELF I SEE THAT IT HAPPENS THAT I AM MYSELF AND THAT I AM HERE; I AM THE ONE WHO SPLITS THE NIGHT I AM AS HAPPY AS THE HERO OF A NOVEL.

SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN: SOMETHING IS WAITING FOR ME IN THE SHADOW OF THE RUE BASSE-DE-VIEILLE IT IS OVER THERE JUST AT THE CORNER OF THIS CALM STREET THAT MY LIFE IS GOING TO BEGIN. I SEE MYSELF ADVANCING WITH A SENSE OF FATALITY. THERE IS A SORT OF WHITE MILESTONE AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET. FROM FAR AWAY IT SEEMED BLACK AND AT EACH STRIDE IT TAKES ON A WHITER COLOUR. THIS DARK BODY WHICH GROWS LIGHTER LITTLE BY LITTLE MAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY IMPRESSION ON ME: WHEN IT BECOMES ENTIRELY CLEAR ENTIRELY WHITE I SHALL STOP JUST BESIDE IT AND THE ADVENTURE WILL BEGIN. IT IS SO CLOSE NOW THIS WHITE BEACON WHICH COMES OUT OF THE SHADOWS THAT I AM ALMOST AFRAID: FOR A MOMENT I THINK OF TURNING BACK. BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE SPELL. I ADVANCE I STRETCH OUT MY HAND AND TOUCH THE STONE.

HERE IS THE RUE BASSE-DE-VIEILLE AND THE ENORMOUS MASS OF SAINTE-CÉCILE CROUCHING IN THE SHADOW ITS WINDOWS GLOWING. THE METAL HAT CREAKS. I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE WHOLE WORLD HAS SUDDENLY SHRUNK OR WHETHER I AM THE ONE WHO UNIFIES ALL SOUNDS AND SHAPES: I CANNOT EVEN CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING AROUND ME BEING OTHER THAN WHAT IT IS.

I STOP FOR A MOMENT I WAIT I FEEL MY HEART BEATING; MY EYES SEARCH THE EMPTY SQUARE. I SEE NOTHING. A FAIRLY STRONG WIND HAS RISEN. I AM MISTAKEN. THE RUE BASSE-DE-VIEILLE WAS ONLY A STAGE: THE THING IS WAITING FOR ME AT THE END OF THE PLACE DUCOTON.

I AM IN NO HURRY TO START WALKING AGAIN. IT SEEMS AS IF I HAD TOUCHED THE GOAL OF MY HAPPINESS. IN MARSEILLES IN SHANGHAI MEKNES WHAT WOULDN’T I HAVE DONE TO ACHIEVE SUCH SATISFACTION? I EXPECT NOTHING MORE TODAY I’M GOING HOME AT THE END OF AN EMPTY SUNDAY: IT IS THERE.

I LEAVE AGAIN. THE WAIL OF A SIREN COMES TO ME ON THE WIND. I AM ALL ALONE BUT I MARCH LIKE A REGIMENT DESCENDING ON A CITY. AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE ARE SHIPS ON THE SEA RESOUNDING WITH MUSIC; LIGHTS ARE TURNED ON IN ALL THE CITIES OF EUROPE; COMMUNISTS AND NAZIS SHOOTING IT OUT IN THE STREETS OF BERLIN UNEMPLOYED POUNDING THE PAVEMENTS OF NEW YORK WOMEN AT THEIR DRESSING-TABLES IN A WARM ROOM PUTTING MASCARA ON THEIR EYELASHES. AND I AM HERE IN THIS DESERTED STREET AND EACH SHOT FROM A WINDOW IN NEUKÖLLN EACH HICCOUGH OF THE WOUNDED BEING CARRIED AWAY EACH PRECISE GESTURE OF WOMEN AT THEIR TOILET ANSWERS TO MY EVERY STEP MY EVERY HEARTBEAT.

I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO IN FRONT OF THE PASSAGE GILLET. ISN’T ANYONE WAITING FOR ME AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE? BUT THERE IS ALSO AT THE PLACE DUCOTON AT THE END OF THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE SOMETHING WHICH NEEDS ME IN ORDER TO COME TO LIFE. I AM FULL OF ANGUISH: THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT IRKS ME. I CAN’T IMAGINE WHAT THEY WANT WITH ME. YET I MUST CHOOSE: I SURRENDER THE PASSAGE GILLET I SHALL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR ME.

THE PLACE DUCOTON IS EMPTY. AM I MISTAKEN? I DON’T THINK I COULD STAND IT. WILL NOTHING REALLY HAPPEN? I GO TOWARDS THE LIGHTS OF THE CAFÉ MABLY. I AM LOST I DON’T KNOW WHETHER I’M GOING IN: I GLANCE THROUGH THE LARGE STEAMED WINDOWS.

THE PLACE IS FULL. THE AIR IS BLUE WITH CIGARETTE SMOKE AND STEAM RISING FROM DAMP CLOTHING. THE CASHIER IS AT HER COUNTER. I KNOW HER WELL: SHE’S RED HAIRED AS I AM; SHE HAS SOME SORT OF STOMACH TROUBLE. SHE IS ROTTING QUIETLY UNDER HER SKIRTS WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE LIKE THE ODOUR OF VIOLETS GIVEN OFF BY A DECOMPOSING BODY. A SHUDDER GOES THROUGH ME: SHE . . . SHE IS THE ONE WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME. SHE WAS THERE STANDING ERECT ABOVE THE COUNTER SMILING. FROM THE FAR END OF THE CAFÉ SOMETHING RETURNS WHICH HELPS TO LINK THE SCATTERED MOMENTS OF THAT SUNDAY AND SOLDER THEM TOGETHER AND WHICH GIVES THEM A MEANING. I HAVE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY ONLY TO END THERE WITH MY NOSE GLUED AGAINST THE WINDOW TO GAZE AT THIS DELICATE FACE BLOSSOMING AGAINST THE RED CURTAIN. ALL HAS STOPPED; MY LIFE HAS STOPPED: THIS WIDE WINDOW THIS HEAVY AIR BLUE AS WATER THIS FLESHY WHITE PLANT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER AND I MYSELF WE FORM A COMPLETE AND STATIC WHOLE: I AM HAPPY.

WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE BOULEVARD DE LA REDOUTE AGAIN NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT BITTER REGRET I SAID TO MYSELF: PERHAPS THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD I CLING TO AS MUCH AS THIS FEELING OF ADVENTURE; BUT IT COMES WHEN IT PLEASES; IT IS GONE SO QUICKLY AND HOW EMPTY I AM ONCE IT HAS LEFT. DOES IT IRONICALLY PAY ME THESE SHORT VISITS IN ORDER TO SHOW ME THAT I HAVE WASTED MY LIFE?

BEHIND ME IN THE TOWN ALONG THE GREAT STRAIGHT STREETS LIT UP BY THE COLD REFLECTION FROM THE LAMP POSTS A FORMIDABLE SOCIAL EVENT WAS DISSOLVING. SUNDAY WAS AT AN END.

MONDAY:

HOW COULD I HAVE WRITTEN THAT POMPOUS ABSURD SENTENCE YESTERDAY:

“I WAS ALONE BUT I MARCHED LIKE A REGIMENT DESCENDING ON A CITY.”

I DO NOT NEED TO MAKE PHRASES. I WRITE TO BRING CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO LIGHT. BEWARE OF LITERATURE. I MUST FOLLOW THE PEN WITHOUT LOOKING FOR WORDS.

AT HEART WHAT DISGUSTS ME IS HAVING BEEN SO SUBLIME LAST EVENING. WHEN I WAS TWENTY I USED TO GET DRUNK AND THEN EXPLAIN THAT I WAS A FELLOW IN THE STYLE OF DESCARTES. I KNEW I WAS INFLATING MYSELF WITH HEROISM BUT I LET MYSELF GO IT PLEASED ME. AFTER THAT THE NEXT MORNING I FELT AS SICK AS IF I HAD AWAKENED IN A BED FULL OF VOMIT. I NEVER VOMIT WHEN I’M DRUNK BUT THAT WOULD REALLY BE BETTER. YESTERDAY I DIDN’T EVEN HAVE THE EXCUSE OF DRUNKENNESS. I GOT EXCITED LIKE AN IMBECILE. I MUST WASH MYSELF CLEAN WITH ABSTRACT THOUGHTS TRANSPARENT AS WATER.

THIS FEELING OF ADVENTURE DEFINITELY DOES NOT COME FROM EVENTS: I HAVE PROVED IT. IT’S RATHER THE WAY IN WHICH THE MOMENTS ARE LINKED TOGETHER. I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS: YOU SUDDENLY FEEL THAT TIME IS PASSING THAT EACH INSTANT LEADS TO ANOTHER THIS ONE TO ANOTHER ONE AND SO ON; THAT EACH INSTANT IS ANNIHILATED AND THAT IT ISN’T WORTH WHILE TO HOLD IT BACK ETC. ETC. AND THEN YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS PROPERTY TO EVENTS WHICH APPEAR TO YOU IN THE INSTANTS; WHAT BELONGS TO THE FORM YOU CARRY OVER TO THE CONTENT. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS AMAZING FLOW OF TIME BUT YOU HARDLY SEE IT. YOU SEE A WOMAN YOU THINK THAT ONE DAY SHE’LL BE OLD ONLY YOU DON’T SEE HER GROW OLD. BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN YOU THINK YOU SEE HER GROW OLD AND FEEL YOURSELF GROWING OLD WITH HER: THIS IS THE FEELING OF ADVENTURE.

IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THEY CALL THAT THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF TIME. THE FEELING OF ADVENTURE WOULD SIMPLY BE THAT OF THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF TIME. BUT WHY DON’T WE ALWAYS HAVE IT? IS IT THAT TIME IS NOT ALWAYS IRREVERSIBLE? THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT GO FORWARD OR BACKWARD THAT IT HAS NO IMPORTANCE; AND THEN OTHER TIMES WHEN YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE LINKS HAVE BEEN TIGHTENED AND IN THAT CASE IT’S NOT A QUESTION OF MISSING YOUR TURN BECAUSE YOU COULD NEVER START AGAIN.

ANNY MADE THE MOST OF TIME. WHEN SHE WAS IN DJIBOUTI AND I WAS IN ADEN AND I USED TO GO AND SEE HER FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS SHE MANAGED TO MULTIPLY THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN US UNTIL THERE WERE ONLY EXACTLY SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE I HAD TO LEAVE; SIXTY MINUTES JUST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FEEL THE SECONDS PASSING ONE BY ONE. I REMEMBER ONE OF THOSE TERRIBLE EVENINGS. I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE AT MIDNIGHT. WE WENT TO AN OPEN-AIR MOVIE; WE WERE DESPERATE SHE AS MUCH AS I. ONLY SHE LED THE GAME. AT ELEVEN O’CLOCK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MAIN PICTURE SHE TOOK MY HAND AND HELD IT IN HERS WITHOUT A WORD. I WAS FLOODED WITH A BITTER JOY AND I UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT MY WATCH THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O’CLOCK. FROM THAT TIME ON WE BEGAN TO FEEL THE MINUTES PASSING. THAT TIME WE WERE LEAVING EACH OTHER FOR THREE MONTHS. AT ONE MOMENT THEY THREW A COMPLETELY BLANK IMAGE ON THE SCREEN THE DARKNESS LIFTED AND I SAW ANNY WAS CRYING. THEN AT MIDNIGHT SHE LET GO OF MY HAND AFTER PRESSING IT VIOLENTLY; I GOT UP AND LEFT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HER. THAT WAS A GOOD JOB.

7.00 P.M.

WORK TODAY. IT DIDN’T GO TOO BADLY; I WROTE SIX PAGES WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PLEASURE. THE MORE SO SINCE IT WAS A QUESTION OF ABSTRACT CONSIDERATIONS ON THE REIGN OF PAUL I. AFTER LAST EVENING’S ORGY I STAYED TIGHTLY BUTTONED UP ALL DAY. IT WOULD NOT DO TO APPEAL TO MY HEART! BUT I FELT QUITE AT EASE UNWINDING THE MAINSPRINGS OF THE RUSSIAN AUTOCRACY.

BUT THIS ROLLEBON ANNOYS ME. HE IS MYSTERIOUS IN THE SMALLEST THINGS. WHAT COULD HE HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE UKRAINE IN 1804? HE TELLS OF HIS TRIP IN VEILED WORDS:

“POSTERITY WILL JUDGE WHETHER MY EFFORTS WHICH NO SUCCESS COULD RECOMPENSE DID NOT MERIT SOMETHING BETTER THAN A BRUTAL DENIAL AND ALL THE HUMILIATIONS WHICH HAD TO BE BORNE IN SILENCE WHEN I HAD LOCKED IN MY BREAST THE WHEREWITHAL TO SILENCE THE SCOFFERS ONCE AND FOR ALL.”

I LET MYSELF BE CAUGHT ONCE: HE SHOWED HIMSELF FULL OF POMPOUS RETICENCE ON THE SUBJECT OF A SHORT TRIP HE TOOK TO BOUVILLE IN 1790. I LOST A MONTH VERIFYING HIS ASSERTIONS. FINALLY IT CAME OUT THAT HE HAD MADE THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF HIS TENANT FARMERS PREGNANT. CAN IT BE THAT HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LOW COMEDIAN?

I FEEL FULL OF ILL-WILL TOWARDS THIS LYING LITTLE FOP; PERHAPS IT IS SPITE: I WAS QUITE PLEASED THAT HE LIED TO OTHERS BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION OF ME; I THOUGHT WE WERE THICK AS THIEVES AND THAT HE WOULD FINALLY TELL ME THE TRUTH. HE TOLD ME NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL; NOTHING MORE THAN HE TOLD ALEXANDER OR LOUIS XVIII WHOM HE DUPED. IT MATTERS A LOT TO ME THAT ROLLEBON SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD FELLOW. UNDOUBTEDLY A RASCAL: WHO ISN’T? BUT A BIG OR LITTLE RASCAL? I DON’T HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH OPINION OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH TO LOSE MY TIME OVER A DEAD MAN WHOSE HAND IF HE WERE ALIVE I WOULD NOT DEIGN TO TOUCH. WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT HIM? YOU COULDN’T DREAM OF A BETTER LIFE THAN HIS: BUT DID HE LIVE IT? IF ONLY HIS LETTERS WEREN’T SO FORMAL. . . . AH I WISH I HAD KNOWN HIS LOOK PERHAPS HE HAD A CHARMING WAY OF LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER OR MISCHIEVOUSLY PLACING HIS LONG INDEX ON HIS NOSE OR SOMETIMES BETWEEN TWO POLISHED LIES HAVING A SUDDEN FIT OF VIOLENCE WHICH HE STIFLED IMMEDIATELY. BUT HE IS DEAD: ALL THAT IS LEFT OF HIM IS “A TREATISE ON STRATEGY” AND “REFLEXIONS ON VIRTUE.”

I COULD IMAGINE HIM SO WELL IF I LET MYSELF GO: BENEATH HIS BRILLIANT IRONY WHICH MADE SO MANY VICTIMS HE WAS SIMPLE ALMOST NAÏVE. HE THINKS LITTLE BUT AT ALL TIMES BY A PROFOUND INTUITION HE DOES EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. HIS RASCALITY IS CANDID SPONTANEOUS GENEROUS AS SINCERE AS HIS LOVE OF VIRTUE. AND WHEN HE BETRAYS HIS BENEFACTORS AND FRIENDS HE TURNS BACK GRAVELY TO THE EVENTS AND DRAWS A MORAL FROM THEM. HE NEVER THOUGHT HE HAD THE SLIGHTEST RIGHT OVER OTHERS ANY MORE THAN OTHERS OVER HIM: HE CONSIDERED AS UNJUSTIFIED AND GRATUITOUS THE GIFTS LIFE GAVE HIM. HE ATTACHED HIMSELF STRONGLY TO EVERYTHING BUT DETACHES HIMSELF EASILY. HE NEVER WROTE HIS OWN LETTERS OR HIS WORKS HIMSELF: BUT HAD THEM COMPOSED BY THE PUBLIC SCRIBE.

BUT IF THIS IS WHERE IT ALL LEADS ME I’D BE BETTER OFF WRITING A NOVEL ON THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON.

11.00 P.M.

I DINED AT THE RENDEZVOUS DES CHEMINOTS. THE PATRONNE WAS THERE AND I HAD TO KISS HER BUT IT WAS MAINLY OUT OF POLITENESS. SHE DISGUSTS ME A LITTLE SHE IS TOO WHITE AND BESIDES SHE SMELLS LIKE A NEWBORN CHILD. SHE PRESSED MY HEAD AGAINST HER BREAST IN A BURST OF PASSION: SHE THINKS IT IS THE RIGHT THING. I PLAYED DISTRACTEDLY WITH HER SEX UNDER THE COVER; THEN MY ARM WENT TO SLEEP. I THOUGHT ABOUT DE ROLLEBON: AFTER ALL WHY SHOULDN’T I WRITE A NOVEL ON HIS LIFE? I LET MY ARM RUN ALONG THE WOMAN’S THIGH AND SUDDENLY SAW A SMALL GARDEN WITH LOW WIDE TREES ON WHICH IMMENSE HAIRY LEAVES WERE HANGING. ANTS WERE RUNNING EVERYWHERE CENTIPEDES AND RINGWORM. THERE WERE EVEN MORE HORRIBLE ANIMALS: THEIR BODIES WERE MADE FROM A SLICE OF TOAST THE KIND YOU PUT UNDER ROAST PIGEONS; THEY WALKED SIDEWAYS WITH LEGS LIKE A CRAB. THE LARGER LEAVES WERE BLACK WITH BEASTS. BEHIND THE CACTUS AND THE BARBARY FIG TREES THE VELLEDA OF THE PUBLIC PARK POINTED A FINGER AT HER SEX. “THIS PARK SMELLS OF VOMIT” I SHOUTED.

“I DIDN’T WANT TO WAKE YOU UP” THE WOMAN SAID “BUT THE SHEET GOT FOLDED UNDER MY BACK AND BESIDES I HAVE TO GO DOWN AND LOOK AFTER THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE PARIS TRAIN.”

SHROVE TUESDAY:

I GAVE MAURICE BARRÈS A SPANKING. WE WERE THREE SOLDIERS AND ONE OF US HAD A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FACE. MAURICE BARRÈS CAME UP TO US AND SAID “THAT’S FINE!” AND HE GAVE EACH OF US A SMALL BOUQUET OF VIOLETS. “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO PUT THEM” SAID THE SOLDIER WITH THE HOLE IN HIS HEAD. THEN MAURICE BARRÉS SAID “PUT THEM IN THE HOLE YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD.” THE SOLDIER ANSWERED “I’M GOING TO STICK THEM UP YOUR ASS.” AND WE TURNED OVER MAURICE BARRÈS AND TOOK HIS PANTS OFF. HE HAD A CARDINAL’S RED ROBE ON UNDER HIS TROUSERS. WE LIFTED UP THE ROBE AND MAURICE BARRÈS BEGAN TO SHOUT: “LOOK OUT! I’VE GOT ON TROUSERS WITH FOOT-STRAPS.” BUT WE SPANKED HIM UNTIL HE BLED AND THEN WE TOOK THE PETALS OF VIOLETS AND DREW THE FACE OF DÉROULÈDE ON HIS BACKSIDE.

FOR SOME TIME NOW I HAVE BEEN REMEMBERING MY DREAMS MUCH TOO OFTEN. MOREOVER I MUST TOSS QUITE A BIT BECAUSE EVERY MORNING I FIND THE BLANKETS ON THE FLOOR. TODAY IS SHROVE TUESDAY BUT THAT MEANS VERY LITTLE IN BOUVILLE; IN THE WHOLE TOWN THERE ARE HARDLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE TO DRESS UP.

AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS THE LANDLADY CALLED ME:

“THERE’S A LETTER FOR YOU.”

A LETTER: THE LAST ONE I GOT WAS FROM THE CURATOR OF THE ROUEN PUBLIC LIBRARY LAST MAY. THE LANDLADY LEADS ME TO HER OFFICE AND HOLDS OUT A LONG THICK YELLOW ENVELOPE: ANNY HAD WRITTEN TO ME. I HADN’T HEARD FROM HER FOR FIVE YEARS. THE LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO MY OLD PARIS ADDRESS IT WAS POSTMARKED THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY.

I GO OUT; I HOLD THE ENVELOPE BETWEEN MY FINGERS I DARE NOT OPEN IT: ANNY HASN’T CHANGED HER LETTER PAPER I WONDER IF SHE STILL BUYS IT AT THE LITTLE STATIONER’S IN PICCADILLY. I THINK THAT SHE HAS ALSO KEPT HER COIFFURE HER HEAVY BLONDE LOCKS SHE DIDN’T WANT TO CUT. SHE MUST STRUGGLE PATIENTLY IN FRONT OF MIRRORS TO SAVE HER FACE: IT ISN’T VANITY OR FEAR OF GROWING OLD; SHE WANTS TO STAY AS SHE IS JUST AS SHE IS. PERHAPS THIS IS WHAT I LIKED BEST IN HER THIS AUSTERE LOYALTY TO HER MOST INSIGNIFICANT FEATURES.

THE FIRM LETTERS OF THE ADDRESS WRITTEN IN VIOLET INK (SHE HASN’T CHANGED HER INK EITHER) STILL SHINE A LITTLE:

“MONSIEUR ANTOINE ROQUENTIN”

HOW I LOVE TO READ MY NAME ON ENVELOPES. IN A MIST I HAVE RECAPTURED ONE OF HER SMILES I CAN SEE HER EYES HER INCLINED HEAD: WHENEVER I SAT DOWN SHE WOULD COME AND PLANT HERSELF IN FRONT OF ME SMILING. SHE STOOD HALF A HEAD HIGHER THAN I SHE GRASPED MY SHOULDERS AND SHOOK ME WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS.

THE ENVELOPE IS HEAVY IT MUST HAVE AT LEAST SIX PAGES IN IT. MY OLD CONCIERGE HAS SCRAWLED HIEROGLYPHICS OVER THIS LOVELY WRITING:

“HOTEL PRINTANIA—BOUVILLE”

THESE SMALL LETTERS DO NOT SHINE.

WHEN I OPEN THE LETTER MY DISILLUSION MAKES ME SIX YEARS YOUNGER:

I DON’T KNOW HOW ANNY MANAGES TO FILL UP HER ENVELOPES: THERE’S NEVER ANYTHING INSIDE.

THAT SENTENCE—I SAID IT A HUNDRED TIMES DURING THE SPRING OF 1924 STRUGGLING AS TODAY TO EXTRACT A PIECE OF PAPER FOLDED IN FOUR FROM ITS LINING. THE LINING IS A SPLENDOUR: DARK GREEN WITH GOLD STARS; YOU’D THINK IT WAS A HEAVY PIECE OF STARCHED CLOTH. IT ALONE MAKES THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ENVELOPE’S WEIGHT.

ANNY HAD WRITTEN IN PENCIL:

“I AM PASSING THROUGH PARIS IN A FEW DAYS. COME AND SEE ME AT THE HOTEL D’ESPAGNE ON FEBRUARY 20. PLEASE! (SHE HAD ADDED ‘I BEG YOU’ ABOVE THE LINE AND JOINED IT TO ‘TO SEE ME’ IN A CURIOUS SPIRAL). I MUST SEE YOU. ANNY.”

IN MEKNES IN TANGIERS WHEN I WENT BACK IN THE EVENING I SOMETIMES USED TO FIND A NOTE ON MY BED: “I WANT TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.” I USED TO RUN ANNY WOULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME HER EYEBROWS RAISED LOOKING SURPRISED. SHE HAD NOTHING MORE TO TELL ME; SHE WAS EVEN A LITTLE IRRITATED THAT I HAD COME. I’LL GO; SHE MAY REFUSE TO SEE ME. OR THEY MAY TELL ME AT THE DESK: “NO ONE BY THAT NAME IS STOPPING HERE.” I DON’T BELIEVE SHE’D DO THAT. ONLY SHE COULD WRITE ME A WEEK FROM NOW AND TELL ME SHE’S CHANGED HER MIND AND TO MAKE IT SOME OTHER TIME.

PEOPLE ARE AT WORK. THIS IS A FLAT AND STALE SHROVE TUESDAY. THE RUE DES MUTILÉS SMELLS STRONGLY OF DAMP WOOD AS IT DOES EVERY TIME IT’S GOING TO RAIN. I DON’T LIKE THESE QUEER DAYS: THE MOVIES HAVE MATINÉES THE SCHOOL CHILDREN HAVE A VACATION; THERE IS A VAGUE FEELING OF HOLIDAY IN THE AIR WHICH NEVER CEASES TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BUT DISAPPEARS AS SOON AS YOU NOTICE IT.

I AM UNDOUBTEDLY GOING TO SEE ANNY BUT I CAN’T SAY THAT THE IDEA MAKES ME EXACTLY JOYOUS. I HAVE FELT DÉSOEUVRÉ EVER SINCE I GOT HER LETTER. LUCKILY IT IS NOON; I’M NOT HUNGRY BUT I’M GOING TO EAT TO PASS THE TIME. I GO TO CAMILLE’S IN THE RUE DES HORLOGERS.

IT’S A QUIET PLACE; THEY SERVE SAUERKRAUT OR CASSOULET ALL NIGHT. PEOPLE GO THERE FOR SUPPER AFTER THE THEATRE; POLICEMEN SEND TRAVELLERS THERE WHO ARRIVE LATE AT NIGHT AND ARE HUNGRY. EIGHT MARBLE TABLES. A LEATHER BENCH RUNS ALONG THE WALLS. TWO MIRRORS EATEN AWAY BY RUST SPOTS. THE PANES OF THE TWO WINDOWS AND THE DOOR ARE FROSTED GLASS. THE COUNTER IS IN A RECESS IN THE BACK. THERE IS ALSO A ROOM ON THE SIDE. BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN IT; IT IS RESERVED FOR COUPLES.

“GIVE ME A HAM OMELET.”

THE WAITRESS AN ENORMOUS GIRL WITH RED CHEEKS CAN NEVER KEEP HERSELF FROM GIGGLING WHEN SHE SPEAKS TO A MAN.

“I’M AFRAID I CAN’T. DO YOU WANT A POTATO OMELET? THE HAM’S LOCKED UP: THE PATRON IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CUTS IT.”

I ORDER A CASSOULET. THE PATRON’S NAME IS CAMILLE A HARD MAN.

THE WAITRESS GOES OFF. I AM ALONE IN THIS DARK OLD ROOM. THERE IS A LETTER FROM ANNY IN MY DESPATCH CASE. A FALSE SHAME KEEPS ME FROM READING IT AGAIN. I TRY TO REMEMBER THE PHRASES ONE BY ONE.

“MY DEAR ANTOINE——”

I SMILE: CERTAINLY NOT ANNY CERTAINLY DID NOT WRITE “MY DEAR ANTOINE.”

SIX YEARS AGO—WE HAD JUST SEPARATED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT—I DECIDED TO LEAVE FOR TOKYO. I WROTE HER A FEW WORDS. I COULD NO LONGER CALL HER “MY DEAR LOVE”; IN ALL INNOCENCE I BEGAN “MY DEAR ANNY.”

“I ADMIRE YOUR CHEEK” SHE ANSWERED “I HAVE NEVER BEEN AND AM NOT YOUR DEAR ANNY. AND I MUST ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE NOT MY DEAR ANTOINE. IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT TO CALL ME DON’T CALL ME ANYTHING IT’S BETTER THAT WAY.”

I TAKE HER LETTER FROM MY DESPATCH CASE. SHE DID NOT WRITE “MY DEAR ANTOINE.” NOR WAS THERE ANYTHING FURTHER AT THE END OF THE LETTER: “I MUST SEE YOU. ANNY.” NOTHING THAT COULD GIVE ME ANY INDICATION OF HER FEELINGS. I CAN’T COMPLAIN: I RECOGNIZE HER LOVE OF PERFECTION THERE. SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE “PERFECT MOMENTS.” IF THE TIME WAS NOT CONVENIENT SHE TOOK NO MORE INTEREST IN ANYTHING HER EYES BECAME LIFELESS SHE DRAGGED ALONG LAZILY LIKE A GREAT AWKWARD GIRL. OR ELSE SHE WOULD PICK A QUARREL WITH ME:

“YOU BLOW YOUR NOSE SOLEMNLY LIKE A BOURGEOIS AND YOU COUGH VERY CAREFULLY IN YOUR HANDKERCHIEF.”

IT WAS BETTER NOT TO ANSWER JUST WAIT: SUDDENLY AT SOME SIGNAL WHICH ESCAPES ME NOW SHE SHUDDERED HER FINE LANGUISHING FEATURES HARDENED AND SHE BEGAN HER ANT’S WORK. SHE HAD AN IMPERIOUS AND CHARMING MAGIC; SHE HUMMED BETWEEN HER TEETH LOOKING ALL AROUND THEN STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP SMILING CAME TO SHAKE ME BY THE SHOULDERS AND FOR A FEW INSTANTS SEEMED TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE OBJECTS THAT SURROUNDED HER. SHE EXPLAINED TO ME IN A LOW RAPID VOICE WHAT SHE EXPECTED OF ME.

“LISTEN DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN EFFORT OR DON’T YOU? YOU WERE SO STUPID THE LAST TIME. DON’T YOU SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS MOMENT COULD BE? LOOK AT THE SKY LOOK AT THE COLOUR OF THE SUN ON THE CARPET. I’VE GOT MY GREEN DRESS ON AND MY FACE ISN’T MADE UP I’M QUITE PALE. GO BACK GO AND SIT IN THE SHADOW; YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO? COME ON! HOW STUPID YOU ARE! SPEAK TO ME!”

I FELT THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE WAS IN MY HANDS: THE MOMENT HAD AN OBSCURE MEANING WHICH HAD TO BE TRIMMED AND PERFECTED; CERTAIN MOTIONS HAD TO BE MADE CERTAIN WORDS SPOKEN: I STAGGERED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MY RESPONSIBILITY. I STARED AND SAW NOTHING I STRUGGLED IN THE MIDST OF RITES WHICH ANNY INVENTED ON THE SPOT AND TORE THEM TO SHREDS WITH MY STRONG ARMS. AT THOSE TIMES SHE HATED ME.

CERTAINLY I WOULD GO TO SEE HER. I STILL RESPECT AND LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS HAD BETTER LUCK AND SKILL IN THE GAME OF PERFECT MOMENTS.

“YOUR DAMNED HAIR SPOILS EVERYTHING” SHE SAID. “WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A RED-HEAD?”

SHE SMILED. FIRST I LOST THE MEMORY OF HER EYES THEN THE MEMORY OF HER LONG BODY. I KEPT HER SMILE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND THEN FINALLY LOST THAT THREE YEARS AGO. JUST NOW BRUSQUELY AS I WAS TAKING THE LETTER FROM THE LANDLADY’S HANDS IT CAME BACK TO ME; I THOUGHT I SAW ANNY SMILING. I TRY TO REFRESH MY MEMORY: I NEED TO FEEL ALL THE TENDERNES THAT ANNY INSPIRES; IT IS THERE THIS TENDERNESS IT IS NEAR ME ONLY ASKING TO BE BORN. BUT THE SMILE DOES NOT RETURN: IT IS FINISHED. I REMAIN DRY AND EMPTY.

A MAN COMES IN SHIVERING.

“MESSIEURS DAMES BONJOUR.”

HE SITS DOWN WITHOUT TAKING OFF HIS GREENISH OVERCOAT. HE RUBS HIS LONG HANDS CLASPING AND UNCLASPING HIS FINGERS.

“WHAT WILL YOU HAVE?”

HE GIVES A START HIS EYES LOOK WORRIED:

“EH? GIVE ME A BYRRH AND WATER.”

THE WAITRESS DOES NOT MOVE. IN THE GLASS HER FACE SEEMS TO SLEEP. HER EYES ARE INDEED OPEN BUT THEY ARE ONLY SLITS. THAT’S THE WAY SHE IS SHE IS NEVER IN A HURRY TO WAIT ON CUSTOMERS SHE ALWAYS TAKES A MOMENT TO DREAM OVER THEIR ORDERS. SHE MUST ALLOW HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF IMAGINING: I BELIEVE SHE’S THINKING ABOUT THE BOTTLE SHE’S GOING TO TAKE FROM ABOVE THE COUNTER THE WHITE LABEL AND RED LETTERS THE THICK BLACK SYRUP SHE IS GOING TO POUR OUT: IT’S A LITTLE AS THOUGH SHE WERE DRINKING IT HERSELF.

I SLIP ANNY’S LETTER BACK INTO MY DESPATCH CASE: SHE HAS DONE WHAT SHE COULD; I CANNOT REACH THE WOMAN WHO TOOK IT IN HER HANDS FOLDED AND PUT IT IN THE ENVELOPE. IS IT POSSIBLE EVEN TO THINK OF SOMEONE IN THE PAST? AS LONG AS WE LOVED EACH OTHER WE NEVER ALLOWED THE MEANEST OF OUR INSTANTS THE SMALLEST GRIEF TO BE DETACHED AND FORGOTTEN LEFT BEHIND. SOUNDS SMELLS NUANCES OF LIGHT EVEN THE THOUGHTS WE NEVER TOLD EACH OTHER; WE CARRIED THEM ALL AWAY AND THEY REMAINED ALIVE: EVEN NOW THEY HAVE THE POWER TO GIVE US JOY AND PAIN. NOT A MEMORY: AN IMPLACABLE TORRID LOVE WITHOUT SHADOW WITHOUT ESCAPE WITHOUT SHELTER. THREE YEARS ROLLED INTO ONE. THAT IS WHY WE PARTED: WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO BEAR THIS BURDEN. AND THEN WHEN ANNY LEFT ME ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL AT ONCE THE THREE YEARS CRUMBLED INTO THE PAST. I DIDN’T EVEN SUFFER I FELT EMPTIED OUT. THEN TIME BEGAN TO FLOW AGAIN AND THE EMPTINESS GREW LARGER. THEN IN SAIGON WHEN I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO FRANCE ALL THAT WAS STILL LEFT—STRANGE FACES PLACES QUAYS ON THE BANKS OF LONG RIVERS—ALL WAS WIPED OUT. NOW MY PAST IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENORMOUS VACUUM. MY PRESENT: THIS WAITRESS IN THE BLACK BLOUSE DREAMING NEAR THE COUNTER THIS MAN. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I HAVE LEARNED ALL I KNOW OF LIFE IN BOOKS. THE PALACES OF BENARES THE TERRACE OF THE LEPER KING THE TEMPLES OF JAVA WITH THEIR GREAT BROKEN STEPS ARE REFLECTED IN MY EYES FOR AN INSTANT BUT THEY HAVE REMAINED THERE ON THE SPOT. THE TRAMWAY THAT PASSES IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL PRINTANIA IN THE EVENING DOES NOT CATCH THE REFLECTION OF THE NEON SIGN-BOARD; IT FLAMES UP FOR AN INSTANT THEN GOES ON WITH BLACK WINDOWS.

THIS LITTLE MAN HAS NOT STOPPED LOOKING AT ME: HE BOTHERS ME. HE TRIES TO GIVE HIMSELF IMPORTANCE. THE WAITRESS HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO SERVE HIM. SHE RAISES HER GREAT BLACK ARM LAZILY REACHES THE BOTTLE AND BRINGS IT TO HIM WITH A GLASS.

“HERE YOU ARE MONSIEUR.”

“MONSIEUR ACHILLE” HE SAYS WITH URBANITY.

SHE POURS WITHOUT ANSWERING; ALL OF A SUDDEN HE TAKES HIS FINGER FROM HIS NOSE PLACES BOTH HANDS FLAT ON THE TABLE. HE THROWS HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES SHINE. HE SAYS IN A COLD VOICE:

“POOR GIRL.”

THE WAITRESS GIVES A START AND I START TOO: HE HAS AN INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION PERHAPS ONE OF AMAZEMENT AS IF IT WERE SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAD SPOKEN. ALL THREE OF US ARE UNCOMFORTABLE.

THE FAT WAITRESS RECOVERS FIRST: SHE HAS NO IMAGINATION. SHE MEASURES M. ACHILLE WITH DIGNITY: SHE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT ONE HAND ALONE WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEAR HIM FROM HIS SEAT AND THROW HIM OUT.

“AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I’M A POOR GIRL?”

HE HESITATES. HE LOOKS TAKEN ABACK THEN HE LAUGHS. HIS FACE CRUMPLES UP INTO A THOUSAND WRINKLES HE MAKES VAGUE GESTURES WITH HIS WRIST.

“SHE’S ANNOYED. IT WAS JUST TO SAY SOMETHING: I DIDN’T MEAN TO OFFEND.”

BUT SHE TURNS HER BACK ON HIM AND GOES BEHIND THE COUNTER: SHE IS REALLY OFFENDED. HE LAUGHS AGAIN:

“HA HA! YOU KNOW THAT JUST SLIPPED OUT. ARE YOU CROSS? SHE’S CROSS WITH ME” HE SAYS ADDRESSING HIMSELF VAGUELY TO ME.

I TURN MY HEAD AWAY. HE RAISES HIS GLASS A LITTLE BUT HE IS NOT THINKING ABOUT DRINKING: HE BLINKS HIS EYES LOOKING SURPRISED AND INTIMIDATED; HE LOOKS AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING. THE WAITRESS IS SITTING AT THE COUNTER; SHE PICKS UP HER SEWING. EVERYTHING IS SILENT AGAIN: BUT IT ISN’T THE SAME SILENCE. IT’S RAINING: TAPPING LIGHTLY AGAINST THE FROSTED GLASS WINDOWS; IF THERE ARE ANY MORE MASKED CHILDREN IN THE STREET THE RAIN IS GOING TO SPOIL THEIR CARDBOARD MASKS.

THE WAITRESS TURNS ON THE LIGHTS: IT IS HARDLY TWO O’CLOCK BUT THE SKY IS ALL BLACK SHE CAN’T SEE TO SEW. SOFT GLOW: PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR HOUSES THEY HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY TURNED ON THE LIGHTS TOO. THEY READ THEY WATCH THE SKY FROM THE WINDOW. FOR THEM IT MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEY HAVE AGED DIFFERENTLY. THEY LIVE IN THE MIDST OF LEGACIES GIFTS EACH PIECE OF FURNITURE HOLDS A MEMORY. CLOCKS MEDALLIONS PORTRAITS SHELLS PAPERWEIGHTS SCREENS SHAWLS. THEY HAVE CLOSETS FULL OF BOTTLES STUFFS OLD CLOTHES NEWSPAPERS; THEY HAVE KEPT EVERYTHING. THE PAST IS A LANDLORD’S LUXURY.

WHERE SHALL I KEEP MINE? YOU DON’T PUT YOUR PAST IN YOUR POCKET; YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HOUSE. I HAVE ONLY MY BODY: A MAN ENTIRELY ALONE WITH HIS LONELY BODY CANNOT INDULGE IN MEMORIES; THEY PASS THROUGH HIM. I SHOULDN’T COMPLAIN: ALL I WANTED WAS TO BE FREE.

THE LITTLE MAN STIRS AND SIGHS. HE IS ALL WRAPPED IN HIS OVERCOAT BUT FROM TIME TO TIME HE STRAIGHTENS UP AND PUTS ON A HAUGHTY LOOK. HE HAS NO PAST EITHER. LOOKING CLOSELY YOU WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY FIND IN A COUSIN’S HOUSE A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING HIM AT A WEDDING WITH A WING COLLAR STIFF SHIRT AND A SLIGHT YOUNG MAN’S MOUSTACHE. OF MYSELF I DON’T THINK THAT EVEN THAT IS LEFT.

HERE HE IS LOOKING AT ME AGAIN. THIS TIME HE’S GOING TO SPEAK TO ME AND I FEEL ALL TAUT INSIDE. THERE IS NO SYMPATHY BETWEEN US: WE ARE ALIKE THAT’S ALL. HE IS ALONE AS I AM BUT MORE SUNKEN INTO SOLITUDE THAN I. HE MUST BE WAITING FOR HIS OWN NAUSEA OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT. NOW THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO RECOGNIZE ME WHO SEE ME AND THINK: “HE’S ONE OF US.” SO? WHAT DOES HE WANT? HE MUST KNOW THAT WE CAN DO NOTHING FOR ONE ANOTHER. THE FAMILIES ARE IN THEIR HOUSES IN THE MIDST OF THEIR MEMORIES. AND HERE WE ARE TWO WANDERERS WITHOUT MEMORY. IF HE WERE SUDDENLY TO STAND UP AND SPEAK TO ME I’D JUMP INTO THE AIR.

THE DOOR OPENS WITH A GREAT TO-DO: IT IS DOCTOR ROGÉ.

“GOOD DAY EVERYBODY.”

HE COMES IN FEROCIOUS AND SUSPICIOUS SWAYING SWAYING A LITTLE ON HIS LONG LEGS WHICH CAN BARELY SUPPORT HIS BODY. I SEE HIM OFTEN ON SUNDAYS AT THE BRASSERIE VÉZELISE BUT HE DOESN’T KNOW ME. HE IS BUILT LIKE THE OLD MONITORS AT JOINVILLE ARMS LIKE THIGHS A CHEST MEASUREMENT OF 110 AND HE CAN’T STAND UP STRAIGHT.

“JEANNE MY LITTLE JEANNE.”

HE TROTS OVER TO THE COAT RACK TO HANG UP HIS WIDE FELT HAT ON THE PEG. THE WAITRESS HAS PUT AWAY HER SEWING AND COMES WITHOUT HURRYING SLEEP WALKING TO HELP THE DOCTOR OUT OF HIS RAINCOAT.

“WHAT WILL YOU HAVE DOCTOR?”

HE STUDIES HER GRAVELY. THAT’S WHAT I CALL A HANDSOME MASCULINE FACE. WORN FURROWED BY LIFE AND PASSIONS. BUT THE DOCTOR HAS UNDERSTOOD LIFE MASTERED HIS PASSIONS.

“I REALLY DON’T KNOW WHAT I WANT” HE SAYS IN A DEEP VOICE.

HE HAS DROPPED ONTO THE BENCH OPPOSITE ME; HE WIPES HIS FOREHEAD. HE FEELS AT EASE AS SOON AS HE GETS OFF HIS FEET. HIS GREAT EYES BLACK AND IMPERIOUS ARE INTIMIDATING.

“I’LL HAVE . . . I’LL HAVE . . . OH CALVADOS. . . .”

THE WAITRESS WITHOUT MAKING A MOVE STUDIES THIS ENORMOUS PITTED FACE. SHE IS DREAMY. THE LITTLE MAN RAISES HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE OF RELIEF. AND IT IS TRUE: THIS COLOSSUS HAS FREED US. SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS GOING TO CATCH US. I BREATHE FREELY: WE ARE AMONG MEN NOW.

“WELL IS THAT CALVADOS COMING?”

THE WAITRESS GIVES A START AND LEAVES. HE HAS STRETCHED OUT HIS STOUT ARMS AND GRASPED THE TABLE AT BOTH ENDS. M. ACHILLE IS JOYFUL; HE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR’S EYE. BUT HE SWINGS HIS LEGS AND SHIFTS ABOUT ON THE BENCH IN VAIN HE IS SO THIN THAT HE MAKES NO NOISE.

THE WAITRESS BRINGS THE CALVADOS. WITH A NOD OF HER HEAD SHE POINTS OUT THE LITTLE MAN TO THE DOCTOR. DOCTOR ROGÉ SLOWLY TURNS: HE CAN’T MOVE HIS NECK.

“SO IT’S YOU YOU OLD SWINE” HE SHOUTS “AREN’T YOU DEAD YET?”

HE ADDRESSES THE WAITRESS:

“YOU LET PEOPLE LIKE THAT IN HERE?”

HE STARES AT THE LITTLE MAN FEROCIOUSLY. A DIRECT LOOK WHICH PUTS EVERYTHING IN PLACE. HE EXPLAINS:

“HE’S CRAZY AS A LOON THAT’S THAT.”

HE DOESN’T EVEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LET ON THAT HE’S JOKING. HE KNOWS THAT THE LOONY WON’T BE ANGRY THAT HE’S GOING TO SMILE. AND THERE IT IS: THE MAN SMILES WITH HUMILITY. A CRAZY LOON: HE RELAXES HE FEELS PROTECTED AGAINST HIMSELF: NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HIM TODAY. I AM REASSURED TOO. A CRAZY OLD LOON: SO THAT WAS IT SO THAT WAS ALL.

THE DOCTOR LAUGHS HE GIVES ME AN ENGAGING CONSPIRATORIAL GLANCE: BECAUSE OF MY SIZE UNDOUBTEDLY—AND BESIDES I HAVE A CLEAN SHIRT ON—HE WANTS TO LET ME IN ON HIS JOKE.

I DO NOT LAUGH I DO NOT RESPOND TO HIS ADVANCES: THEN WITHOUT STOPPING TO LAUGH HE TURNS THE TERRIBLE FIRE OF HIS EYES ON ME. WE LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS: HE SIZES ME UP LOOKING AT ME WITH HALF-CLOSED EYES UP AND DOWN HE PLACES ME. IN THE CRAZY LOON CATEGORY? IN THE TRAMP CATEGORY?

STILL HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNS HIS FACE AWAY: ALLOWS HIMSELF TO DEFLATE BEFORE ONE LONE WRETCH WITHOUT SOCIAL IMPORTANCE IT ISN’T WORTH TALKING ABOUT—YOU CAN FORGET IT RIGHT AWAY. HE ROLLS A CIGARETTE AND LIGHTS IT THEN STAYS MOTIONLESS WITH HIS EYES HARD AND STARING LIKE AN OLD MAN’S.

THE FINE WRINKLES; HE HAS ALL OF THEM: HORIZONTAL ONES RUNNING ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD CROW’S FEET BITTER LINES AT EACH CORNER OF THE MOUTH WITHOUT COUNTING THE YELLOW CORDS DEPENDING FROM HIS CHIN. THERE’S A LUCKY MAN: AS SOON AS YOU PERCEIVE HIM YOU CAN TELL HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED THAT HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED. HE DESERVES HIS FACE FOR HE HAS NEVER FOR ONE INSTANT LOST AN OCCASION OF UTILIZING HIS PAST TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY: HE HAS STUFFED IT FULL USED HIS EXPERIENCE ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN EXPLOITED THEM.

M. ACHILLE IS PROBABLY HAPPIER THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN. HE IS AGAPE WITH ADMIRATION; HE DRINKS HIS BYRRH IN SMALL MOUTHFULS AND SWELLS HIS CHEEKS OUT WITH IT. THE DOCTOR KNEW HOW TO TAKE HIM! THE DOCTOR WASN’T THE ONE TO LET HIMSELF BE HYPNOTIZED BY AN OLD MADMAN ON THE VERGE OF HAVING HIS FIT; ONE GOOD BLOW A FEW ROUGH LASHING WORDS THAT’S WHAT THEY NEED. THE DOCTOR HAS EXPERIENCE. HE IS A PROFESSIONAL IN EXPERIENCE: DOCTORS PRIESTS MAGISTRATES AND ARMY OFFICERS KNOW MEN THROUGH AND THROUGH AS IF THEY HAD MADE THEM.

I AM ASHAMED FOR M. ACHILLE. WE ARE ON THE SAME SIDE WE SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST THEM. BUT HE LEFT ME HE WENT OVER TO THEIRS: HE HONESTLY BELIEVES IN EXPERIENCE. NOT IN HIS NOT IN MINE. IN DOCTOR ROGÉ’S. A LITTLE WHILE AGO M. ACHILLE FELT QUEER HE FELT LONELY: NOW HE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE HIM MANY OTHERS: DOCTOR ROGÉ HAS MET THEM HE COULD TELL M. ACHILLE THE CASE HISTORY OF EACH ONE OF THEM AND TELL HIM HOW THEY ENDED UP. M. ACHILLE IS SIMPLY A CASE AND LETS HIMSELF BE BROUGHT BACK EASILY TO THE ACCEPTED IDEAS.

HOW I WOULD LIKE TO TELL HIM HE’S BEING DECEIVED THAT HE IS THE BUTT OF THE IMPORTANT. EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS? THEY HAVE DRAGGED OUT THEIR LIFE IN STUPOR AND SEMI-SLEEP THEY HAVE MARRIED HASTILY OUT OF IMPATIENCE THEY HAVE MADE CHILDREN AT RANDOM. THEY HAVE MET OTHER MEN IN CAFÉS AT WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS. SOMETIMES CAUGHT IN THE TIDE THEY HAVE STRUGGLED AGAINST IT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM. ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED AROUND THEM HAS ELUDED THEM; LONG OBSCURE SHAPES EVENTS FROM AFAR BRUSHED BY THEM RAPIDLY AND WHEN THEY TURNED TO LOOK ALL HAD VANISHED. AND THEN AROUND FORTY THEY CHRISTEN THEIR SMALL OBSTINACIES AND A FEW PROVERBS WITH THE NAME OF EXPERIENCE THEY BEGIN TO SIMULATE SLOT MACHINES: PUT A COIN IN THE LEFT HAND SLOT AND YOU GET TALES WRAPPED IN SILVER PAPER PUT A COIN IN THE SLOT ON THE RIGHT AND YOU GET PRECIOUS BITS OF ADVICE THAT STICK TO YOUR TEETH LIKE CARAMELS. AS FAR AS THAT GOES I TOO COULD HAVE MYSELF INVITED TO PEOPLE’S HOUSES AND THEY’D SAY AMONG THEMSELVES THAT I WAS A “GRAND VOYAGEUR DEVANT L’ETERNEL.” YES: THE MOHAMEDANS SQUAT TO PASS WATER; INSTEAD OF ERGOT HINDU MIDWIVES USE GROUND GLASS IN COW DUNG; IN BORNEO WHEN A WOMAN HAS HER PERIOD SHE SPENDS THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS ON THE ROOF OF HER HOUSE. IN VENICE I SAW BURIALS IN GONDOLAS HOLY WEEK FESTIVALS IN SEVILLE I SAW THE PASSION PLAY AT OBERAMMERGAU. NATURALLY THAT’S JUST A SMALL SAMPLE OF ALL I KNOW: I COULD LEAN BACK IN A CHAIR AND BEGIN AMUSEMENT:

“DO YOU KNOW JIHLAVA MADAME? IT’S A CURIOUS LITTLE TOWN IN MORAVIA WHERE I STAYED IN 1924.”

AND THE JUDGE WHO HAS SEEN SO MANY CASES WOULD ADD AT THE END OF MY STORY:

“HOW TRUE IT IS MONSIEUR HOW HUMAN IT IS. I HAD A CASE JUST LIKE THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER. IT WAS IN 1902. I WAS DEPUTY JUDGE IN LIMOGES . . .”

BUT I WAS BOTHERED TOO MUCH BY THAT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. YET I DIDN’T BELONG TO A PROFESSIONAL FAMILY. THERE ARE ALSO AMATEURS. THESE ARE SECRETARIES OFFICE WORKERS SHOPKEEPERS PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO OTHERS IN CAFÉS: AROUND FORTY THEY FEEL SWOLLEN WITH AN EXPERIENCE THEY CAN’T GET RID OF. LUCKILY THEY’VE MADE CHILDREN ON WHOM THEY CAN PASS IT OFF. THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THEIR PAST IS NOT LOST THAT THEIR MEMORIES ARE CONDENSED GENTLY TRANSFORMED INTO WISDOM. CONVENIENT PAST! PAST HANDED OUT OF A POCKET! LITTLE GILT BOOKS FULL OF FINE SAYINGS. “BELIEVE ME I’M TELLING YOU FROM EXPERIENCE ALL I KNOW I’VE LEARNED FROM LIFE.” HAS LIFE TAKEN CHARGE OF THEIR THOUGHTS? THEY EXPLAIN THE NEW BY THE OLD—AND THE OLD THEY EXPLAIN BY THE OLDER STILL LIKE THOSE HISTORIANS WHO TURN A LENIN INTO A RUSSIAN ROBESPIERRE AND A ROBESPIERRE INTO A FRENCH CROMWELL: WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING AT ALL. . . . YOU CAN IMAGINE A MOROSE IDLENESS BEHIND THEIR IMPORTANCE: THEY SEE THE LONG PARADE OF PRETENCES THEY YAWN THEY THINK THERE’S NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN. “CRAZY AS A LOON”—AND DOCTOR ROGÉ VAGUELY RECALLS OTHER CRAZY LOONS NOT REMEMBERING ANY ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR. NOW NOTHING M. ACHILLE CAN DO WILL SURPRISE US: HECAUSE HE’S A CRAZY LOON!

HE IS NOT ONE: HE IS AFRAID. WHAT IS HE AFRAID OF? WHEN YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU STAND IN FRONT OF IT ALONE WITHOUT HELP: ALL THE PAST IN THE WORLD IS OF NO USE. THEN IT DISAPPEARS AND WHAT YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPEARS WITH IT.

GENERAL IDEAS ARE MORE FLATTERING. AND THEN PROFESSIONALS AND EVEN AMATEURS ALWAYS END UP BY BEING RIGHT. THEIR WISDOM PROMPTS THEM TO MAKE THE LEAST POSSIBLE NOISE TO LIVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO LET THEMSELVES BE FORGOTTEN. THEIR BEST STORIES ARE ABOUT THE RASH AND THE ORIGINAL WHO WERE CHASTISED. YES THAT’S HOW IT HAPPENS AND NO ONE WILL SAY THE CONTRARY. PERHAPS M. ACHILLE’S CONSCIENCE IS NOT EASY. PERHAPS HE TELLS HIMSELF HE WOULDN’T BE THERE IF HE HAD HEEDED HIS FATHER’S ADVICE OR HIS ELDER SISTER’S. THE DOCTOR HAS THE RIGHT TO SPEAK: HE HAS NOT WASTED HIS LIFE; HE HAS KNOWN HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF USEFUL. HE RISES CALM AND POWERFUL ABOVE THIS FLOTSAM AND JETSAM; HE IS A ROCK.

DOCTOR ROGÉ HAS FINISHED HIS CALVADOS. HIS GREAT BODY RELAXES AND HIS EYELIDS DROOP HEAVILY. FOR THE FIRST TIME I SEE HIS FACE WITHOUT THE EYES: LIKE A CARDBOARD MASK THE KIND THEY’RE SELLING IN THE SHOPS TODAY. HIS CHEEKS HAVE A HORRID PINK COLOUR. . . . THE TRUTH STARES ME IN THE FACE: THIS MAN IS GOING TO DIE SOON. HE SURELY KNOWS; HE NEED ONLY LOOK IN THE GLASS: EACH DAY HE LOOKS A LITTLE MORE LIKE THE CORPSE HE WILL BECOME. THAT’S WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE LEADS TO THAT’S WHY I TELL MYSELF SO OFTEN THAT THEY SMELL OF DEATH: IT IS THEIR LAST DEFENCE. THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE HE WOULD LIKE TO HIDE OUT THE STARK REALITY; THAT HE IS ALONE WITHOUT GAIN WITHOUT A PAST WITH AN INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS CLOUDED A BODY WHICH IS DISINTEGRATING. FOR THIS REASON HE HAS CAREFULLY BUILT UP FURNISHED AND PADDED HIS NIGHTMARE COMPENSATION: HE SAYS HE IS MAKING PROGRESS. HAS HE VACUUMS IN HIS THOUGHTS MOMENTS WHEN EVERYTHING SPINS ROUND IN HIS HEAD? IT’S BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENT NO LONGER HAS THE IMPULSE OF YOUTH. HE NO LONGER UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE READS IN BOOKS? IT’S BECAUSE HE’S SO FAR AWAY FROM BOOKS NOW. HE CAN’T MAKE LOVE ANY MORE? BUT HE HAS MADE LOVE IN THE PAST. HAVING MADE LOVE IS MUCH BETTER THAN STILL MAKING IT: LOOKING BACK HE COMPARES PONDERS. AND THIS TERRIBLE CORPSE’S FACE! TO BE ABLE TO STAND THE SIGHT OF IT IN THE GLASS HE MAKES HIMSELF BELIEVE THAT THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE ARE GRAVEN ON IT.

THE DOCTOR TURNS HIS HEAD A LITTLE. HIS EYELIDS ARE HALF-OPEN AND HE WATCHES ME WITH THE RED EYES OF SLEEP. I SMILE AT HIM. I WOULD LIKE THIS SMILE TO REVEAL ALL THAT HE IS TRYING TO HIDE FROM HIMSELF. THAT WOULD GIVE HIM A JOLT IF HE COULD SAY TO HIMSELF: “THERE’S SOMEONE WHO KNOWS I’M GOING TO DIE!” BUT HIS EYELIDS DROOP: HE SLEEPS. I LEAVE LETTING M. ACHILLE WATCH OVER HIS SLUMBER.

THE RAIN HAS STOPPED THE AIR IS MILD THE SKY SLOWLY ROLLS UP FINE BLACK IMAGES: IT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO FRAME A PERFECT MOMENT; TO REFLECT THESE IMAGES ANNY WOULD CAUSE DARK LITTLE TIDES TO BE BORN IN OUR HEARTS. I DON’T KNOW HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION: I WALK AT RANDOM CALM AND EMPTY UNDER THIS WASTED SKY.

WEDNESDAY:

I MUST NOT BE AFRAID.

THURSDAY:

FOUR PAGES WRITTEN. THEN A LONG MOMENT OF HAPPINESS. MUST NOT THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE VALUE OF HISTORY. YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING DISGUSTED WITH IT. MUST NOT FORGET THAT DE ROLLEBON NOW REPRESENTS THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR MY EXISTENCE.

A WEEK FROM TODAY I’M GOING TO SEE ANNY.

FRIDAY:

THE FOG WAS SO THICK ON THE BOULEVARD DE LA REDOUTE THAT I THOUGHT IT WISE TO STICK CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CASERNE; ON MY RIGHT THE HEADLIGHTS OF CARS CHASED A MISTY LIGHT BEFORE THEM AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE END OF THE PAVEMENT. THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND ME; I SOMETIMES HEARD THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS OR THE LOW HUM OF THEIR VOICES: BUT I SAW NO ONE. ONCE A WOMAN’S FACE TOOK SHAPE SOMEWHERE AT THE HEIGHT OF MY SHOULDER BUT THE FOG ENGULFED IT IMMEDIATELY; ANOTHER TIME SOMEONE BRUSHED BY ME BREATHING VERY HEAVILY. I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING I WAS TOO ABSORBED: YOU HAD TO GO AHEAD WITH CAUTION FEEL THE GROUND WITH THE END OF YOUR FOOT AND EVEN STRETCH YOUR HANDS AHEAD OF YOU. I GOT NO PLEASURE FROM THIS EXERCISE. YET I WASN’T THINKING ABOUT GOING BACK I WAS CAUGHT. FINALLY AFTER HALF AN HOUR I NOTICED A BLUISH VAPOUR IN THE DISTANCE. USING THIS AS A GUIDE I SOON ARRIVED AT THE EDGE OF A GREAT GLOW; IN THE CENTRE PIERCING THE FOG WITH ITS LIGHTS I RECOGNIZED THE CAFÉ MABLY.

THE CAFÉ MABLY HAS TWELVE ELECTRIC LIGHTS BUT ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE ON ONE ABOVE THE COUNTER THE OTHER ON THE CEILING. THE ONLY WAITER THERE PUSHED ME FORCIBLY INTO A DARK CORNER.

“THIS WAY MONSIEUR I’M CLEANING UP.”

HE HAD ON A JACKET WITHOUT VEST OR COLLAR WITH A WHITE AND VIOLET STRIPED SHIRT. HE WAS YAWNING LOOKING AT ME SOURLY RUNNING HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR.

“BLACK COFFEE AND ROLLS.”

HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITHOUT ANSWERING AND WENT AWAY. I WAS UP TO MY EYES IN SHADOW AN ICY DIRTY SHADOW. THE RADIATOR WAS SURELY NOT WORKING.

I WAS NOT ALONE. A WOMAN WITH A WAXY COMPLEXION WAS SITTING OPPOSITE ME AND HER HANDS TREMBLED UNCEASINGLY SOMETIMES SMOOTHING HER BLOUSE SOMETIMES STRAIGHTENING HER BLACK HAT. SHE WAS WITH A BIG BLOND MAN EATING A BRIOCHE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. THE SILENCE WEIGHED ON ME I WANTED TO LIGHT MY PIPE BUT I WOULD HAVE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ATTRACTING THEIR ATTENTION BY STRIKING THE MATCH.

THE TELEPHONE BELL RINGS. THE HANDS STOPPED: THEY STAYED CLUTCHING AT THE BLOUSE. THE WAITER TOOK HIS TIME. HE CALMLY FINISHED SWEEPING BEFORE GOING TO TAKE OFF THE RECEIVER. “HELLO IS THAT MONSIEUR GEORGES? GOOD MORNING MONSIEUR GEORGES . . . YES MONSIEUR GEORGES . . . THE PATRON ISN’T HERE . . . YES HE SHOULD BE DOWN . . . YES BUT WITH A FOG LIKE THIS . . . HE GENERALLY COMES DOWN ABOUT EIGHT . . . YES MONSIEUR GEORGES I’LL TELL HIM. GOOD-BYE MONSIEUR GEORGES.”

FOG WEIGHED ON THE WINDOWS LIKE A HEAVY CURTAIN OF GREY VELVET. A FACE PRESSED AGAINST THE PANE FOR AN INSTANT DISAPPEARED.

THE WOMAN SAID PLAINTIVELY:

“TIE UP MY SHOE FOR ME.”

“IT ISN’T UNTIED” THE MAN SAID WITHOUT LOOKING.

SHE GREW AGITATED. HER HANDS MOVED ALONG HER BLOUSE AND OVER HER NECK LIKE LARGE SPIDERS.

“YES YES DO UP MY SHOE.”

HE BENT DOWN LOOKING CROSS AND LIGHTLY TOUCHED HER FOOT UNDER THE TABLE.

“IT’S DONE.”

SHE SMILED WITH SATISFACTION. THE MAN CALLED THE WAITER.

“HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?”

“HOW MANY BRIOCHES?” THE WAITER ASKED.

I HAD LOWERED MY EYES SO AS NOT TO SEEM TO STARE AT THEM. AFTER A FEW INSTANTS I HEARD A CREAKING AND SAW THE HEM OF A SKIRT AND TWO SHOES STAINED WITH DRY MUD APPEAR. THE MAN’S SHOES FOLLOWED POLISHED AND POINTED. THEY CAME TOWARDS ME STOPPED AND TURNED SIDEWAYS: HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS COAT. AT THAT MOMENT A HAND AT THE END OF A STIFF ARM MOVED DOWNWARDS; HESITATED A MOMENT THEN SCRATCHED AT THE SKIRT.

“READY?” THE MAN ASKED.

THE HAND OPENED AND TOUCHED A LARGE SPLASH OF MUD ON THE RIGHT SHOE THEN DISAPPEARED.

HE HAD PICKED UP A SUITCASE NEAR THE COAT RACK. THEY WENT OUT I SAW THEM SWALLOWED UP IN THE FOG.

“THEY’RE ON THE STAGE” THE WAITER TOLD ME AS HE BROUGHT ME COFFEE.

“THEY PLAY THE ENTR’ACTE AT THE CINÉ-PALACE. THE WOMAN BLINDFOLDS HERSELF AND TELLS THE NAME AND AGE OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE. THEY’RE LEAVING TODAY BECAUSE IT’S FRIDAY AND THE PROGRAMME CHANGES.”

HE WENT TO GET A PLATE OF ROLLS FROM THE TABLE THE PEOPLE HAD JUST LEFT.

“DON’T BOTHER.”

I DIDN’T FEEL INCLINED TO EAT THOSE ROLLS.

“I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE LIGHT. TWO LIGHTS FOR ONE CUSTOMER AT NINE IN THE MORNING: THE PATRON WOULD GIVE ME HELL.”

SHADOW FLOODS THE CAFÉ. A FEEBLE ILLUMINATION SPATTERED WITH GREY AND BROWN FALLS ON THE UPPER WINDOWS.

“I’D LIKE TO SEE M. FASQUELLE.”

I HADN’T SEEN THE OLD WOMAN COME IN. A GUST OF COLD AIR MADE ME SHIVER.

“M. FASQUELLE HASN’T COME DOWN YET.”

“MME FLORENT SENT ME” SHE WENT ON “SHE ISN’T WELL. SHE WON’T BE IN TODAY.”

MME FLORENT IS THE CASHIER THE RED-HAIRED GIRL.

“THIS WEATHER” THE OLD WOMAN SAID “IS BAD FOR HER STOMACH.”

THE WAITER PUT ON AN IMPORTANT AIR:

“IT’S THE FOG” HE ANSWERED “M. FASQUELLE HAS THE SAME TROUBLE; I’M SURPRISED HE ISN’T DOWN YET. SOMEBODY TELEPHONED FOR HIM. USUALLY HE’S DOWN AT EIGHT.”

MECHANICALLY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AT THE CEILING.

“IS HE UP THERE?”

“YES THAT’S HIS ROOM.”

IN A DRAGGING VOICE AS IF SHE WERE TALKING TO HERSELF THE OLD WOMAN SAID:

“SUPPOSE HE’S DEAD. . . .”

“WELL! . . .” THE WAITER’S FACE SHOWED LIVELY INDIGNATION. “WELL I NEVER!”

SUPPOSE HE WERE DEAD. . . . THIS THOUGHT BRUSHED BY ME. JUST THE KIND OF IDEA YOU GET ON FOGGY DAYS.

THE OLD WOMAN LEFT. I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME: IT WAS COLD AND DARK. THE FOG FILTERED IN UNDER THE DOOR IT WAS GOING TO RISE SLOWLY AND PENETRATE EVERYTHING. I COULD HAVE FOUND LIGHT AND WARMTH AT THE LIBRARY.

AGAIN A FACE CAME AND PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOW; IT GRIMACED.

“YOU JUST WAIT” THE WAITER SAID ANGRILY AND RAN OUT.

THE FACE DISAPPEARED I WAS ALONE. I REPROACHED MYSELF BITTERLY FOR LEAVING MY ROOM. THE FOG WOULD HAVE FILLED IT BY THIS TIME; I WOULD BE AFRAID TO GO BACK.

BEHIND THE CASHIER’S TABLE IN THE SHADOW SOMETHING CRACKED. IT CAME FROM THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE: WAS THE MANAGER COMING DOWN AT LAST? NO: THERE WAS NO ONE; THE STEPS WERE CRACKING BY THEMSELVES. M. FASQUELLE WAS STILL SLEEPING. OR ELSE HE WAS DEAD UP THERE ABOVE MY HEAD. FOUND DEAD IN BED ONE FOGGY MORNING—SUB-HEADING: IN THE CAFÉ CUSTOMERS WENT ON EATING WITHOUT SUSPECTING.

BUT WAS HE STILL IN BED? HADN’T HE FALLEN OUT DRAGGING THE SHEETS WITH HIM BUMPING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE FLOOR?

I KNOW M. FASQUELLE VERY WELL; HE SOMETIMES ASKS AFTER MY HEALTH. A BIG JOLLY FELLOW WITH A CAREFULLY COMBED BEARD: IF HE IS DEAD IT’S FROM A STROKE. HE WILL BE THE COLOUR OF EGGPLANT WITH HIS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF HIS MOUTH. THE BEARD IN THE AIR THE NECK VIOLET UNDER THE FRIZZLE OF HAIR.

THE PRIVATE STAIRWAY IS LOST IN DARKNESS. I CAN HARDLY MAKE OUT THE NEWEL POST. THIS SHADOW WOULD HAVE TO BE CROSSED. THE STAIRS WOULD CREAK. ABOVE I WOULD FIND THE DOOR OF THE ROOM . . .

THE BODY IS THERE OVER MY HEAD. I WOULD TURN THE SWITCH: I WOULD TOUCH HIS WARM SKIN TO SEE . . . I CAN’T STAND ANY MORE I GET UP. IF THE WAITER CATCHES ME ON THE STAIRS I’LL TELL HIM I HEARD A NOISE.

THE WAITER CAME IN SUDDENLY BREATHLESS.

“OUI MONSIEUR!” HE SHOUTED.

IMBECILE! HE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME.

“THAT’S TWO FRANCS.”

“I HEARD A NOISE UP THERE” I TOLD HIM.

“IT’S ABOUT TIME!”

“YES BUT I THINK SOMETHING’S WRONG: IT SOUNDED LIKE CHOKING AND THEN THERE WAS A THUD.”

IT SOUNDED QUITE NATURAL IN THE DARK CAFÉ WITH THE FOG BEHIND THE WINDOWS. I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIS EYES.

“YOU OUGHT TO GO UP AND SEE” I ADDED SLYLY.

“OH NO!” HE SAID; THEN: “I’M AFRAID HE’D GIVE ME HELL. WHAT TIME IS IT?”

“TEN.”

“IF HE ISN’T DOWN HERE BY TEN-THIRTY I’LL GO UP.”

I TOOK A STEP TOWARDS THE DOOR.

“YOU’RE GOING? YOU AREN’T GOING TO STAY?”

“NO.”

“DID IT SOUND LIKE A DEATH RATTLE?”

“I DON’T KNOW” I TOLD HIM AS I WALKED OUT “MAYBE JUST BECAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.”

THE FOG HAD LIFTED A LITTLE. I HURRIED TOWARDS THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE: I LONGED FOR ITS LIGHTS. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT: THERE WAS LIGHT CERTAINLY DRIPPING DOWN THE STORE WINDOWS. BUT IT WASN’T A GAY LIGHT: IT WAS ALL WHITE BECAUSE OF THE FOG AND RAINED DOWN ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT ESPECIALLY WOMEN MAIDS CHARWOMEN LADIES AS WELL THE KIND WHO SAY “I DO MY OWN BUYING IT’S SAFER.” THEY SNIFFED AT THE WINDOW DISPLAYS AND FINALLY WENT IN.

I STOPPED IN FRONT OF JULIEN’S PORK-BUTCHER SHOP. THROUGH THE GLASS FROM TIME TO TIME I COULD SEE A HAND DESIGNING THE TRUFFLED PIGS’ FEET AND THE SAUSAGES. THEN A FAT BLONDE GIRL BENT OVER HER BOSOM SHOWING AND PICKED UP A PIECE OF DEAD FLESH BETWEEN HER FINGERS. IN HIS ROOM FIVE MINUTES FROM THERE M. FASQUELLE WAS DEAD.

I LOOKED AROUND ME FOR SUPPORT A REFUGE FROM MY THOUGHTS. THERE WAS NONE: LITTLE BY LITTLE THE FOG LIFTED BUT SOME DISQUIETING THING STAYED BEHIND IN THE STREETS. PERHAPS NOT A REAL MENACE: IT WAS PALE TRANSPARENT. BUT IT WAS THAT WHICH FINALLY FRIGHTENED ME. I LEANED MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW. I NOTICED A DARK RED DROP ON THE MAYONNAISE OF A STUFFED EGG: IT WAS BLOOD. THIS RED ON THE YELLOW MADE ME SICK AT MY STOMACH.

SUDDENLY I HAD A VISION: SOMEONE HAD FALLEN FACE DOWN AND WAS BLEEDING IN THE DISHES. THE EGG HAD ROLLED IN BLOOD; THE SLICE OF TOMATO WHICH CROWNED IT HAD COME OFF AND FALLEN FLAT RED ON RED. THE MAYONNAISE HAD RUN A LITTLE: A POOL OF YELLOW CREAM WHICH DIVIDED THE TRICKLE OF BLOOD INTO TWO ARMS.

“THIS IS REALLY TOO SILLY I MUST PULL MYSELF TOGETHER. I’M GOING TO WORK IN THE LIBRARY.”

WORK? I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL I SHOULDN’T WRITE A LINE. ANOTHER DAY WASTED. CROSSING THE PARK I SAW A GREAT BLUE CAPE MOTIONLESS ON THE BENCH WHERE I USUALLY SIT. THERE’S SOMEONE AT LEAST WHO ISN’T COLD.

WHEN I ENTERED THE READING-ROOM THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WAS JUST COMING OUT. HE THREW HIMSELF ON ME:

“I HAVE TO THANK YOU MONSIEUR. YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SPEND MANY UNFORGETTABLE HOURS.”

I HAD A RAY OF HOPE WHEN I SAW HIM; IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO GET THROUGH THIS DAY TOGETHER. BUT WITH THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN YOU ONLY APPEAR TO BE TWO.

HE RAPPED ON AN IN-QUARTO VOLUME. IT WAS A HISTORY OF RELIGION.

“MONSIEUR NO ONE WAS BETTER QUALIFIED THAN NOUÇAPIÉ TO ATTEMPT THIS VAST SYNTHESIS. ISN’T THAT TRUE?”

HE SEEMED WEARY AND HIS HANDS WERE TREMBLING.

“YOU LOOK ILL” I SAID.

“AH MONSIEUR I SHOULD THINK SO! SOMETHING ABOMINABLE HAS HAPPENED TO ME.”

THE GUARDIAN CAME TOWARDS US: A PEEVISH LITTLE CORSICAN WITH MOUSTACHES LIKE A DRUM MAJOR. HE WALKS FOR WHOLE HOURS AMONG THE TABLES CLACKING HIS HEELS. IN WINTER HE SPITS IN HIS HANDKERCHIEFS THEN DRIES THEM ON THE STOVE.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO BREATHE IN MY FACE.

“I WON’T TELL YOU ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THIS MAN” HE SAID IN CONFIDENCE. “IF YOU WOULD MONSIEUR . . .”

“WOULD WHAT?”

HE BLUSHED AND HIS LIPS SWAYED GRACEFULLY.

“MONSIEUR AH MONSIEUR: ALL RIGHT I’LL LAY MY CARDS ON THE TABLE. WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOUR OF LUNCHING WITH ME ON WEDNESDAY?”

“WITH PLEASURE.”

I HAD AS MUCH DESIRE TO EAT WITH HIM AS I HAD TO HANG MYSELF.

“I’M SO GLAD” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAID. HE ADDED RAPIDLY “I’LL PICK YOU UP AT YOUR HOTEL IF YOU LIKE” THEN DISAPPEARED AFRAID UNDOUBTEDLY THAT I WOULD CHANGE MY MIND IF HE GAVE ME TIME.

IT WAS ELEVEN-THIRTY. I WORKED UNTIL QUARTER OF TWO. POOR WORK: I HAD A BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY THOUGHTS RETURNED INCESSANTLY TO THE CAFÉ MABLY. HAD M. FASQUELLE COME DOWN BY NOW? AT HEART I DIDN’T BELIEVE HE WAS DEAD AND THIS WAS PRECISELY WHAT IRRITATED ME: IT WAS A FLOATING IDEA WHICH I COULD NEITHER PERSUADE MYSELF TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE. THE CORSICAN’S SHOES CREAKED ON THE FLOOR. SEVERAL TIMES HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF ME AS THOUGH HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME. BUT HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND WENT AWAY.

THE LAST READERS LEFT AROUND ONE O’CLOCK. I WASN’T HUNGRY; ABOVE ALL I DIDN’T WANT TO LEAVE. I WORKED A MOMENT MORE THEN STARTED UP; I FELT SHROUDED IN SILENCE.

I RAISED MY HEAD: I WAS ALONE. THE CORSICAN MUST HAVE GONE DOWN TO HIS WIFE WHO IS THE CONCIERGE OF THE LIBRARY; I WANTED TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS. JUST THEN I HEARD A PIECE OF COAL FALL IN THE STOVE. FOG HAD FILLED THE ROOM: NOT THE REAL FOG THAT HAD GONE A LONG TIME AGO—BUT THE OTHER THE ONE THE STREETS WERE STILL FULL OF WHICH CAME OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVEMENTS. THE INCONSISTENCY OF INANIMATE OBJECTS! THE BOOKS WERE STILL THERE ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER ON THE SHELVES WITH THEIR BROWN AND BLACK BACKS AND THEIR LABELS UP IF 7.996 (FOR PUBLIC USE—FRENCH LITERATURE—) OR UP SN (FOR PUBLIC USE—NATURAL SCIENCE). BUT . . . HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT? USUALLY POWERFUL AND SQUAT ALONG WITH THE STOVE THE GREEN LAMPS THE WIDE WINDOWS THE LADDERS THEY DAM UP THE FUTURE. AS LONG AS YOU STAY BETWEEN THESE WALLS WHATEVER HAPPENS MUST HAPPEN ON THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT OF THE STOVE. SAINT DENIS HIMSELF COULD COME IN CARRYING HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND HE WOULD STILL HAVE TO ENTER ON THE RIGHT WALK BETWEEN THE SHELVES DEVOTED TO FRENCH LITERATURE AND THE TABLE RESERVED FOR WOMEN READERS. AND IF HE DOESN’T TOUCH THE GROUND IF HE FLOATS TEN INCHES ABOVE THE FLOOR HIS BLEEDING NECK WILL BE JUST AT THE LEVEL OF THE THIRD SHELF OF BOOKS. THUS THESE OBJECTS SERVE AT LEAST TO FIX THE LIMITS OF PROBABILITY.

TODAY THEY FIXED NOTHING AT ALL: IT SEEMED THAT THEIR VERY EXISTENCE WAS SUBJECT TO DOUBT THAT THEY HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN PASSING FROM ONE INSTANT TO THE NEXT. I HELD THE BOOK I WAS READING TIGHTLY IN MY HANDS: BUT THE MOST VIOLENT SENSATIONS WENT DEAD. NOTHING SEEMED TRUE; I FELT SURROUNDED BY CARDBOARD SCENERY WHICH COULD QUICKLY BE REMOVED. THE WORLD WAS WAITING HOLDING ITS BREATH MAKING ITSELF SMALL—IT WAS WAITING FOR ITS CONVULSION ITS NAUSEA JUST LIKE M. ACHILLE THE OTHER DAY.

I GOT UP. I COULD NO LONGER KEEP MY PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THESE UNNATURAL OBJECTS. I WENT TO THE WINDOW AND GLANCED OUT AT THE SKULL OF IMPÉTRAZ. I MURMURED: ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING. BUT EVIDENTLY IT WOULD BE NOTHING HORRIBLE SUCH AS HUMANS MIGHT INVENT. IMPÉTRAZ WAS NOT GOING TO START DANCING ON HIS PEDESTAL: IT WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

FRIGHTENED I LOOKED AT THESE UNSTABLE BEINGS WHICH IN AN HOUR IN A MINUTE WERE PERHAPS GOING TO CRUMBLE: YES I WAS THERE LIVING IN THE MIDST OF THESE BOOKS FULL OF KNOWLEDGE DESCRIBING THE IMMUTABLE FORMS OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES EXPLAINING THAT THE RIGHT QUANTITY OF ENERGY IS KEPT INTEGRAL IN THE UNIVERSE; I WAS THERE STANDING IN FRONT OF A WINDOW WHOSE PANES HAD A DEFINITE REFRACTION INDEX. BUT WHAT FEEBLE BARRIERS! I SUPPOSE IT IS OUT OF LAZINESS THAT THE WORLD IS THE SAME DAY AFTER DAY. TODAY IT SEEMED TO WANT TO CHANGE. AND THEN ANYTHING ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

I HAD NO TIME TO LOSE: THE CAFÉ MABLY AFFAIR WAS AT THE ROOT OF THIS UNEASINESS. I MUST GO BACK THERE SEE M. FASQUELLE ALIVE TOUCH HIS BEARD OR HIS HANDS IF NEED BE. THEN PERHAPS I WOULD BE FREE.

I SEIZED MY OVERCOAT AND THREW IT ROUND MY SHOULDERS; I FLED. CROSSING THE PUBLIC GARDENS I SAW ONCE MORE THE MAN IN THE BLUE CAPE. HE HAD THE SAME GHASTLY WHITE FACE WITH TWO SCARLET EARS STICKING OUT ON EITHER SIDE.

THE CAFÉ MABLY SPARKLED IN THE DISTANCE: THIS TIME THE TWELVE LIGHTS MUST HAVE BEEN LIT. I HURRIED: I HAD TO GET IT OVER. FIRST I GLANCED IN THROUGH THE BIG WINDOW THE PLACE WAS DESERTED. THE CASHIER WAS NOT THERE NOR THE WAITER—NOR M. FASQUELLE.

I HAD TO MAKE A GREAT EFFORT TO GO IN; I DID NOT SIT DOWN. I SHOUTED “WAITER!” NO ONE ANSWERED. AN EMPTY CUP ON A TABLE. A LUMP OF SUGAR ON THE SAUCER.

“ANYONE HERE?”

AN OVERCOAT HUNG FROM A PEG. MAGAZINES WERE PILED UP IN BLACK CARDBOARD BOXES ON A LOW TABLE. I WAS ON THE ALERT FOR THE SLIGHTEST SOUND HOLDING MY BREATH. THE PRIVATE STAIRWAY CREAKED SLIGHTLY. I HEARD A FOGHORN OUTSIDE. I WALKED OUT BACKWARDS MY EYES NEVER LEAVING THE STAIRWAY.

I KNOW: CUSTOMERS ARE RARE AT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON. M. FASQUELLE HAD INFLUENZA; HE MUST HAVE SENT THE WAITER OUT ON AN ERRAND—MAYBE TO GET A DOCTOR. YES BUT I NEEDED TO SEE M. FASQUELLE. AT THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE I TURNED BACK I STUDIED THE GARISH DESERTED CAFÉ WITH DISGUST. THE BLINDS ON THE SECOND FLOOR WERE DRAWN.

A REAL PANIC TOOK HOLD OF ME. I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING. I RAN ALONG THE DOCKS TURNED INTO THE DESERTED STREETS IN THE BEAUVOISIS DISTRICT; THE HOUSES WATCHED MY FLIGHT WITH THEIR MOURNFUL EYES. I REPEATED WITH ANGUISH: WHERE SHALL I GO? WHERE SHALL I GO? ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. SOMETIMES MY HEART POUNDING I MADE A SUDDEN RIGHT-ABOUT-TURN: WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEHIND MY BACK? MAYBE IT WOULD START BEHIND ME AND WHEN I WOULD TURN AROUND SUDDENLY IT WOULD BE TOO LATE. AS LONG AS I COULD STARE AT THINGS NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN: I LOOKED AT THEM AS MUCH AS I COULD PAVEMENTS HOUSES GASLIGHTS; MY EYES WENT RAPIDLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER TO CATCH THEM UNAWARES STOP THEM IN THE MIDST OF THEIR METAMORPHOSIS. THEY DIDN’T LOOK TOO NATURAL BUT I TOLD MYSELF FORCIBLY: THIS IS A GASLIGHT THIS IS A DRINKING FOUNTAIN AND I TRIED TO REDUCE THEM TO THEIR EVERYDAY ASPECT BY THE POWER OF MY GAZE. SEVERAL TIMES I CAME ACROSS BARRIERS IN MY PATH: THE CAFÉ DES BRETONS THE BAR DE LA MARINE. I STOPPED HESITATED IN FRONT OF THEIR PINK NET CURTAINS: PERHAPS THESE SNUG PLACES HAD BEEN SPARED PERHAPS THEY STILL HELD A BIT OF YESTERDAY’S WORLD ISOLATED FORGOTTEN. BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PUSH THE DOOR OPEN AND ENTER. I DIDN’T DARE; I WENT ON. DOORS OF HOUSES FRIGHTENED ME ESPECIALLY. I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD OPEN OF THEMSELVES. I ENDED BY WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

I SUDDENLY CAME OUT ON THE QUAI DES BASSINS DU NORD. FISHING SMACKS AND SMALL YACHTS. I PUT MY FOOT ON A RING SET IN THE STONE. HERE FAR FROM HOUSES FAR FROM DOORS I WOULD HAVE A MOMENT OF RESPITE. A CORK WAS FLOATING ON THE CALM BLACK-SPECKLED WATER.

“AND UNDER THE WATER? YOU HAVEN’T THOUGHT WHAT COULD BE UNDER THE WATER.”

A MONSTER? A GIANT CARAPACE? SUNK IN THE MUD? A DOZEN PAIRS OF CLAWS OR FINS LABOURING SLOWLY IN THE SLIME. THE MONSTER RISES. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER. I WENT NEARER WATCHING EVERY EDDY AND UNDULATION. THE CORK STAYED IMMOBILE AMONG THE BLACK SPOTS.

THEN I HEARD VOICES. IT WAS TIME. I TURNED AND BEGAN MY RACE AGAIN.

I CAUGHT UP WITH TWO MEN WHO WERE TALKING IN THE RUE CASTIGLIONE. AT THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS THEY STARTED VIOLENTLY AND BOTH TURNED ROUND. I SAW THEIR WORRIED EYES UPON ME THEN BEHIND ME TO SEE IF SOMETHING ELSE WAS COMING. WERE THEY LIKE ME? WERE THEY TOO AFRAID? WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN PASSING: A LITTLE MORE AND WE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN. BUT THE LOOKS SUDDENLY EXPRESSED DEFIANCE: ON A DAY LIKE THIS YOU DON’T SPEAK TO JUST ANYONE.

I FOUND MYSELF BREATHLESS ON THE RUE BOULIBET. THE DIE WAS CAST: I WAS GOING BACK TO THE LIBRARY TAKE A NOVEL AND TRY TO READ. GOING ALONG THE PARK RAILING I NOTICED THE MAN IN THE CAPE. HE WAS STILL THERE IN THE DESERTED PARK; HIS NOSE HAD GROWN AS RED AS HIS EARS.

I WAS GOING TO PUSH OPEN THE GATE BUT THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE STOPPED ME: HE WRINKLED HIS EYES AND HALF-GRINNED STUPIDLY AND AFFECTEDLY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD AT SOMETHING I COULD NOT SEE WITH A LOOK SO HARD AND WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT I SUDDENLY TURNED BACK.

OPPOSITE TO HIM ONE FOOT RAISED HER MOUTH HALF-OPENED A LITTLE GIRL OF ABOUT TEN FASCINATED WAS WATCHING HIM PULLING NERVOUSLY AT HER SCARF HER POINTED FACE THRUSTING FORWARD.

THE MAN WAS SMILING TO HIMSELF LIKE SOMEONE ABOUT TO PLAY A GOOD JOKE. SUDDENLY HE STOOD UP HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS CLOAK WHICH FELL TO HIS FEET. HE TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD HIS EYES ROLLING. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO FALL. BUT HE KEPT ON SMILING SLEEPILY.

I SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD: THE CLOAK! I WANTED TO STOP IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO COUGH OR OPEN THE GATE. BUT IN MY TURN I WAS FASCINATED BY THE LITTLE GIRL’S FACE. HER FEATURES WERE DRAWN WITH FEAR AND HER HEART MUST HAVE BEEN BEATING HORRIBLY: YET I COULD ALSO READ SOMETHING POWERFUL AND WICKED ON THAT RAT-LIKE FACE. IT WAS NOT CURIOSITY BUT RATHER A SORT OF ASSURED EXPECTATION. I FELT IMPOTENT: I WAS OUTSIDE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK ON THE EDGE OF THEIR LITTLE DRAMA: BUT THEY WERE RIVETED ONE TO THE OTHER BY THE OBSCURE POWER OF THEIR DESIRES THEY MADE A PAIR TOGETHER. I HELD MY BREATH I WANTED TO SEE WHAT EXPRESSION WOULD COME ON THAT ELFISH FACE WHEN THE MAN BEHIND MY BACK WOULD SPREAD OUT THE FOLDS OF HIS CLOAK.

BUT SUDDENLY FREED THE LITTLE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO RUN. THE MAN IN THE CLOAK HAD SEEN ME: THAT WAS WHAT STOPPED HIM. FOR A SECOND HE STAYED MOTIONLESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH THEN WENT OFF HIS BACK HUNCHED. THE CLOAK FLAPPED AGAINST HIS CALVES.

I PUSHED OPEN THE GATE AND WAS NEXT TO HIM IN ONE BOUND.

“HEY!” I SHOUTED.

HE BEGAN TO TREMBLE.

“A GREAT MENACE WEIGHS OVER THE CITY” I SAID POLITELY AND WENT ON.

I WENT INTO THE READING-ROOM AND TOOK THE CHARTREUSE DE PARME FROM A TABLE. I TRIED TO ABSORB MYSELF IN READING TO FIND A REFUGE IN THE LUCID ITALY OF STENDHAL. SOMETIMES I SUCCEEDED IN SPURTS IN SHORT HALLUCINATIONS THEN FELL BACK AGAIN INTO THIS DAY OF MENACE; OPPOSITE AN OLD MAN WHO WAS CLEARING HIS THROAT A YOUNG MAN DREAMING LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR.

HOURS PASSED THE WINDOWS HAD TURNED BLACK. THERE WERE FOUR OF US NOT COUNTING THE CORSICAN WHO WAS IN THE OFFICE STAMPING THE LATEST ACQUISITIONS OF THE LIBRARY. THERE WAS THE LITTLE OLD MAN THE BLOND YOUNG MAN A GIRL WORKING FOR HER DEGREE—AND I. FROM TIME TO TIME ONE OF US WOULD LOOK UP GLANCE RAPIDLY AND SCORNFULLY AT THE OTHER THREE AS IF HE WERE AFRAID OF THEM. ONCE THE OLD MAN STARTED TO LAUGH: I SAW THE GIRL TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO FOOT. BUT I HAD DECIPHERED FROM UPSIDE DOWN THE TITLE OF THE BOOK SHE WAS READING: IT WAS A LIGHT NOVEL.

TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN. I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT THE LIBRARY CLOSED AT SEVEN. ONCE AGAIN I WAS GOING TO BE CAST OUT INTO THE TOWN. WHERE WOULD I GO? WHAT WOULD I DO?

THE OLD MAN HAD FINISHED HIS BOOK. BUT HE DID NOT LEAVE. HE TAPPED HIS FINGER ON THE TABLE WITH SHARP REGULAR BEATS.

“CLOSING TIME SOON” THE CORSICAN SAID.

THE YOUNG MAN GAVE A START AND SHOT ME A QUICK GLANCE. THE GIRL TURNED TOWARDS THE CORSICAN THEN PICKED UP HER BOOK AGAIN AND SEEMED TO DIVE INTO IT.

“CLOSING TIME” SAID THE CORSICAN FIVE MINUTES LATER.

THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD UNDECIDEDLY. THE GIRL PUSHED HER BOOK AWAY WITHOUT GETTING UP.

THE CORSICAN LOOKED BAFFLED. HE TOOK A FEW HESITATING STEPS THEN TURNED OUT THE SWITCH. THE LAMPS WENT OUT AT THE READING TABLES. ONLY THE CENTRE BULB STAYED LIGHTED.

“DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE?” THE OLD MAN ASKED QUIETLY.

THE YOUNG MAN GOT UP SLOWLY AND REGRETFULLY. IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHO WAS GOING TO TAKE THE LONGER TIME PUTTING ON HIS COAT. WHEN I LEFT THE GIRL WAS STILL SEATED ONE HAND FLAT ON HER BOOK.

BELOW THE DOOR GAPED INTO THE NIGHT. THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS WALKING AHEAD TURNED SLOWLY WENT DOWN THE STAIRS AND CROSSED THE VESTIBULE; HE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD THEN THREW HIMSELF INTO THE NIGHT AND DISAPPEARED.

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I LOOKED UP. AFTER A MOMENT THE OLD MAN LEFT THE READING-ROOM BUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT. BY THE TIME HE HAD GONE DOWN THREE STEPS I TOOK STRENGTH CLOSED MY EYES AND DIVED OUT.

I FELT A COOL LITTLE CARESS ON MY FACE. SOMEONE WAS WHISTLING IN THE DISTANCE. I RAISED MY EYES: IT WAS RAINING. A SOFT CALM RAIN. THE SQUARE WAS LIGHTED PEACEFULLY BY FOUR LAMP-POSTS. A PROVINCIAL SQUARE IN THE RAIN. THE YOUNG MAN WAS GOING FURTHER AWAY TAKING GREAT STRIDES AND WHISTLING. I WANTED TO SHOUT TO THE OTHERS WHO DID NOT YET KNOW THAT THEY COULD LEAVE WITHOUT FEAR THAT THE MENACE HAD PASSED.

THE OLD MAN APPEARED AT THE DOOR. HE SCRATCHED HIS CHEEK EMBARRASSED THEN SMILED BROADLY AND OPENED HIS UMBRELLA.

SATURDAY MORNING:

A CHARMING SUN WITH A LIGHT MIST WHICH PROMISES A CLEAR DAY. I HAD BREAKFAST AT THE CAFÉ MABLY.

MME FLORENT THE CASHIER SMILED GRACIOUSLY AT ME. I CALLED TO HER FROM MY TABLE:

“IS M. FASQUELLE SICK?”

“YES; A BAD GO OF FLU: HE’LL HAVE TO STAY IN BED A FEW DAYS. HIS DAUGHTER CAME FROM DUNKIRK THIS MORNING. SHE’S GOING TO STAY HERE AND TAKE CARE OF HIM.”

FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I GOT HER LETTER I AM DEFINITELY HAPPY AT THE IDEA OF SEEING ANNY AGAIN. WHAT HAS SHE BEEN DOING FOR SIX YEARS? SHALL WE FEEL STRANGE WHEN WE SEE EACH OTHER? ANNY DOESN’T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO FEEL AWKWARD. SHE’LL GREET ME AS IF I HAD LEFT HER YESTERDAY. I HOPE I SHAN’T MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF AND PUT HER OFF AT THE BEGINNING. I MUST REMEMBER NOT TO OFFER HER MY HAND WHEN I GET THERE: SHE HATES THAT.

HOW MANY DAYS SHALL WE STAY TOGETHER? PERHAPS I COULD BRING HER BACK TO BOUVILLE. IT WOULD BE ENOUGH IF SHE WOULD LIVE HERE ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS; IF SHE WOULD SLEEP AT THE HOTEL PRINTANIA FOR ONE NIGHT. IT WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER THAT; I SHOULDN’T BE AFRAID ANY MORE.

AFTERNOON:

WHEN I PAID MY FIRST VISIT TO THE BOUVILLE MUSEUM LAST YEAR I WAS STRUCK BY THE PORTRAIT OF OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE. FAULTY PROPORTION? PERSPECTIVE? I COULDN’T TELL BUT SOMETHING BOTHERED ME: THIS DEPUTY DIDN’T SEEM PLUMB ON HIS CANVAS.

I HAVE GONE BACK SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN. BUT MY WORRY PERSISTED. I DIDN’T WANT TO ADMIT THAT BORDURIN PRIX DE ROME HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN HIS DRAWING.

BUT THIS AFTERNOON TURNING THE PAGES OF AN OLD COLLECTION OF THE SATIRIQUE BOUVILLOIS A BLACKMAIL-SHEET WHOSE OWNER WAS ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON DURING THE WAR I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TRUTH. I WENT TO THE MUSEUM AS SOON AS I LEFT THE LIBRARY.

I CROSSED THE SHADOW OF THE VESTIBULE QUICKLY. MY STEPS MADE NO SOUND ON THE BLACK AND WHITE TILES. A WHOLE RACE OF PLASTER FOLK TWISTED THEIR ARMS. IN PASSING I GLANCED THROUGH TWO GREAT OPENINGS AND SAW CRACKED VASES PLATES AND A BLUE AND YELLOW SATYR ON A PEDESTAL. IT WAS THE BERNARD PALISSY ROOM DEVOTED TO CERAMICS AND MINOR ARTS. BUT CERAMICS DO NOT AMUSE ME. A LADY AND GENTLEMAN IN MOURNING WERE RESPECTFULLY CONTEMPLATING THE BAKED OBJECTS.

ABOVE THE ENTRANCE TO THE MAIN HALL—THE SALON BORDURIN-RENAUDAS—SOMEONE HAD HUNG UNDOUBTEDLY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE AGO A LARGE CANVAS WHICH I DID NOT RECOGNIZE. IT WAS SIGNED BY RICHARD SÉVERAND AND ENTITLED “THE BACHELOR’S DEATH.” IT WAS A GIFT OF THE STATE.

NAKED TO THE WAIST HIS BODY A LITTLE GREEN LIKE THAT OF A DEAD MAN THE BACHELOR WAS LYING ON AN UNMADE BED. THE DISORDER OF SHEETS AND BLANKETS ATTESTED TO A LONG DEATH AGONY. I SMILED THINKING ABOUT M. FASQUELLE. BUT HE WASN’T ALONE: HIS DAUGHTER WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM. ON THE CANVAS THE MAID HIS MISTRESS HER FEATURES MARKED BY VICE HAD ALREADY OPENED A BUREAU DRAWER AND WAS COUNTING THE MONEY. AN OPEN DOOR DISCLOSED A MAN IN A CAP A CIGARETTE STUCK TO HIS LOWER LIP WAITING IN THE SHADOWS. NEAR THE WALL A CAT LAPPED MILK INDIFFERENTLY.

THIS MAN HAD LIVED ONLY FOR HIMSELF. BY A HARSH AND WELL-DESERVED PUNISHMENT NO ONE HAD COME TO HIS BEDSIDE TO CLOSE HIS EYES. THIS PAINTING GAVE ME A LAST WARNING: THERE WAS STILL TIME I COULD RETRACE MY STEPS. BUT IF I WERE TO TURN A DEAF EAR I HAD BEEN FOREWARNED: MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PORTRAITS WERE HANGING ON THE WALL OF THE ROOM I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER; WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW YOUNG PEOPLE PREMATURELY TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THE MOTHER SUPERIOR OF A BOARDING SCHOOL NONE OF THOSE PAINTED HAD DIED A BACHELOR NONE OF THEM HAD DIED CHILDLESS OR INTESTATE NONE WITHOUT THE LAST RITES. THEIR SOULS AT PEACE THAT DAY AS ON OTHER DAYS WITH GOD AND THE WORLD THESE MEN HAD SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO DEATH TO CLAIM THEIR SHARE OF ETERNAL LIFE TO WHICH THEY HAD A RIGHT.

FOR THEY HAD A RIGHT TO EVERYTHING: TO LIFE TO WORK TO WEALTH TO COMMAND TO RESPECT AND FINALLY TO IMMORTALITY.

I TOOK A MOMENT TO COMPOSE MYSELF AND ENTERED. A GUARDIAN WAS SLEEPING NEAR THE WINDOW. A PALE LIGHT FALLING FROM THE WINDOWS MADE FLECKS ON THE PAINTINGS. NOTHING ALIVE IN THIS GREAT RECTANGULAR ROOM EXCEPT A CAT WHO WAS FRIGHTENED AT MY APPROACH AND FLED. BUT I FELT THE LOOKS OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAIRS OF EYES ON ME.

ALL WHO BELONGED TO THE BOUVILLE ÉLITE BETWEEN 1875 AND 1910 WERE THERE MEN AND WOMEN SCRUPULOUSLY PAINTED BY RENAUDAS AND BORDURIN.

THE MEN HAD BUILT SAINTE-CÉCILE-DE-LA-MER. IN 1882 THEY FOUNDED THE FEDERATION OF SHIPOWNERS AND MERCHANTS OF BOUVILLE “TO GROUP IN ONE POWERFUL ENTITY ALL MEN OF GOOD WILL TO CO-OPERATE IN NATIONAL RECOVERY AND TO HOLD IN CHECK THE PARTIES OF DISORDER. . . .” THEY MADE BOUVILLE THE BEST EQUIPPED PORT IN FRANCE FOR UNLOADING COAL AND WOOD. THE LENGTHENING AND WIDENING OF THE QUAYS WERE THEIR WORK. THEY EXTENDED THE MARINE TERMINAL AND BY CONSTANT DREDGING BROUGHT THE LOW-TIDE DEPTH OF ANCHORAGE TO 10.7 METERS. IN TWENTY YEARS THE CATCH OF THE FISHING FLEET WHICH WAS 5000 BARRELS IN 1869 ROSE THANKS TO THEM TO 18000 BARRELS. STOPPING AT NO SACRIFICE TO ASSIST THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE BEST ELEMENTS IN THE WORKING-CLASS THEY CREATED ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE VARIOUS CENTRES FOR TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY WHICH PROSPERED UNDER THEIR LOFTY PROTECTION. THEY BROKE THE FAMOUS SHIPPING STRIKE IN 1898 AND GAVE THEIR SONS TO THEIR COUNTRY IN 1914.

THE WOMEN WORTHY HELPMATES OF THESE STRUGGLERS FOUNDED MOST OF THE TOWN’S CHARITABLE AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS. BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WERE WIVES AND MOTHERS. THEY RAISED FINE CHILDREN TAUGHT THEM RIGHTS AND DUTIES RELIGION AND A RESPECT FOR THE TRADITIONS WHICH MADE FRANCE GREAT.

THE GENERAL COMPLEXION OF THESE PORTRAITS BORDERED ON DARK BROWN. LIVELY COLOURS HAD BEEN BANISHED OUT OF DECENCY. HOWEVER IN THE PORTRAITS OF RENAUDAS WHO SHOWED A PARTIALITY TOWARDS OLD MEN THE SNOWY HAIR AND SIDEWHISKERS SHOWED UP WELL AGAINST DEEP BLACK BACKGROUNDS; HE EXCELLED IN PAINTING HANDS. BORDURIN WHO WAS A LITTLE WEAK ON THEORY SACRIFICED THE HANDS SOMEWHAT BUT THE COLLARS SHONE LIKE WHITE MARBLE.

IT WAS VERY HOT; THE GUARDIAN WAS SNORING GENTLY. I GLANCED AROUND THE WALLS: I SAW HANDS AND EYES; HERE AND THERE A SPOT OF LIGHT OBLITERATED A FACE. AS I BEGAN WALKING TOWARDS THE PORTRAIT OF OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE SOMETHING HELD ME BACK: FROM THE MOULDING PACÔME THE MERCHANT CAST A BRIGHT LOOK DOWN ON ME.

HE WAS STANDING THERE HIS HEAD THROWN SLIGHTLY BACK; IN ONE HAND HE HELD A TOP HAT AND GLOVES AGAINST HIS PEARL-GREY TROUSERS. I COULD NOT KEEP MYSELF FROM A CERTAIN ADMIRATION: I SAW NOTHING MEDIOCRE IN HIM NOTHING WHICH ALLOWED OF CRITICISM: SMALL FEET SLENDER HANDS WIDE WRESTLER’S SHOULDERS A HINT OF WHIMSY. HE COURTEOUSLY OFFERED VISITORS THE UNWRINKLED PURITY OF HIS FACE; THE SHADOW OF A SMILE PLAYED ON THE LIPS. BUT HIS GREY EYES WERE NOT SMILING. HE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIFTY: BUT HE WAS AS YOUNG AND FRESH AS A MAN OF THIRTY. HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

I GAVE UP FINDING FAULT WITH HIM. BUT HE DID NOT LET GO OF ME. I READ A CALM AND IMPLACABLE JUDGMENT IN HIS EYES.

THEN I REALIZED WHAT SEPARATED US: WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM COULD NOT REACH HIM; IT WAS PSYCHOLOGY THE KIND THEY WRITE ABOUT IN BOOKS. BUT HIS JUDGMENT WENT THROUGH ME LIKE A SWORD AND QUESTIONED MY VERY RIGHT TO EXIST. AND IT WAS TRUE I HAD ALWAYS REALIZED IT; I HADN’T THE RIGHT TO EXIST. I HAD APPEARED BY CHANCE I EXISTED LIKE A STONE A PLANT OR A MICROBE. MY LIFE PUT OUT FEELERS TOWARDS SMALL PLEASURES IN EVERY DIRECTION. SOMETIMES IT SENT OUT VAGUE SIGNALS; AT OTHER TIMES I FELT NOTHING MORE THAN A HARMLESS BUZZING.

BUT FOR THIS HANDSOME FAULTLESS MAN NOW DEAD FOR JEAN PACÔME SON OF THE PACÔME OF THE DÉFENCE NATIONALE IT HAD BEEN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER: THE BEATING OF HIS HEART AND THE MUTE RUMBLINGS OF HIS ORGANS IN HIS CASE ASSUMED THE FORM OF RIGHTS TO BE INSTANTLY OBEYED. FOR SIXTY YEARS WITHOUT A HALT HE HAD USED HIS RIGHT TO LIVE. THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT HAD NEVER CROSSED THOSE MAGNIFICENT GREY EYES. PACÔME HAD NEVER MADE A MISTAKE. HE HAD ALWAYS DONE HIS DUTY ALL HIS DUTY HIS DUTY AS SON HUSBAND FATHER LEADER. HE HAD NEVER WEAKENED IN HIS DEMANDS FOR HIS DUE: AS A CHILD THE RIGHT TO BE WELL BROUGHT UP IN A UNITED FAMILY THE RIGHT TO INHERIT A SPOTLESS NAME A PROSPEROUS BUSINESS; AS A HUSBAND THE RIGHT TO BE CARED FOR SURROUNDED WITH TENDER AFFECTION; AS A FATHER THE RIGHT TO BE VENERATED; AS A LEADER THE RIGHT TO BE OBEYED WITHOUT A MURMUR. FOR A RIGHT IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE OTHER ASPECT OF DUTY. HIS EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS (TODAY THE PACÔMES ARE THE RICHEST FAMILY IN BOUVILLE) COULD NEVER HAVE SURPRISED HIM. HE NEVER TOLD HIMSELF HE WAS HAPPY AND WHILE HE WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE DONE SO WITH MODERATION SAYING: “THIS IS MY REFRESHMENT.” THUS PLEASURE ITSELF ALSO BECOMING A RIGHT LOST ITS AGGRESSIVE FUTILITY. ON THE LEFT A LITTLE ABOVE HIS BLUISH-GREY HAIR I NOTICED A SHELF OF BOOKS. THE BINDINGS WERE HANDSOME; THEY WERE SURELY CLASSICS. EVERY EVENING BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP PACÔME UNDOUBTEDLY READ OVER A FEW PAGES OF “HIS OLD MONTAIGNE” OR ONE OF HORACE’S ODES IN THE LATIN TEXT. SOMETIMES TOO HE MUST HAVE READ A CONTEMPORARY WORK TO KEEP UP TO DATE. THUS HE KNEW BARRÈS AND BOURGET. HE WOULD PUT HIS BOOK DOWN AFTER A MOMENT. HE WOULD SMILE. HIS LOOK LOSING ITS ADMIRABLE CIRCUMSPECTION BECAME ALMOST DREAMY. HE WOULD SAY: “HOW EASY AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO ONE’S DUTY.”

HE HAD NEVER LOOKED ANY FURTHER INTO HIMSELF: HE WAS A LEADER.

THERE WERE OTHER LEADERS ON THE WALLS: NOTHING BUT LEADERS. HE WAS A LEADER—THIS TALL VER-DE-GRIS MAN IN HIS ARMCHAIR. HIS WHITE WAISTCOAT WAS A HAPPY REMINDER OF HIS SILVER HAIR. (ATTENTION TO ARTISTRY WAS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THESE PORTRAITS WHICH WERE ABOVE ALL PAINTED FOR MORAL EDIFICATION AND EXACTITUDE WAS PUSHED TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT OF SCRUPLE.) HIS LONG SLENDER HAND WAS PLACED ON THE HEAD OF A SMALL BOY. AN OPEN BOOK RESTED ON HIS KNEES WHICH WERE COVERED BY A RUG. BUT HIS LOOK HAD STRAYED INTO THE DISTANCE. HE WAS SEEING ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE INVISIBLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE. HIS NAME WAS WRITTEN ON A PLAQUE OF GILDED WOOD BELOW HIS PORTRAIT: HIS NAME MUST HAVE BEEN PACÔME OR PARROTTIN OR CHAIGNEAU. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF LOOKING: FOR HIS CLOSE RELATIVES FOR THIS CHILD FOR HIMSELF HE WAS SIMPLY THE GRANDFATHER; SOON IF HE DEEMED THE TIME FITTING TO INSTRUCT HIS GRANDSON ABOUT THE SCOPE OF HIS FUTURE DUTIES HE WOULD SPEAK OF HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON:

“YOU’RE GOING TO PROMISE YOUR GRANDFATHER TO BE GOOD MY BOY TO WORK HARD NEXT YEAR. PERHAPS GRANDFATHER WON’T BE HERE ANY MORE NEXT YEAR.”

IN THE EVENING OF HIS LIFE HE SCATTERED HIS INDULGENT GOODNESS OVER EVERYONE. EVEN IF HE WERE TO SEE ME—THOUGH TO HIM I WAS TRANSPARENT—I WOULD FIND GRACE IN HIS EYES: HE WOULD THINK THAT I TOO HAD GRANDPARENTS ONCE. HE DEMANDED NOTHING: ONE HAS NO MORE DESIRES AT THAT AGE. NOTHING EXCEPT FOR PEOPLE TO LOWER THEIR VOICES SLIGHTLY WHEN HE ENTERED NOTHING EXCEPT A TOUCH OF TENDERNESS AND SMILING RESPECT WHEN HE PASSED NOTHING EXCEPT FOR HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TO SAY SOMETIMES: “FATHER IS AMAZING; HE’S YOUNGER THAN ALL OF US”; NOTHING EXCEPT TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO CALM THE TEMPER OF HIS GRANDSON BY PUTTING HIS HANDS ON THE BOY’S HEAD AND SAYING: “GRANDFATHER KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE TROUBLES”; NOTHING EXCEPT FOR HIS SON SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR TO COME ASKING HIS ADVICE ON DELICATE MATTERS; FINALLY NOTHING MORE THAN TO FEEL HIMSELF SERENE APPEASED AND INFINITELY WISE. THE OLD GENTLEMAN’S HAND BARELY WEIGHED ON HIS GRANDSON’S CURLS: IT WAS ALMOST A BENEDICTION. WHAT COULD HE BE THINKING OF? OF HIS HONOURABLE PAST WHICH CONFERRED ON HIM THE RIGHT TO SPEAK ON EVERYTHING AND TO HAVE THE LAST WORD ON EVERYTHING. I HAD NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH THE OTHER DAY: EXPERIENCE WAS MUCH MORE THAN A DEFENCE AGAINST DEATH; IT WAS A RIGHT; THE RIGHT OF OLD MEN.

GENERAL AUBRY HANGING AGAINST THE MOULDING WITH HIS GREAT SABRE WAS A LEADER. ANOTHER LEADER: PRESIDENT HÉBERT WELL READ FRIEND OF IMPÉTRAZ. HIS FACE WAS LONG AND SYMMETRICAL WITH AN INTERMINABLE CHIN PUNCTUATED JUST UNDER THE LIP BY A GOATEE: HE THRUST OUT HIS JAW SLIGHTLY WITH THE AMUSED AIR OF BEING DISTINGUISHED OF ROLLING OUT AN OBJECTION ON PRINCIPLES LIKE A FAINT BELCH. HE DREAMED HE HELD A QUILL PEN: HE WAS TAKING HIS RELAXATION TOO BY HEAVEN AND IT WAS WRITING VERSES. BUT HE HAD THE EAGLE EYE OF A LEADER.

AND SOLDIERS? I WAS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM THE CYNOSURE OF ALL THESE GRAVE EYES. I WAS NEITHER FATHER NOR GRANDFATHER NOT EVEN A HUSBAND. I DID NOT HAVE A VOTE I HARDLY PAID ANY TAXES: I COULD NOT BOAST OF BEING A TAXPAYER AN ELECTOR NOR EVEN OF HAVING THE HUMBLE RIGHT TO HONOUR WHICH TWENTY YEARS OF OBEDIENCE CONFERS ON AN EMPLOYEE. MY EXISTENCE BEGAN TO WORRY ME SERIOUSLY. WAS I NOT A SIMPLE SPECTRE? “HEY!” I SUDDENLY TOLD MYSELF “I AM THE SOLDIER!” IT REALLY MADE ME LAUGH.

A PORTLY QUINQUAGENARIAN POLITELY RETURNED A HANDSOME SMILE. RENAUDAS HAD PAINTED HIM WITH LOVING CARE NO TOUCH WAS TOO TENDER FOR THOSE FLESHY FINELY-CHISELLED LITTLE EARS ESPECIALLY FOR THE HANDS LONG NERVOUS WITH LOOSE FINGERS: THE HANDS OF A REAL SAVANT OR ARTIST. HIS FACE WAS UNKNOWN TO ME: I MUST HAVE PASSED BEFORE THE CANVAS OFTEN WITHOUT NOTICING IT. I WENT UP TO IT AND READ: RÉMY PARROTTIN BORN IN BOUVILLE IN 1849 PROFESSOR AT THE ECOLE DE MÉDECINE PARIS.

PARROTTIN: DOCTOR WAKEFIELD HAD SPOKEN TO ME OF HIM: “ONCE IN MY LIFE I MET A GREAT MAN RÉMY PARROTTIN. I TOOK COURSES UNDER HIM DURING THE WINTER OF 1904 (YOU KNOW I SPENT TWO YEARS IN PARIS STUDYING OBSTETRICS). HE MADE ME REALIZE WHAT IT WAS TO BE A LEADER. HE HAD IT IN HIM I SWEAR HE DID. HE ELECTRIFIED US HE COULD HAVE LED US TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. AND WITH ALL THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN: HE HAD AN IMMENSE FORTUNE—GAVE A GOOD PART OF IT TO HELP POOR STUDENTS.”

THIS IS HOW THIS PRINCE OF SCIENCE THE FIRST TIME I HEARD HIM SPOKEN OF INSPIRED STRONG FEELINGS IN ME. NOW I STOOD BEFORE HIM AND HE WAS SMILING AT ME. WHAT INTELLIGENCE AND AFFABILITY IN HIS SMILE! HIS PLUMP BODY RESTED LEISURELY IN THE HOLLOW OF A GREAT LEATHER ARMCHAIR. THIS UNPRETENTIOUS WISE MAN PUT PEOPLE AT THEIR EASE IMMEDIATELY. IF IT HADN’T BEEN FOR THE SPIRIT IN HIS LOOK YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FOR JUST ANYBODY.

IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO GUESS THE REASON FOR HIS PRESTIGE: HE WAS LOVED BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING; YOU COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING. HE LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE RENAN ALL IN ALL WITH MORE DISTINCTION. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO SAY:

“SOCIALISTS? WELL I GO FURTHER THAN THEY DO!” WHEN YOU FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THIS PERILOUS ROAD YOU WERE SOON TO LEAVE BEHIND NOT WITHOUT A SHIVER FAMILY COUNTRY PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE MOST SACRED VALUES. YOU EVEN DOUBTED FOR A SECOND THE RIGHT OF THE BOURGEOIS ÉLITE TO COMMAND. ANOTHER STEP AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS RE-ESTABLISHED MIRACULOUSLY FOUNDED ON SOLID REASON GOOD OLD REASONS. YOU TURNED AROUND AND SAW THE SOCIALISTS ALREADY FAR BEHIND YOU ALL TINY WAVING THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS AND SHOUTING: “WAIT FOR US!”

THROUGH WAKEFIELD I KNEW THAT THE MASTER LIKED AS HE HIMSELF SAID WITH A SMILE “TO DELIVER SOULS.” TO PROLONG HIS OWN HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH YOUTH: HE OFTEN RECEIVED YOUNG MEN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO WERE STUDYING MEDICINE. WAKEFIELD HAD OFTEN BEEN TO HIS HOUSE FOR LUNCHEON. AFTER THE MEAL THEY RETIRED TO THE SMOKING-ROOM. THE MASTER TREATED THESE STUDENTS WHO WERE AT THEIR FIRST CIGARETTES LIKE MEN: HE OFFERED THEM CIGARS. HE STRETCHED OUT ON A DIVAN AND DISCOURSED AT GREAT LENGTH HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED SURROUNDED BY AN EAGER CROWD OF DISCIPLES. HE EVOKED MEMORIES TOLD STORIES DRAWING A SHARP AND PROFOUND MORAL FROM EACH. AND IF THERE WERE AMONG THOSE WELL-BRED YOUNG MEN ONE WHO SEEMED ESPECIALLY HEADSTRONG PARROTTIN WOULD TAKE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN HIM. HE MADE HIM SPEAK LISTENED TO HIM ATTENTIVELY GAVE HIM IDEAS AND SUBJECTS FOR MEDITATION. IT USUALLY HAPPENED THAT ONE DAY THE YOUNG MAN FULL OF GENEROUS IDEAS EXCITED BY THE HOSTILITY OF HIS PARENTS WEARY OF THINKING ALONE HIS HAND AGAINST EVERY MAN ASKED TO VISIT THE MASTER PRIVATELY AND STAMMERING WITH SHYNESS CONFIDED IN HIM HIS MOST INTIMATE THOUGHTS HIS INDIGNATIONS HIS HOPES. PARROTTIN EMBRACED HIM. HE SAID: “I UNDERSTAND YOU. I UNDERSTOOD YOU FROM THE FIRST DAY.” THEY TALKED ON. PARROTTIN WENT FAR STILL FARTHER SO FAR THAT THE YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED HIM WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY. AFTER A FEW CONVERSATIONS OF THIS SORT ONE COULD DETECT A FAVOURABLE CHANGE IN THE YOUNG REBEL. HE SAW CLEARLY WITHIN HIMSELF HE LEARNED TO KNOW THE DEEP BONDS WHICH ATTACHED HIM TO HIS FAMILY TO HIS ENVIRONMENT; AT LAST HE UNDERSTOOD THE ADMIRABLE ROLE OF THE ÉLITE. AND FINALLY AS IF BY MAGIC FOUND HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN ENLIGHTENED REPENTANT. “HE CURED MORE SOULS” CONCLUDED WAKEFIELD “THAN I’VE CURED BODIES.”

RÉMY PARROTTIN SMILED AFFABLY AT ME. HE HESITATED TRIED TO UNDERSTAND MY POSITION TO TURN GENTLY AND LEAD ME BACK TO THE FOLD. BUT I WASN’T AFRAID OF HIM: I WAS NO LAMB. I LOOKED AT HIS FINE FOREHEAD CALM AND UNWRINKLED HIS SMALL BELLY HIS HAND SET FLAT AGAINST HIS KNEE. I RETURNED HIS SMILE AND LEFT.

JEAN PARROTTIN HIS BROTHER PRESIDENT OF THE S.A.B. LEANED BOTH HANDS ON THE EDGE OF A TABLE LOADED WITH PAPERS; HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE SIGNIFIED TO THE VISITOR THAT THE AUDIENCE WAS OVER. HIS LOOK WAS EXTRAORDINARY; ALTHOUGH ABSTRACTED YET SHINING WITH HIGH ENDEAVOUR. HIS DAZZLING EYES DEVOURED HIS WHOLE FACE. BEHIND THIS GLOW I NOTICED THE THIN TIGHT LIPS OF A MYSTIC. “IT’S ODD” I SAID “HE LOOKS LIKE RÉMY PARROTTIN.” I TURNED TO THE GREAT MASTER: EXAMINING HIM IN THE LIGHT OF THIS RESEMBLANCE A SENSE OF ARIDITY AND DESOLATION A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS FACE. I WENT BACK TO JEAN PARROTTIN.

THIS MAN WAS ONE-IDEAED. NOTHING MORE WAS LEFT IN HIM BUT BONES DEAD FLESH AND PURE RIGHT. A REAL CASE OF POSSESSION I THOUGHT. ONCE RIGHT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF A MAN EXORCISM CANNOT DRIVE IT OUT; JEAN PARROTTIN HAD CONSECRATED HIS WHOLE LIFE TO THINKING ABOUT HIS RIGHT: NOTHING ELSE. INSTEAD OF THE SLIGHT HEADACHE I FEEL COMING ON EACH TIME I VISIT A MUSEUM HE WOULD HAVE FELT THE PAINFUL RIGHT OF HAVING HIS TEMPLES CARED FOR. IT NEVER DID TO MAKE HIM THINK TOO MUCH OR ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TO UNPLEASANT REALITIES TO HIS POSSIBLE DEATH TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS. UNDOUBTEDLY ON HIS DEATH BED AT THAT MOMENT WHEN EVER SINCE SOCRATES IT HAS BEEN PROPER TO PRONOUNCE CERTAIN ELEVATED WORDS HE TOLD HIS WIFE AS ONE OF MY UNCLES TOLD HIS WHO HAD WATCHED BESIDE HIM FOR TWELVE NIGHTS “I DO NOT THANK YOU THÉRÈSE; YOU HAVE ONLY DONE YOUR DUTY.” WHEN A MAN GETS THAT FAR YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAT OFF TO HIM.

HIS EYES WHICH I STARED AT IN WONDERMENT INDICATED THAT I MUST LEAVE. I DID NOT LEAVE. I WAS RESOLUTELY INDISCREET. I KNEW AS A RESULT OF STUDYING AT GREAT LENGTH A CERTAIN PORTRAIT OF PHILIP II IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ESCURIAL THAT WHEN ONE IS CONFRONTED WITH A FACE SPARKLING WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AFTER A MOMENT THIS SPARKLE DIES AWAY AND ONLY AN ASHY RESIDUE REMAINS: THIS RESIDUE INTERESTED ME.

PARROTTIN PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT. BUT SUDDENLY HIS LOOK BURNED OUT THE PICTURE GREW DIM. WHAT WAS LEFT? BLIND EYES THE THIN MOUTH OF A DEAD SNAKE AND CHEEKS. THE PALE ROUND CHEEKS OF A CHILD: THEY SPREAD OVER THE CANVAS. THE EMPLOYEES OF THE S.A.B. NEVER SUSPECTED IT: THEY NEVER STAYED IN PARROTTIN’S OFFICE LONG ENOUGH. WHEN THEY WENT IN THEY CAME UP AGAINST THAT TERRIBLE LOOK LIKE A WALL. FROM BEHIND IT THE CHEEKS WERE IN SHELTER WHITE AND FLABBY. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE HIS WIFE TO NOTICE THEM? TWO YEARS? FIVE YEARS? ONE DAY I IMAGINE AS HER HUSBAND WAS SLEEPING ON HIS SIDE WITH A RAY OF LIGHT CARESSING HIS NOSE OR ELSE ON A HOT DAY WHILE HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS DIGESTION SUNK INTO AN ARMCHAIR HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED WITH A SPLASH OF SUNLIGHT ON HIS CHIN SHE DARED TO LOOK HIM IN THE FACE: ALL THIS FLESH APPEARED TO HER DEFENCELESS BLOATED SLOBBERING VAGUELY OBSCENE. FROM THAT DAY ON MME PARROTTIN UNDOUBTEDLY TOOK COMMAND.

I TOOK A FEW STEPS BACKWARD AND IN ONE GLANCE COVERED ALL THESE GREAT PERSONAGES: PACÔME PRESIDENT HÉBERT BOTH PARROTTINS AND GENERAL AUBRY. THEY HAD WORN TOP HATS; EVERY SUNDAY ON THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE THEY MET MME GRATIEN THE MAYOR’S WIFE WHO SAW SAINTE CÉCILE IN A DREAM. THEY GREETED HER WITH GREAT CEREMONIOUS SALUTES THE SECRET OF WHICH IS NOW LOST.

THEY HAD BEEN PAINTED VERY MINUTELY; YET UNDER THE BRUSH THEIR COUNTENANCES HAD BEEN STRIPPED OF THE MYSTERIOUS WEAKNESS OF MEN’S FACES. THEIR FACES EVEN THE LAST POWERFUL WERE CLEAR AS PORCELAIN: IN VAIN I LOOKED FOR SOME RELATION THEY COULD BEAR TO TREES AND ANIMALS TO THOUGHTS OF EARTH OR WATER. IN LIFE THEY EVIDENTLY DID NOT REQUIRE IT. BUT AT THE MOMENT OF PASSING ON TO POSTERITY THEY HAD CONFIDED THEMSELVES TO A RENOWNED PAINTER IN ORDER THAT HE SHOULD DISCREETLY CARRY OUT ON THEIR FACES THE SYSTEM OF DREDGINGS DRILLINGS AND IRRIGATIONS BY WHICH ALL AROUND BOUVILLE THEY HAD TRANSFORMED THE SEA AND THE LAND. THUS WITH THE HELP OF RENAUDAS AND BORDURIN THEY HAD ENSLAVED NATURE: WITHOUT THEMSELVES AND WITHIN THEMSELVES. WHAT THESE SOMBRE CANVASES OFFERED TO ME WAS MAN RECONSIDERED BY MAN WITH AS SOLE ADORNMENT THE FINEST CONQUEST OF MAN: A BOUQUET OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND CITIZEN. WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION I ADMIRED THE REIGN OF MAN.

A WOMAN AND A MAN CAME IN. THEY WERE DRESSED IN BLACK AND TRIED TO MAKE THEMSELVES INCONSPICUOUS. THEY STOPPED ENCHANTED ON THE DOORSTEP AND THE MAN AUTOMATICALLY TOOK OFF HIS HAT.

“AH!” THE LADY SAID DEEPLY TOUCHED.

THE GENTLEMAN QUICKLY REGAINED HIS SANG-FROID. HE SAID RESPECTFULLY:

“IT’S A WHOLE ERA!”

“YES” THE LADY SAID “THIS IS IN THE TIME OF MY GRANDMOTHER.”

THEY TOOK A FEW STEPS AND MET THE LOOK OF JEAN PARROTTIN. THE WOMAN STOOD GAPING BUT THE MAN WAS NOT PROUD: HE LOOKED HUMBLE HE MUST HAVE KNOWN INTIMIDATING LOOKS AND BRIEF INTERVIEWS WELL. HE TUGGED GENTLY AT THE WOMAN’S ARM.

“LOOK AT THAT ONE” HE SAID.

RÉMY PARROTTIN’S SMILE HAD ALWAYS PUT THE HUMBLE AT EASE. THE WOMAN WENT FORWARD AND READ STUDIOUSLY:

“PORTRAIT OF RÉMY PARROTTIN BORN IN BOUVILLE IN 1849. PROFESSOR OF THE ECOLE DE MÉDECINE PARIS BY RENAUDAS.”

“PARROTTIN OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE” HER HUSBAND SAID “BY RENAUDAS OF THE INSTITUTE. THAT’S HISTORY!”

THE LADY NODDED THEN LOOKED AT THE GREAT MASTER.

“HOW HANDSOME HE IS” SHE SAID “HOW INTELLIGENT HE LOOKS!”

THE HUSBAND MADE AN EXPANSIVE GESTURE.

“THEY’RE THE ONES WHO MADE BOUVILLE WHAT IT IS” HE SAID WITH SIMPLICITY.

“IT’S RIGHT TO HAVE HAD THEM PUT HERE ALL TOGETHER” THE WOMAN SAID TENDERLY.

WE WERE THREE SOLDIERS MANOEUVRING IN THIS IMMENSE HALL. THE HUSBAND WHO LAUGHED WITH RESPECT SILENTLY SHOT ME A TROUBLED GLANCE AND SUDDENLY STOPPED LAUGHING. A SWEET JOY FLOODED OVER ME: WELL I WAS RIGHT! IT WAS REALLY TOO FUNNY.

THE WOMAN CAME NEAR ME.

“GASTON” SHE SAID SUDDENLY BOLD “COME HERE!”

THE HUSBAND CAME TOWARDS US.

“LOOK” SHE WENT ON “HE HAS A STREET NAMED AFTER HIM: OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE. YOU KNOW THE LITTLE STREET THAT GOES UP THE COTEAU VERT JUST BEFORE YOU GET TO JOUXTEBOUVILLE.”

AFTER AN INSTANT SHE ADDED:

“HE DOESN’T LOOK EXACTLY EASY.”

“NO. SOME PEOPLE MUST HAVE FOUND HIM A PRETTY AWKWARD CUSTOMER.”

THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO ME. THE MAN WATCHING ME OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE BEGAN TO LAUGH SOFTLY THIS TIME WITH A CONCEITED AIR A BUSY-BODY AS IF HE WERE OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE HIMSELF.

OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE DID NOT LAUGH. HE THRUST HIS COMPACT JAW TOWARDS US AND HIS ADAM’S APPLE JUTTED OUT.

THERE WAS A MOMENT OF ECSTATIC SILENCE.

“YOU’D THINK HE WAS GOING TO MOVE” THE LADY SAID.

THE HUSBAND EXPLAINED OBLIGINGLY:

“HE WAS A GREAT COTTON MERCHANT. THEN HE WENT INTO POLITICS; HE WAS A DEPUTY.”

I KNEW IT. TWO YEARS AGO I HAD LOOKED HIM UP IN THE PETIT DICTIONNAIRE DES GRANDS HOMMES DE BOUVILLE BY ABBÉ MORELLET. I COPIED THE ARTICLE.

“BLÉVIGNE OLIVIER-MARTIAL SON OF THE LATE OLIVIER-MARTIAL BLÉVIGNE BORN AND DIED IN BOUVILLE (1849–1908) STUDIED LAW IN PARIS PASSED BAR EXAMINATIONS IN 1872. DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE COMMUNE INSURRECTION WHICH FORCED HIM AS IT DID SO MANY OTHER PARISIANS TO TAKE REFUGE IN VERSAILLES UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HE SWORE AT AN AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN THINK ONLY OF PLEASURE ‘TO CONSECRATE HIS LIFE TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER.’ HE KEPT HIS WORD: IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN TO OUR CITY HE FOUNDED THE FAMOUS CLUB DE L’ORDRE WHICH EVERY EVENING FOR MANY YEARS UNITED THE PRINCIPAL BUSINESSMEN AND SHIPOWNERS OF BOUVILLE. THIS ARISTOCRATIC CIRCLE WHICH ONE MIGHT JOKINGLY DESCRIBE AS BEING MORE RESTRICTED THAN THE JOCKEY CLUB EXERTED UNTIL 1908 A SALUTARY INFLUENCE ON THE DESTINY OF OUR GREAT COMMERCIAL PORT. IN 1880 OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE MARRIED MARIE-LOUISE PACOME YOUNGER DAUGHTER OF CHARLES PACARNE BUSINESSMAN (SEE PACÔME) AND AT THE DEATH OF THE LATTER FOUNDED THE COMPANY OF PACÔME-BLÉVIGNE & SON. SHORTLY THEREAFTER HE ENTERED ACTIVELY INTO POLITICS AND PLACED HIS CANDIDATURE BEFORE THE DEPUTATION.

“‘THE COUNTRY’ HE SAID IN A CELEBRATED SPEECH ‘IS SUFFERING FROM A MOST SERIOUS MALADY: THE RULING CLASS NO LONGER WANTS TO RULE. AND WHO THEN SHALL RULE GENTLEMEN IF THOSE WHO BY THEIR HEREDITY THEIR EDUCATION THEIR EXPERIENCE HAVE HEEN RENDERED MOST FIT FOR THE EXERCISING OF POWER TURN FROM IT IN RESIGNATION OR WEARINESS? I HAVE OFTEN SAID: TO RULE IS NOT A RIGHT OF THE ÉLITE; IT IS A PRIMARY DUTY OF THE ÉLITE. GENTLEMEN I BEG OF YOU: LET US RESTORE THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY!’

“ELECTED FIRST ON OCTOBER 4 1885 HE WAS CONSTANTLY REELECTED THEREAFTER. OF AN ENERGETIC AND VIRILE ELOQUENCE HE DELIVERED MANY BRILLIANT SPEECHES. HE WAS IN PARIS IN 1898 WHEN THE TERRIBLE STRIKE BROKE OUT. HE RETURNED TO BOUVILLE IMMEDIATELY AND BECAME THE GUIDING SPIRIT OF THE RESISTANCE. HE TOOK THE INITIATIVE OF NEGOTIATING WITH THE STRIKERS. THESE NEGOTIATIONS INSPIRED BY AN OPEN-MINDED ATTEMPT AT CONCILIATION WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SMALL UPRISING IN JOUXTEBOUVILLE. WE KNOW THAT THE TIMELY INTERVENTION OF THE MILITARY RESTORED CALM TO OUR MINDS.

“THE PREMATURE DEATH OF HIS SON OCTAVE WHO HAD ENTERED THE ECOLE POLY TECHNIQUE AT A VERY EARLY AGE AND OF WHOM HE WANTED TO ‘MAKE A LEADER’ WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE. HE WAS NEVER TO RECOVER FROM IT AND DIED TWO YEARS LATER IN FEBRUARY1908.

“COLLECTED SPEECHES: MORAL FORCES (1894: OUT OF PRINT) THE DUTY TO PUNISH (1900: ALL SPEECHES IN THIS COLLECTION WERE GIVEN À PROPOS OF THE DREYFUS CASE: OUT OF PRINT) WILL-POWER (1902: OUT OF PRINT). AFTER HIS DEATH HIS LAST SPEECHES AND A FEW LETTERS TO INTIMATE FRIENDS WERE COLLECTED UNDER THE TITLE LABOUR IMPROBUS (PLOW 1910). ICONOGRAPHY: THERE IS AN EXCELLENT PORTRAIT OF HIM BY BORDURIN AT THE BOUVILLE MUSEUM.”

AN EXCELLENT PORTRAIT GRANTED. OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE HAD A SMALL BLACK MOUSTACHE AND HIS OLIVE-TINTED FACE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED MAURICE BARRÈS. THE TWO MEN HAD SURELY MET EACH OTHER: THEY USED TO SIT ON THE SAME BENCHES. BUT THE DEPUTY FROM BOUVILLE DID NOT HAVE THE NONCHALANCE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF PATRIOTS. HE WAS STIFF AS A POKER AND SPRANG AT YOU FROM HIS CANVAS LIKE A JACK-IN-THE-BOX. HIS EYES SPARKLED: THE PUPIL WAS BLACK THE CORNEA REDDISH. HE PURSED UP HIS FLESHY LITTLE MOUTH AND HELD HIS RIGHT HAND AGAINST HIS BREAST.

HOW THIS PORTRAIT ANNOYED ME! SOMETIMES BLÉVIGNE SEEMED TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL TO ME. BUT TODAY I KNEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

I HAD LEARNED THE TRUTH TURNING OVER THE PAGES OF THE SATIRIQUE BOUVILLOIS. THE ISSUE OF 6 NOVEMBER 1905 WAS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO BLÉVIGNE. HE WAS PICTURED ON THE COVER TINY HANGING ON TO THE MANE OF OLD COMBES AND THE CAPTION READ: “THE LION’S LOUSE.” EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED FROM THE FIRST PAGE ON: OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE WAS ONLY FIVE FEET TALL. THEY MOCKED HIS SMALL STATURE AND SQUEAKING VOICE WHICH MORE THAN ONCE THREW THE WHOLE CHAMBER INTO HYSTERICS. THEY ACCUSED HIM OF PUTTING RUBBER LIFTS IN HIS SHOES. ON THE OTHER HAND MME BLÉVIGNE NÉE PACÔME WAS A HORSE. “HERE WE CAN WELL SAY” THE PAPER ADDED “THAT HIS OTHER HALF IS HIS DOUBLE.”

FIVE FEET TALL! YES BORDURIN WITH JEALOUS CARE HAD SURROUNDED HIM WITH OBJECTS WHICH RAN NO RISK OF DIMINISHING HIM; A HASSOCK A LOW ARMCHAIR A SHELF WITH A FEW LITTLE BOOKS A SMALL PERSIAN TABLE. ONLY HE HAD GIVEN HIM THE SAME STATURE AS HIS NEIGHBOUR JEAN PARROTTIN AND BOTH CANVASES HAD THE SAME DIMENSIONS. THE RESULT WAS THAT THE SMALL TABLE IN ONE PICTURE WAS ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE IMMENSE TABLE IN THE OTHER AND THAT THE HASSOCK WOULD HAVE ALMOST REACHED PARROTTIN’S SHOULDER. THE EYE INSTINCTIVELY MADE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO: MY DISCOMFORT HAD COME FROM THAT.

NOW I WANTED TO LAUGH. FIVE FEET TALL! IF I HAD WANTED TO TALK TO BLÉVIGNE I WOULD HAVE HAD TO LEAN OVER OR BEND MY KNEES. I WAS NO LONGER SURPRISED THAT HE HELD UP HIS NOSE SO IMPETUOUSLY: THE DESTINY OF THESE SMALL MEN IS ALWAYS WORKING ITSELF OUT A FEW INCHES ABOVE THEIR HEAD.

ADMIRABLE POWER OF ART. FROM THIS SHRILL-VOICED MANNIKIN NOTHING WOULD PASS ON TO POSTERITY SAVE A THREATENING FACE A SUPERB GESTURE AND THE BLOODSHOT EYES OF A BULL. THE STUDENT TERRORISED BY THE COMMUNE THE DEPUTY A BAD-TEMPERED MIDGET; THAT WAS WHAT DEATH HAD TAKEN. BUT THANKS TO BORDURIN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CLUB DE L’ORDRE THE ORATOR OF “MORAL FORCES” WAS IMMORTAL.

“OH POOR LITTLE PIPO!”

THE WOMAN GAVE A STIFLED CRY: UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF OCTAVE BLÉVIGNE “SON OF THE LATE . . .” A PIOUS HAND HAD TRACED THESE WORDS:

“DIED AT THE ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE IN 1904.”

“HE’S DEAD! JUST LIKE THE ARONDEL BOY. HE LOOKED INTELLIGENT. HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR HIS POOR MOTHER! THEY MAKE THEM WORK TOO HARD IN THOSE BIG SCHOOLS. THE BRAIN WORKS WHILE YOU’RE ASLEEP. I LIKE THOSE TWO-CORNERED HATS IT LOOKS SO STYLISH. IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL A CASSOWARY?’”

“NO. THEY HAVE CASSOWARIES AT SAINT-CYR.”

IN MY TURN I STUDIED THE PREMATURELY DEAD POLYTECHNICIAN. HIS WAX COMPLEXION AND WELL-GROOMED MOUSTACHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO TURN ONE’S IDEA TO APPROACHING DEATH. HE HAD FORESEEN HIS FATE AS WELL: A CERTAIN RESIGNATION COULD BE READ IN HIS CLEAR FAR-SEEING EYES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CARRIED HIS HEAD HIGH; IN THIS UNIFORM HE REPRESENTED THE FRENCH ARMY.

TU MARCELLUS ERIS! MANIBUS DATE LILIA PLENIS. . .

A CUT ROSE A DEAD POLYTECHNICIAN: WHAT COULD BE SADDER?

I QUIETLY FOLLOWED THE LONG GALLERY GREETING IN PASSING WITHOUT STOPPING THE DISTINGUISHED FACES WHICH PEERED FROM THE SHADOWS: M. BOSSOIRE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE; M. FABY PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE AUTONOMOUS PORT OF BOUVILLE; M. BOULANGE BUSINESSMAN WITH HIS FAMILY; M. RANNEQUIN MAYOR OF BOUVILLE; M. DE LUCIEN BORN IN BOUVILLE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES AND A POET AS WELL; AN UNKNOWN DRESSED LIKE A PREFECT; MOTHER SAINTE-MARIE-LOUISE MOTHER SUPERIOR OF THE ORPHAN ASYLUM; M. AND MME THÉRÉSON; M. THIBOUST-GOURON GENERAL PRESIDENT OF THE TRADES COUNCIL; M. BOBOT PRINCIPLE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INSCRIPTION MARITIME; MESSRS. BRION MINETTE GRELOT LEFÈBVRE DR. AND MME PAIN BORDURIN HIMSELF PAINTED BY HIS SON PIERRE BORDURIN. CLEAR COLD LOOKS FINE FEATURES THIN LIPS M. BOULANGE WAS ECONOMICAL AND PATIENT MOTHER SAINTE-MARIE-LOUISE OF AN INDUSTRIOUS PIETY M. THIBOUST-GOURON WAS AS HARD ON HIMSELF AS ON OTHERS. MME THÉRÉSON STRUGGLED WITHOUT WEAKENING AGAINST DEEP ILLNESS. HER INFINITELY WEARY MOUTH TOLD UNCEASINGLY OF HER SUFFERING. BUT THIS PIOUS WOMAN HAD NEVER SAID: “IT HURTS.” SHE TOOK THE UPPER HAND: SHE MADE UP BILLS OF FARE AND PRESIDED OVER WELFARE SOCIETIES. SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SLOWLY CLOSE HER EYES IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE AND ALL TRACES OF LIFE WOULD LEAVE HER FACE. THIS FAINTING SPELL LASTED HARDLY MORE THAN A SECOND; SHORTLY AFTERWARD MME THÉRÉSON WOULD RE-OPEN HER EYES AND FINISH HER SENTENCE. AND IN THE WORK ROOM THEY WHISPERED: “POOR MME THÉRÉSON! SHE NEVER COMPLAINS.”

I HAD CROSSED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE SALON BORDURIN-RENAUDAS. I TURNED BACK. FAREWELL BEAUTIFUL LILIES ELEGANT IN YOUR PAINTED LITTLE SANCTUARIES GOOD-BYE LOVELY LILIES OUR PRIDE AND REASON FOR EXISTING GOOD-BYE YOU BASTARDS!

MONDAY:

I’M NOT WRITING MY BOOK ON ROLLEBON ANY MORE; IT’S FINISHED I CAN’T WRITE ANY MORE OF IT. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE?

IT WAS THREE O’CLOCK. I WAS SITTING AT MY TABLE; I HAD SET BESIDE ME THE FILE OF LETTERS I STOLE IN MOSCOW; I WAS WRITING:

“CARE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SPREAD THE MOST SINISTER RUMOURS. M. DE ROLLEBON MUST HAVE LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN IN BY THIS MANŒUVRE SINCE HE WROTE TO HIS NEPHEW ON THE 13TH OF SEPTEMBER THAT HE HAD JUST MADE HIS WILL.”

THE MARQUIS WAS THERE: WAITING FOR THE MOMENT WHEN I SHOULD HAVE DEFINITIVELY INSTALLED HIM IN A NICHE IN HISTORY I HAD LOANED HIM MY LIFE. I FELT HIM LIKE A GLOW IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH.

I STUDDENLY REALIZED AN OBJECTION SOMEONE MIGHT RAISE: ROLLEBON WAS FAR FROM BEING FRANK WITH HIS NEPHEW WHOM HE WANTED TO USE IF THE PLOT FAILED AS HIS DEFENCE WITNESS WITH PAUL I. IT WAS ONLY TOO POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD MADE UP THE STORY OF THE WILL TO MAKE HIMSELF APPEAR COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

THIS WAS A MINOR OBJECTION; IT WOULDN’T HOLD WATER. BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO PLUNGE ME INTO A BROWN STUDY. SUDDENLY I SAW THE FAT WAITRESS AT “CAMILLE’S” AGAIN THE HAGGARD FACE OF M. ACHILLE THE ROOM IN WHICH I HAD SO CLEARLY FELT I WAS FORGOTTEN FORSAKEN IN THE PRESENT WEARILY I TOLD MYSELF:

HOW CAN I WHO HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO HOLD TO MY OWN PAST HOPE TO SAVE THE PAST OF SOMEONE ELSE?

I PICKED UP MY PEN AND TRIED TO GET BACK TO WORK; I WAS UP TO MY NECK IN THESE REFLECTIONS ON THE PAST THE PRESENT THE WORLD. I ASKED ONLY ONE THING: TO BE ALLOWED TO FINISH MY BOOK IN PEACE.

BUT AS MY EYES FELL ON THE PAD OF WHITE SHEETS I WAS STRUCK BY ITS LOOK AND I STAYED PEN RAISED STUDYING THIS DAZZLING PAPER: SO HARD AND FAR SEEING SO PRESENT. THE LETTERS I HAD JUST INSCRIBED ON IT WERE NOT EVEN DRY YET AND ALREADY THEY BELONGED TO THE PAST.

“CARE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SPREAD THE MOST SINISTER RUMOURS . . .”

I HAD THOUGHT OUT THIS SENTENCE AT FIRST IT HAD BEEN A SMALL PART OF MYSELF. NOW IT WAS INSCRIBED ON THE PAPER IT TOOK SIDES AGAINST ME. I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE IT ANY MORE. I COULDN’T CONCEIVE IT AGAIN. IT WAS THERE IN FRONT OF ME; IN VAIN FOR ME TO TRACE SOME SIGN OF ITS ORIGIN. ANYONE COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT. BUT I . . . I WASN’T SURE I WROTE IT. THE LETTERS GLISTENED NO LONGER THEY WERE DRY. THAT HAD DISAPPEARED TOO; NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT THEIR EPHEMERAL SPARK.

I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND ME: THE PRESENT NOTHING BUT THE PRESENT. FURNITURE LIGHT AND SOLID ROOTED IN ITS PRESENT A TABLE A BED A CLOSET WITH A MIRROR—AND ME. THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PRESENT REVEALED ITSELF: IT WAS WHAT EXISTS AND ALL THAT WAS NOT PRESENT DID NOT EXIST. THE PAST DID NOT EXIST. NOT AT ALL. NOT IN THINGS NOT EVEN IN MY THOUGHTS. IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO THAT MINE HAD ESCAPED ME. BUT UNTIL THEN I BELIEVED THAT IT HAD SIMPLY GONE OUT OF MY RANGE. FOR ME THE PAST WAS ONLY A PENSIONING OFF: IT WAS ANOTHER WAY OF EXISTING A STATE OF VACATION AND INACTION; EACH EVENT WHEN IT HAD PLAYED ITS PART PUT ITSELF POLITELY INTO A BOX AND BECAME AN HONORARY EVENT: WE HAVE SO MUCH DIFFICULTY IMAGINING NOTHINGNESS. NOW I KNEW: THINGS ARE ENTIRELY WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE—AND BEHIND THEM . . . THERE IS NOTHING.

THIS THOUGHT ABSORBED ME A FEW MINUTES LONGER. THEN I VIOLENTLY MOVED MY SHOULDERS TO FREE MYSELF AND PULLED THE PAD OF PAPER TOWARDS ME.

“. . . THAT HE HAD JUST MADE HIS WILL.”

AN IMMENSE SICKNESS FLOODED OVER ME SUDDENLY AND THE PEN FELL FROM MY HAND SPLUTTERING INK. WHAT HAPPENED? DID I HAVE THE NAUSEA? NO IT WASN’T THAT THE ROOM HAD ITS PATERNAL EVERYDAY LOOK. THE TABLE HARDLY SEEMED HEAVIER AND MORE SOLID TO ME NOR MY PEN MORE COMPACT. ONLY M. DE ROLLEBON HAD JUST DIED FOR THE SECOND TIME.

HE WAS STILL THERE INSIDE ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO QUIET AND WARM AND I COULD FEEL HIM STIR FROM TIME TO TIME. HE WAS QUITE ALIVE MORE ALIVE TO ME THAN THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN OR THE WOMAN AT THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS.” HE UNDOUBTEDLY HAD HIS WHIMS HE COULD STAY SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT SHOWING HIMSELF; BUT OFTEN ON A MYSTERIOUSLY FINE DAY LIKE A WEATHER PROPHET HE PUT HIS NOSE OUT AND I COULD SEE HIS PALE FACE AND BLUISH CHEEKS. AND EVEN WHEN HE DIDN’T SHOW HIMSELF HE WAS A WEIGHT ON MY HEART AND I FELT FULL UP.

NOTHING MORE WAS LEFT NOW. NO MORE THAN ON THESE TRACES OF DRY INK IS LEFT THE MEMORY OF THEIR FRESHNESS. IT WAS MY FAULT: I HAD SPOKEN THE ONLY WORDS I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID: I HAD SAID THAT THE PAST DID NOT EXIST. AND SUDDENLY NOISELESS M. DE ROLLEBON HAD RETURNED TO HIS NOTHINGNESS.

I HELD HIS LETTERS IN MY HANDS FELT THEM WITH A KIND OF DESPAIR:

HE IS THE ONE I SAID HE IS THE ONE WHO MADE THESE MARKS ONE BY ONE. HE LEANED ON THIS PAPER HE PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE SHEETS TO PREVENT THEM FROM TURNING UNDER HIS PEN.

TOO LATE: THESE WORDS HAD NO MORE SENSE. NOTHING EXISTED BUT A BUNDLE OF YELLOW PAGES WHICH I CLASPED IN MY HANDS. IT IS TRUE THERE WAS THAT COMPLICATED AFFAIR. ROLLEBON’S NEPHEW ASSASSINATED BY THE CZAR’S POLICE IN 1810 HIS PAPERS CONFISCATED AND TAKEN TO THE SECRET ARCHIVES THEN A HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS LATER DEPOSITED BY THE SOVIETS WHO ACTED FOR HIM IN THE STATE LIBRARY WHERE I STOLE THEM IN 1923. BUT THAT DIDN’T SEEM TRUE AND I HAD NO REAL MEMORY OF A THEFT I HAD COMMITTED MYSELF. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND A HUNDRED MORE CREDIBLE STORIES TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF THESE PAPERS IN MY ROOM: ALL WOULD SEEM HOLLOW AND EPHEMERAL IN FACE OF THESE SCORED SHEETS. RATHER THAN COUNT ON THEM TO PUT ME IN COMMUNICATION WITH ROLLEBON I WOULD DO BETTER TO TAKE UP SPIRIT RAPPING. ROLLEBON WAS NO MORE. NO MORE AT ALL. IF THERE WERE STILL A FEW BONES LEFT OF HIM THEY EXISTED FOR THEMSELVES INDEPENDENTLY THEY WERE NOTHING MORE THAN A LITTLE PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH SALTS AND WATER.

I MADE ONE LAST ATTEMPT; I REPEATED THE WORDS OF MME DE GENLIS BY WHICH I USUALLY EVOKED THE MARQUIS: “HIS SMALL WRINKLED COUNTENANCE CLEAN AND SHARP ALL PITTED WITH SMALLPOX IN WHICH THERE WAS A SINGULAR MALICE WHICH STRUCK THE EYE NO MATTER WHAT EFFORT HE MADE TO DISSEMBLE IT.”

HIS FACE APPEARED TO ME WITH DOCILITY HIS POINTED NOSE HIS BLUISH CHEEKS HIS SMILE. I COULD SHAPE HIS FEATURES AT WILL PERHAPS WITH EVEN GREATER EASE THAN BEFORE. ONLY IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AN IMAGE IN ME A FICTION. I SIGHED LET MYSELF LEAN BACK AGAINST THE CHAIR WITH AN INTOLERABLE SENSE OF LOSS.

FOUR O’CLOCK STRIKES. I’VE BEEN SITTING HERE AN HOUR MY ARMS HANGING. IT’S BEGINNING TO GET DARK. APART FROM THAT NOTHING IN THIS ROOM HAS CHANGED: THE WHITE PAPER IS STILL ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PEN AND INKWELL. BUT I SHALL NEVER WRITE AGAIN ON THIS PAGE ALREADY STARTED. NEVER AGAIN FOLLOWING THE RUE DES MUTILÉS AND THE BOULEVARD DE LA REDOUTE SHALL I TURN INTO THE LIBRARY TO LOOK THROUGH THEIR ARCHIVES.

I WANT TO GET UP AND GO OUT DO ANYTHING—NO MATTER WHAT—TO STUPEFY MYSELF. BUT IF I MOVE ONE FINGER IF I DON’T STAY ABSOLUTELY STILL I KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I DON’T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME YET. IT WILL HAPPEN TOO SOON AS IT IS. I DON’T MOVE; MECHANICALLY I READ THE PARAGRAPH I LEFT UNFINISHED ON THE PAD OF PAPER:

“CARE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO SPREAD THE MOST SINISTER RUMOURS. M. DE ROLLEBON MUST HAVE LET HIMSELF BE CAUGHT BY THIS MANŒUVRE SINCE HE WROTE TO HIS NEPHEW ON THE 13TH OF SEPTEMBER THAT HE HAD JUST MADE HIS WILL.”

THE GREAT ROLLEBON AFFAIR WAS OVER LIKE A GREAT PASSION. I MUST FIND SOMETHING ELSE. A FEW YEARS AGO IN SHANGHAI IN MERCIER’S OFFICE I SUDDENLY WOKE FROM A DREAM. THEN I HAD ANOTHER DREAM I LIVED IN THE CZAR’S COURT IN OLD PALACES SO COLD THAT THE ICICLES FORMED ABOVE THE DOORS IN WINTER. TODAY I WAKE UP IN FRONT OF A PAD OF WHITE PAPER. THE TORCHES THE ICE CARNIVALS THE UNIFORMS THE LOVELY COOL SHOULDERS HAVE DISAPPEARED. SOMETHING HAS STAYED BEHIND IN THIS WARM ROOM SOMETHING I DON’T WANT TO SEE.

M. DE ROLLEBON WAS MY PARTNER; HE NEEDED ME IN ORDER TO EXIST AND I NEEDED HIM SO AS NOT TO FEEL MY EXISTENCE. I FURNISHED THE RAW MATERIAL THE MATERIAL I HAD TO RE-SELL WHICH I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH: EXISTENCE MY EXISTENCE. HIS PART WAS TO HAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE. HE STOOD IN FRONT OF ME TOOK UP MY LIFE TO LAY BARE HIS OWN TO ME. I DID NOT NOTICE THAT I EXISTED ANY MORE I NO LONGER EXISTED IN MYSELF BUT IN HIM; I ATE FOR HIM BREATHED FOR HIM EACH OF MY MOVEMENTS HAD ITS SENSE OUTSIDE THERE JUST IN FRONT OF ME IN HIM; I NO LONGER SAW MY HAND WRITING LETTERS ON THE PAPER NOT EVEN THE SENTENCE I HAD WRITTEN—BUT BEHIND BEYOND THE PAPER I SAW THE MARQUIS WHO HAD CLAIMED THE GESTURE AS HIS OWN THE GESTURE WHICH PROLONGED CONSOLIDATED HIS EXISTENCE. I WAS ONLY A MEANS OF MAKING HIM LIVE HE WAS MY REASON FOR LIVING HE HAD DELIVERED ME FROM MYSELF. WHAT SHALL I DO NOW?

ABOVE ALL NOT MOVE NOT MOVE. . . AH!

I COULD NOT PREVENT THIS MOVEMENT OF THE SHOULDERS . . .

THE THING WHICH WAS WAITING WAS ON THE ALERT IT HAS POUNCED ON ME IT FLOWS THROUGH ME I AM FILLED WITH IT. IT’S NOTHING: I AM THE THING. EXISTENCE LIBERATED DETACHED FLOODS OVER ME. I EXIST.

I EXIST. IT’S SWEET SO SWEET SO SLOW. AND LIGHT: YOU’D THINK IT FLOATED ALL BY ITSELF. IT STIRS. IT BRUSHES BY ME MELTS AND VANISHES. GENTLY GENTLY. THERE IS BUBBLING WATER IN MY MOUTH. I SWALLOW. IT SLIDES DOWN MY THROAT IT CARESSES ME—AND NOW IT COMES UP AGAIN INTO MY MOUTH. FOR EVER I SHALL HAVE A LITTLE POOL OF WHITISH WATER IN MY MOUTH—LYING LOW—GRAZING MY TONGUE. AND THIS POOL IS STILL ME. AND THE TONGUE. AND THE THROAT IS ME.

I SEE MY HAND SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE. IT LIVES—IT IS ME. IT OPENS THE FINGERS OPEN AND POINT. IT IS LYING ON ITS BACK. IT SHOWS ME ITS FAT BELLY. IT LOOKS LIKE AN ANIMAL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THE FINGERS ARE THE PAWS. I AMUSE MYSELF BY MOVING THEM VERY RAPIDLY LIKE THE CLAWS OF A CRAB WHICH HAS FALLEN ON ITS BACK.

THE CRAB IS DEAD: THE CLAWS DRAW UP AND CLOSE OVER THE BELLY OF MY HAND. I SEE THE NAILS—THE ONLY PART OF ME THAT DOESN’T LIVE. AND ONCE MORE. MY HAND TURNS OVER SPREADS OUT FLAT ON ITS STOMACH OFFERS ME THE SIGHT OF ITS BACK. A SILVERY BACK SHINING A LITTLE—LIKE A FISH EXCEPT FOR THE RED HAIRS ON THE KNUCKLES. I FEEL MY HAND. I AM THESE TWO BEASTS STRUGGLING AT THE END OF MY ARMS. MY HAND SCRATCHES ONE OF ITS PAWS WITH THE NAIL OF THE OTHER PAW; I FEEL ITS WEIGHT ON THE TABLE WHICH IS NOT ME. IT’S LONG LONG THIS IMPRESSION OF WEIGHT IT DOESN’T PASS. THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT TO PASS. IT BECOMES INTOLERABLE . . . I DRAW BACK MY HAND AND PUT IT IN MY POCKET; BUT IMMEDIATELY I FEEL THE WARMTH OF MY THIGH THROUGH THE STUFF. I PULL MY HAND OUT OF MY POCKET AND LET IT HANG AGAINST THE BACK OF THE CHAIR. NOW I FEEL A WEIGHT AT THE END OF MY ARM. IT PULLS A LITTLE SOFTLY INSINUATINGLY IT EXISTS. I DON’T INSIST: NO MATTER WHERE I PUT IT IT WILL GO ON EXISTING; I CAN’T SUPPRESS IT NOR CAN I SUPPRESS THE REST OF MY BODY THE SWEATY WARMTH WHICH SOILS MY SHIRT NOR ALL THIS WARM OBESITY WHICH TURNS LAZILY AS IF SOMEONE WERE STIRRING IT WITH A SPOON NOR ALL THE SENSATIONS GOING ON INSIDE GOING COMING MOUNTING FROM MY SIDE TO MY ARMPIT OR QUIETLY VEGETATING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT IN THEIR USUAL CORNER.

I JUMP UP: IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF I COULD ONLY STOP THINKING. THOUGHTS ARE THE DULLEST THINGS. DULLER THAN FLESH. THEY STRETCH OUT AND THERE’S NO END TO THEM AND THEY LEAVE A FUNNY TASTE IN THE MOUTH. THEN THERE ARE WORDS INSIDE THE THOUGHTS UNFINISHED WORDS A SKETCHY SENTENCE WHICH CONSTANTLY RETURNS: “I HAVE TO FI. . . I EX. . . DEAD . . . M. DE ROLL IS DEAD . . . I AM NOT . . . I EX. . .” IT GOES IT GOES . . . AND THERE’S NO END TO IT. IT’S WORSE THAN THE REST BECAUSE I FEEL RESPONSIBLE AND HAVE COMPLICITY IN IT. FOR EXAMPLE THIS SORT OF PAINFUL RUMINATION: I EXIST I AM THE ONE WHO KEEPS IT UP. I. THE BODY LIVES BY ITSELF ONCE IT HAS BEGUN. BUT THOUGHT—I AM THE ONE WHO CONTINUES IT UNROLLS IT. I EXIST. HOW SERPENTINE IS THIS FEELING OF EXISTING—I UNWIND IT SLOWLY. . . . IF I COULD KEEP MYSELF FROM THINKING! I TRY AND SUCCEED: MY HEAD SEEMS TO FILL WITH SMOKE . . . AND THEN IT STARTS AGAIN: “SMOKE . . . NOT TO THINK . . . DON’T WANT TO THINK . . . I THINK I DON’T WANT TO THINK. I MUSTN’T THINK THAT I DON’T WANT TO THINK. BECAUSE THAT’S STILL A THOUGHT.” WILL THERE NEVER BE AN END TO IT?

MY THOUGHT IS ME: THAT’S WHY I CAN’T STOP. I EXIST BECAUSE I THINK . . . AND I CAN’T STOP MYSELF FROM THINKING. AT THIS VERY MOMENT—IT’S FRIGHTFUL—IF I EXIST IT IS BECAUSE I AM HORRIFIED AT EXISTING. I AM THE ONE WHO PULLS MYSELF FROM THE NOTHINGNESS TO WHICH I ASPIRE: THE HATRED THE DISGUST OF EXISTING THERE ARE AS MANY WAYS TO MAKE MYSELF EXIST TO THRUST MYSELF INTO EXISTENCE. THOUGHTS ARE BORN AT THE BACK OF ME LIKE SUDDEN GIDDINESS I FEEL THEM BEING BORN BEHIND MY HEAD . . . IF I YIELD THEY’RE GOING TO COME ROUND IN FRONT OF ME BETWEEN MY EYES—AND I ALWAYS YIELD THE THOUGHT GROWS AND GROWS AND THERE IT IS IMMENSE FILLING ME COMPLETELY AND RENEWING MY EXISTENCE.

MY SALIVA IS SUGARY MY BODY WARM: I FEEL NEUTRAL. MY KNIFE IS ON THE TABLE. I OPEN IT. WHY NOT? IT WOULD BE A CHANGE IN ANY CASE. I PUT MY LEFT HAND ON THE PAD AND STAB THE KNIFE INTO THE PALM. THE MOVEMENT WAS TOO NERVOUS; THE BLADE SLIPPED THE WOUND IS SUPERFICIAL. IT BLEEDS. THEN WHAT? WHAT HAS CHANGED? STILL I WATCH WITH SATISFACTION ON THE WHITE PAPER ACROSS THE LINES I WROTE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THIS TINY POOL OF BLOOD WHICH HAS AT LAST STOPPED BEING ME. FOUR LINES ON A WHITE PAPER A SPOT OF BLOOD THAT MAKES A BEAUTIFUL MEMORY. I MUST WRITE BENEATH IT: “TODAY I GAVE UP WRITING MY BOOK ON THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON.”

AM I GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MY HAND? I WONDER. I WATCH THE SMALL MONOTONOUS TRICKLE OF BLOOD. NOW IT IS COAGULATING. IT’S OVER. MY SKIN LOOKS RUSTY AROUND THE CUT. UNDER THE SKIN THE ONLY THING LEFT IS A SMALL SENSATION EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHERS PERHAPS EVEN MORE INSIPID.

HALF-PAST FIVE STRIKES. I GET UP MY COLD SHIRT STICKS TO MY FLESH. I GO OUT. WHY? WELL BECAUSE I HAVE NO REASON NOT TO. EVEN IF I STAY EVEN IF I CROUCH SILENTLY IN A CORNER I SHALL NOT FORGET MYSELF. I WILL BE THERE MY WEIGHT ON THE FLOOR. I AM.

I BUY A NEWSPAPER ALONG MY WAY. SENSATIONAL NEWS. LITTLE LUCIENNE’S BODY HAS BEEN FOUND! SMELL OF INK THE PAPER CRUMPLES BETWEEN MY FINGERS. THE CRIMINAL HAS FLED. THE CHILD WAS RAPED. THEY FOUND HER BODY THE FINGERS CLAWING AT THE MUD. I ROLL THE PAPER INTO A BALL MY FINGERS CLUTCHING AT THE PAPER; SMELL OF INK; MY GOD HOW STRONGLY THINGS EXIST TODAY. LITTLE LUCIENNE WAS RAPED. STRANGLED. HER BODY STILL EXISTS HER FLESH BLEEDING. SHE NO LONGER EXISTS. HER HANDS. SHE NO LONGER EXISTS. THE HOUSES. I WALK BETWEEN THE HOUSES I AM BETWEEN THE HOUSES ON THE PAVEMENT; THE PAVEMENT UNDER MY FEET EXISTS THE HOUSES CLOSE AROUND ME AS THE WATER CLOSES OVER ME ON THE PAPER THE SHAPE OF A SWAN. I AM. I AM I EXIST I THINK THEREFORE I AM; I AM BECAUSE I THINK WHY DO I THINK? I DON’T WANT TO THINK ANY MORE I AM BECAUSE I THINK THAT I DON’T WANT TO BE I THINK THAT I . . . BECAUSE . . . UGH! I FLEE. THE CRIMINAL HAS FLED THE VIOLATED BODY. SHE FELT THIS OTHER FLESH PUSHING INTO HER OWN. I . . . THERE I . . . RAPED. A SOFT CRIMINAL DESIRE TO RAPE CATCHES ME FROM BEHIND GENTLY BEHIND THE EARS THE EARS RACE BEHIND ME THE RED HAIR IT IS RED ON MY HEAD THE WET GRASS RED GRASS IS IT STILL I? HOLD THE PAPER EXISTENCE AGAINST EXISTENCE THINGS EXIST ONE AGAINST THE OTHER I DROP THE PAPER. THE HOUSE SPRINGS UP IT EXISTS; IN FRONT OF ME ALONG THE WALL I AM PASSING ALONG THE WALL I EXIST IN FRONT OF THE WALL ONE STEP THE WALL EXISTS IN FRONT OF ME ONE TWO BEHIND ME A FINGER SCRATCHING AT MY PANTS SCRATCHES SCRATCHES AND PULLS AT THE LITTLE FINGER SOILED WITH MUD MUD ON MY FINGER WHICH CAME FROM THE MUDDY GUTTER AND FALLS BACK SLOWLY SOFTLY SOFTENING SCRATCHING LESS STRONGLY THAN THE FINGERS OF THE LITTLE GIRL THE CRIMINAL STRANGLED SCRATCHING THE MUD THE EARTH LESS STRONG THE FINGER SLIDES SLOWLY THE HEAD FALLS FIRST AND ROLLING EMBRACES MY THIGH; EXISTENCE IS SOFT AND ROLLS AND TOSSES I TOSS BETWEEN THE HOUSES I AM I EXIST I THINK THEREFORE I TOSS I AM EXISTENCE IS A FALLEN CHUTE WILL NOT FALL WILL FALL THE FINGER SCRATCHES AT THE WINDOW EXISTENCE IS AN IMPERFECTION. THE GENTLEMAN. THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN EXISTS. THE GENTLEMAN FEELS THAT HE EXISTS. NO THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN WHO PASSES PROUD AND GENTLE AS A CONVOLVULUS DOES NOT FEEL THAT HE EXISTS. TO EXPAND; MY CUT HAND HURTS EXIST EXIST EXIST. THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN EXISTS THE LEGION OF HONOUR THE MOUSTACHE EXISTS IT IS ALL; HOW HAPPY ONE MUST BE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN A LEGION OF HONOUR AND A MOUSTACHE AND NO ONE SEES THE REST HE SEES THE TWO POINTED ENDS OF HIS MOUSTACHE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NOSE; I DO NOT THINK THEREFORE I AM A MOUSTACHE. HE SEES NEITHER HIS GAUNT BODY NOR HIS BIG FEET IF YOU LOOKED IN THE CROTCH OF THE TROUSERS YOU WOULD SURELY DISCOVER A PAIR OF LITTLE BALLS. HE HAS THE LEGION OF HONOUR THE BASTARDS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST: “I EXIST BECAUSE IT IS MY RIGHT” I HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST THEREFORE I HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO THINK: THE FINGER IS RAISED. AM I GOING TO . . . CARESS IN THE OPENING OF WHITE SHEETS THE WHITE ECSTATIC FLESH WHICH FALLS BACK GENTLY TOUCH THE BLOSSOMING MOISTURE OF ARMPITS THE ELIXIS AND CORDIALS AND FLORESCENCE OF FLESH ENTER INTO THE EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER INTO THE RED MUCUS WITH THE HEAVY SWEET SWEET ODOUR OF EXISTENCE FEEL MYSELF EXIST BETWEEN THESE SOFT WET LIPS THE LIPS RED WITH PALE BLOOD THROBBING LIPS YAWNING ALL WET WITH EXISTENCE ALL WET WITH CLEAR PUS BETWEEN THE WET SUGARY LIPS WEEPING LIKE EYES?

WHEN THAT YELLOW MOON BEGINS TO BEAM

EVERY NIGHT I DREAM MY LITTLE DREAM.

THE VOICE DEEP AND HOARSE SUDDENLY APPEARS AND THE WORLD VANISHES THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE. A WOMAN IN THE FLESH HAD THIS VOICE SHE SANG IN FRONT OF A RECORD IN HER FINEST GET UP AND THEY RECORDED HER VOICE. THE WOMAN: BAH! SHE EXISTED LIKE ME LIKE ROLLEBON I DON’T WANT TO KNOW HER. BUT THERE IT IS. YOU CAN’T SAY IT EXISTS. THE TURNING RECORD EXISTS THE AIR STRUCK BY THE VOICE WHICH VIBRATES EXISTS THE VOICE WHICH MADE AN IMPRESSION THE RECORD EXISTED. I WHO LISTEN I EXIST. ALL IS FULL EXISTENCE EVERYWHERE DENSE HEAVY AND SWEET. BUT BEYOND ALL THIS SWEETNESS INACCESSIBLE NEAR AND SO FAR YOUNG MERCILESS AND SERENE THERE IS THIS . . . THIS RIGOUR.

TUESDAY:

NOTHING. EXISTED.

WEDNESDAY:

THERE IS A SUNBEAM ON THE PAPER NAPKIN. IN THE SUNBEAM THERE IS A FLY DRAGGING HIMSELF ALONG STUPEFIED SUNNING HIMSELF AND RUBBING HIS ANTENNÆ ONE AGAINST THE OTHER. I AM GOING TO DO HIM THE FAVOUR OF SQUASHING HIM. HE DOES NOT SEE THIS GIANT FINGER ADVANCING WITH THE GOLD HAIRS SHINING IN THE SUN.

“DON’T KILL IT MONSIEUR!” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SHOUTED.

“I DID IT A FAVOUR.”

WHY AM I HERE?—AND WHY SHOULDN’T I BE HERE? IT IS NOON I AM WAITING FOR IT TO BE TIME TO SLEEP. (FORTUNATELY SLEEP HAS NOT FLED FROM ME.) IN FOUR DAYS I SHALL SEE ANNY AGAIN: FOR THE MOMENT MY SOLE REASON FOR LIVING. AND AFTERWARDS? WHEN ANNY LEAVES ME? I KNOW WHAT I SURREPTITIOUSLY HOPE FOR: I HOPE SHE WILL NEVER LEAVE ME. YET I SHOULD KNOW THAT ANNY WOULD NEVER AGREE TO GROW OLD IN FRONT OF ME. I AM WEAK AND LONELY I NEED HER. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE HER AGAIN IN MY STRENGTH: ANNY IS WITHOUT PITY FOR STRAYED SHEEP.

“ARE YOU WELL MONSIEUR? DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT?”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN LOOKS AT ME OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYES LAUGHING. HE PANTS A LITTLE HIS MOUTH OPEN LIKE A DOG. I ADMIT: THIS MORNING I WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HIM I NEEDED TO TALK.

“HOW GLAD I AM TO HAVE YOU AT MY TABLE” HE SAYS. “IF YOU’RE COLD WE COULD GO AND SIT NEXT TO THE STOVE. THESE GENTLEMEN ARE LEAVING SOON THEY’VE ASKED FOR THE BILL.”

SOMEONE IS TAKING CARE OF ME ASKING IF I AM COLD: I AM SPEAKING TO ANOTHER MAN: THAT HASN’T HAPPENED TO ME FOR YEARS.

“THEY’RE LEAVING DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE PLACES?”

THE TWO MEN HAVE LIGHTED CIGARETTES. THEY LEAVE THERE THEY ARE IN THE PURE AIR IN THE SUNLIGHT. THEY PASS ALONG THE WIDE WINDOWS HOLDING THEIR HATS IN BOTH HANDS. THEY LAUGH; THE WIND BELLIES OUT THEIR OVERCOATS. NO I DON’T WANT TO CHANGE PLACES. WHAT FOR? AND THEN THROUGH THE WINDOWS BETWEEN THE WHITE ROOFS OF THE BATHING-CABINS I SEE THE SEA GREEN COMPACT.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN HAS TAKEN TWO RECTANGLES OF PURPLE CARDBOARD FROM HIS WALLET. HE WILL SOON HAND THEM OVER THE COUNTER. I DECIPHER ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THEM:

MAISON BOTTANET CUISINE BOURGEOISE

LE DÉJEUNER À PRIX FIXE: 8 FRANCS

HORS D’ŒUVRE AU CHOIX

VIANDE GARNIE

FROMAGE OU DESSERT

140 FRANCS LES 20 CACHETS

THE MAN EATING AT THE ROUND TABLE NEAR THE DOOR—I RECOGNIZE HIM NOW: HE OFTEN STOPS AT THE HOTEL PRINTANIA HE’S A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER. FROM TIME TO TIME HE LOOKS AT ME ATTENTIVE AND SMILING; BUT HE DOESN’T SEE ME; HE IS TOO ABSORBED IN HIS FOOD. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTER TWO SQUAT RED-FACED MEN ARE EATING MUSSELS AND DRINKING WHITE WINE. THE SMALLER WHO HAS A THIN YELLOW MOUSTACHE IS TELLING A STORY WHICH MAKES HIM LAUGH. HE PAUSES LAUGHS SHOWING SPARKLING TEETH. THE OTHER DOES NOT LAUGH; HIS EYES ARE HARD. BUT HE OFTEN NODS HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY. NEAR THE WINDOW A SLIGHT DARK-COMPLEXIONED MAN WITH DISTINGUISHED FEATURES AND FINE WHITE HAIR BRUSHED BACK READS HIS PAPER THOUGHTFULLY. A LEATHER DESPATCH CASE IS ON THE BENCH BESIDE HIM. HE DRINKS VICHY WATER. IN A MOMENT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEAVE; WEIGHTED DOWN BY FOOD CARESSED BY THE BREEZE COAT WIDE OPEN FACE A LITTLE FLUSHED THEIR HEADS MUZZY THEY WILL WALK ALONG BY THE BALUSTRADE WATCHING THE CHILDREN ON THE BEACH AND THE SHIPS ON THE SEA; THEY WILL GO TO WORK. I WILL GO NOWHERE I HAVE NO WORK.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN LAUGHS INNOCENTLY AND THE SUN PLAYS THROUGH HIS SPARSE HAIR:

“WOULD YOU LIKE TO ORDER?”

HE HANDS ME THE MENU: I AM ALLOWED ONE HORS D’ŒUVRE: EITHER FIVE SLICES OF SAUSAGE OR RADISHES OR SHRIMPS OR A DISH OF STUFFED CELERY. SNAILS ARE EXTRA.

“I’LL HAVE SAUSAGE” I TELL THE WAITRESS.

HE TEARS THE MENU FROM MY HANDS:

“ISN’T THERE ANYTHING BETTER? HERE ARE BOURGOGNE SNAILS.”

“I DON’T CARE TO MUCH FOR SNAILS.”

“AH! WHAT ABOUT OYSTERS?”

“THEY’RE FOUR FRANCS MORE” THE WAITRESS SAYS.

“ALL RIGHT OYSTERS MADEMOISELLE—AND RADISHES FOR ME.”

BLUSHING HE EXPLAINS TO ME:

“I LIKE RADISHES VERY MUCH.”

SO DO I.

I GLANCE OVER THE LIST OF MEATS. SPICED BEEF TEMPTS ME. BUT I KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT I SHALL HAVE CHICKEN THE ONLY EXTRA MEAT.

“THIS GENTLEMAN WILL HAVE” HE SAYS “THE CHICKEN. SPICED BEEF FOR ME.”

HE TURNS THE CARD. THE WINE LIST IS ON THE BACK:

“WE SHALL HAVE SOME WINE” HE SAYS SOLEMNLY.

“WELL!” THE WAITRESS SAYS “TIMES HAVE CHANGED. YOU NEVER DRANK ANY BEFORE.”

“I CAN STAND A GLASS OF WINE NOW AND THEN. WILL YOU BRING US A CARAFE OF PINK ANJOU?”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN PUTS DOWN THE MENU BREAKS HIS BREAD INTO SMALL BITS AND RUBS HIS KNIFE AND FORK WITH HIS NAPKIN. HE GLANCES AT THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN READING THE PAPER THEN SMILES AT ME:

“I USUALLY COME HERE WITH A BOOK EVEN THOUGH IT’S AGAINST DOCTOR’S ORDERS: ONE EATS TOO QUICKLY AND DOESN’T CHEW. BUT I HAVE A STOMACH LIKE AN OSTRICH I CAN SWALLOW ANYTHING. DURING THE WINTER OF 1917 WHEN I WAS A PRISONER THE FOOD WAS SO BAD THAT EVERYONE GOT ILL. NATURALLY I WENT ON THE SICK LIST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE: BUT NOTHING WAS THE MATTER.”

HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER OF WAR. . . . THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE MENTIONED IT TO ME; I CAN’T GET OVER IT: I CAN’T PICTURE HIM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN.

“WHERE WERE YOU A PRISONER?”

HE DOESN’T ANSWER. HE PUTS DOWN HIS FORK AND LOOKS AT ME WITH PRODIGIOUS INTENSITY. HE IS GOING TO TELL ME HIS TROUBLES: NOW I REMEMBER HE SAID SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN THE LIBRARY. I AM ALL EARS: I AM ONLY TOO GLAD TO FEEL PITY FOR OTHER PEOPLE’S TROUBLES THAT WILL MAKE A CHANGE. I HAVE NO TROUBLES I HAVE MONEY LIKE A CAPITALIST NO BOSS NO WIFE NO CHILDREN; I EXIST THAT’S ALL. AND THAT TROUBLE IS SO VAGUE SO METAPHYSICAL THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DOESN’T SEEM TO WANT TO TALK. WHAT A CURIOUS LOOK HE GIVES ME. IT ISN’T A CASUAL GLANCE BUT HEART SEARCHING. THE SOUL OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS IN HIS EYES HIS MAGNIFICENT BLINDMAN’S EYES WHERE IT BLOOMS. LET MINE DO THE SAME LET IT COME AND STICK ITS NOSE AGAINST THE WINDOWS: THEY COULD EXCHANGE GREETINGS.

I DON’T WANT ANY COMMUNION OF SOULS I HAVEN’T FALLEN SO LOW. I DRAW BACK. BUT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN THROWS HIS CHEST OUT ABOVE THE TABLE HIS EYES NEVER LEAVING MINE. FORTUNATELY THE WAITRESS BRINGS HIM HIS RADISHES. HE DROPS BACK IN HIS CHAIR HIS SOUL LEAVES HIS EYES AND HE DOCILELY BEGINS TO EAT.

“HAVE YOU STRAIGHTENED OUT YOUR TROUBLES?”

HE GIVES A START.

“WHAT TROUBLES MONSIEUR?” HE ASKS NERVOUSLY.

“YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY YOU TOLD ME . . .”

HE BLUSHES VIOLENTLY.

“HA!” HE SAYS IN A DRY VOICE. “HA! YES THE OTHER DAY. WELL IT’S THAT CORSICAN MONSIEUR THAT CORSICAN IN THE LIBRARY.”

HE HESITATES A SECOND TIME WITH THE OBSTINATE LOOK OF A SHEEP.

“IT’S REALLY NOTHING WORTH BOTHERING YOU ABOUT MONSIEUR.”

I DON’T INSIST. WITHOUT SEEMING TO HE EATS WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED. HE HAS ALREADY FINISHED HIS RADISHES WHEN THE GIRL BRINGS ME THE OYSTERS. NOTHING IS LEFT ON HIS PLATE BUT A HEAP OF RADISH STALKS AND A LITTLE DAMP SALT.

OUTSIDE A YOUNG COUPLE HAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE MENU WHICH A COOK IN CARDBOARD HOLDS OUT TO THEM IN HIS LEFT HAND (HE HAS A FRYING PAN IN HIS RIGHT). THEY HESITATE. THE WOMAN IS COLD SHE TUCKS HER CHIN INTO HER FUR COLLAR. THE MAN MAKES UP HIS MIND FIRST HE OPENS THE DOOR AND STEPS INSIDE TO LET THE WOMAN PASS.

SHE ENTERS. SHE LOOKS AROUND HER AMIABLY AND SHIVERS A LITTLE:

“IT’S HOT” SHE SAYS GRAVELY.

THE YOUNG MAN CLOSES THE DOOR.

“MESSIEURS DAMES” HE SAYS.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN TURNS ROUND WITH A PLEASANT: “MESSIEURS DAMES.”

THE OTHER CUSTOMERS DO NOT ANSWER BUT THE DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING GENTLEMAN LOWERS HIS PAPER SLIGHTLY AND SCRUTINIZES THE NEW ARRIVALS WITH A PROFOUND LOOK.

“DON’T BOTHER THANK YOU.”

BEFORE THE WAITRESS WHO HAD RUN UP TO HELP HIM COULD MAKE A MOVE THE YOUNG MAN HAD SLIPPED OUT OF HIS RAINCOAT. IN PLACE OF A MORNING COAT HE WEARS A LEATHER BLOUSE WITH A ZIP. THE WAITRESS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED TURNS TO THE YOUNG WOMAN. BUT ONCE MORE HE IS AHEAD OF HER AND HELPS THE GIRL OUT OF HER COAT WITH GENTLE PRECISE MOVEMENTS. THEY SIT NEAR US ONE AGAINST THE OTHER. THEY DON’T LOOK AS IF THEY’D KNOWN EACH OTHER VERY LONG. THE YOUNG WOMAN HAS A WEARY FACE PURE AND A LITTLE SULLEN. SHE SUDDENLY TAKES OFF HER HAT SHAKES HER BLACK HAIR AND SMILES.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN STUDIES THEM AT GREAT LENGTH WITH A KINDLY EYE; THEN HE TURNS TO ME AND WINKS TENDERLY AS IF TO SAY: “HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE!”

THEY ARE NOT UGLY. THEY ARE QUIET HAPPY AT BEING TOGETHER HAPPY AT BEING SEEN TOGETHER. SOMETIMES WHEN ANNY AND I WENT INTO A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY WE FELT OURSELVES THE OBJECTS OF ADMIRING ATTENTION. IT ANNOYED ANNY BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT PROUD. ABOVE ALL AMAZED; I NEVER HAD THE CLEANCUT LOOK THAT GOES SO WELL WITH THAT YOUNG MAN AND NO ONE COULD EVEN SAY THAT MY UGLINESS WAS TOUCHING. ONLY WE WERE YOUNG: NOW I AM AT THE AGE TO BE TOUCHED BY THE YOUTH OF OTHERS. BUT I AM NOT TOUCHED. THE WOMAN HAS DARK GENTLE EYES; THE YOUNG MAN’S SKIN HAS AN ORANGE HUE A LITTLE LEATHERY AND A CHARMING SMALL OBSTINATE CHIN. THEY ARE TOUCHING BUT THEY ALSO MAKE ME A LITTLE SICK. I FEEL THEM SO FAR FROM ME: THE WARMTH MAKES THEM LANGUID THEY PURSUE THE SAME DREAM IN THEIR HEARTS SO LOW SO FEEBLE. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE THEY LOOK WITH ASSURANCE AT THE YELLOW WALLS THE PEOPLE AND THEY FIND THE WORLD PLEASANT AS IT IS JUST AS IT IS AND EACH ONE OF THEM TEMPORARILY DRAWS LIFE FROM THE LIFE OF THE OTHER. SOON THE TWO OF THEM WILL MAKE A SINGLE LIFE A SLOW TEPID LIFE WHICH WILL HAVE NO SENSE AT ALL—BUT THEY WON’T NOTICE IT.

THEY LOOK AS THOUGH THEY FRIGHTEN EACH OTHER. FINALLY THE YOUNG MAN AWKWARD AND RESOLUTE TAKES THE GIRL’S HAND WITH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS. SHE BREATHES HEAVILY AND TOGETHER THEY LEAN OVER THE MENU. YES THEY’RE HAPPY. SO WHAT.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN PUTS ON AN AMUSED MYSTERIOUS AIR:

“I SAW YOU THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY.”

“WHERE?”

“HA HA!” HE SAYS RESPECTFULLY TEASING.

HE MAKES ME WAIT FOR A SECOND THEN:

“YOU WERE COMING OUT OF THE MUSEUM.”

“OH YES” I SAY “NOT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY: SATURDAY.”

THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I CERTAINLY HAD NO HEART FOR RUNNING AROUND MUSEUMS.

“HAVE YOU SEEN THAT FAMOUS REPRODUCTION IN CARVED WOOD—ORSINI’S ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION?”

“I DON’T RECALL IT.”

“IS IT POSSIBLE? IT’S IN A LITTLE ROOM ON THE RIGHT AS YOU GO IN. IT’S THE WORK OF AN INSURGENT OF THE COMMUNE WHO LIVED IN BOUVILLE UNTIL THE AMNESTY HIDING IN AN ATTIC. HE WANTED TO GO TO AMERICA BUT THE HARBOUR POLICE THERE WERE TOO QUICK FOR HIM. AN ADMIRABLE MAN. HE SPENT HIS SPARE TIME CARVING A GREAT OAK PANEL. THE ONLY TOOLS HE HAD WERE A PENKNIFE AND A NAIL FILE. HE DID THE DELICATE PARTS WITH THE FILE: THE HANDS AND EYES. THE PANEL IS FIVE FEET LONG BY THREE FEET WIDE; THERE ARE SEVENTY FIGURES EACH ONE NO LARGER THAN A HAND WITHOUT COUNTING THE TWO HORSES PULLING THE EMPEROR’S CARRIAGE. AND THE FACES MONSIEUR THE FACES MADE BY THE FILE THEY HAVE A DISTINCT PHYSIOGNOMY A HUMAN LOOK. MONSIEUR IF I MAY ALLOW MYSELF TO SAY SO IT IS A WORK WORTH SEEING.”

I DON’T WANT TO BE INVOLVED:

“I HAD SIMPLY WANTED TO SEE BORDURIN’S PAINTINGS AGAIN.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SUDDENLY GROWS SAD:

“THOSE PORTRAITS IN THE MAIN HALL MONSIEUR?” HE ASKS WITH A TREMBLING SMILE “I UNDERSTAND NOTHING ABOUT PAINTING. OF COURSE I REALIZE THAT BORDURIN IS A GREAT PAINTER I CAN SEE HE HAS A CERTAIN TOUCH A CERTAIN KNACK AS THEY SAY. BUT PLEASURE MONSIEUR AESTHETIC PLEASURE IS FOREIGN TO ME.”

I TELL HIM SYMPATHETICALLY:

“I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT SCULPTURE.”

“AH MONSIEUR I TOO ALAS! AND ABOUT MUSIC AND ABOUT DANCING. YET I AM NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE. WELL IT IS INCONCEIVABLE: I HAVE SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON’T KNOW HALF WHAT I KNOW WHO STANDING IN FRONT OF A PAINTING SEEM TO TAKE PLEASURE IN IT.”

“THEY MUST BE PRETENDING” I SAID TO ENCOURAGE HIM.

“PERHAPS. . . .”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DREAMS FOR A MOMENT:

“WHAT I REGRET IS NOT SO MUCH BEING DEPRIVED OF A CERTAIN TASTE BUT RATHER THAT A WHOLE BRANCH OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IS FOREIGN TO ME. . . . YET I AM A MAN AND MEN HAVE PAINTED THOSE PICTURES. . . .”

SUDDENLY HIS TONE CHANGES:

“MONSIEUR AT ONE TIME I VENTURED TO THINK THAT THE BEAUTIFUL WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TASTE. ARE THERE NOT DIFFERENT RULES FOR EACH EPOCH? ALLOW ME MONSIEUR. . . .”

WITH SURPRISE I SEE HIM DRAW A BLACK LEATHER NOTEBOOK FROM HIS POCKET. HE GOES THROUGH IT FOR AN INSTANT: A LOT OF BLANK PAGES AND FURTHER ON A FEW LINES WRITTEN IN RED INK. HE HAS TURNED PALE. HE HAS SET THE NOTEBOOK FLAT ON THE TABLECLOTH AND SPREAD HIS HUGE HAND ON THE OPEN PAGE. HE COUGHS WITH EMBARRASSMENT:

“SOMETIMES THINGS COME TO MY MIND—I DARE NOT CALL THEM THOUGHTS. IT IS VERY CURIOUS I AM THERE I’M READING WHEN SUDDENLY I DON’T KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM I FEEL ILLUMINATED. FIRST I PAID NO ATTENTION AND THEN I RESOLVED TO BUY A NOTEBOOK.”

HE STOPS AND LOOKS AT ME: HE IS WAITING.

“AH” I SAY.

“MONSIEUR THESE MAXIMS ARE NATURALLY UNPOLISHED: MY INSTRUCTION IS NOT YET COMPLETED.”

HE PICKS UP THE NOTEBOOK WITH TREMBLING HANDS HE IS DEEPLY MOVED:

“AND THERE JUST HAPPENS TO BE SOMETHING HERE ABOUT PAINTING. I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO READ . . .”

“WITH PLEASURE” I SAY.

HE READS:

“NO LONGER DO PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HELD TO BE TRUE. WHY SHOULD WE STILL TAKE PLEASURE IN WORKS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEM BEAUTIFUL?”

HE LOOKS AT ME PLEADINGLY.

“WHAT MUST ONE THINK MONSIEUR? PERHAPS IT IS A PARADOX? I THOUGHT TO ENDOW MY IDEA WITH THE QUALITY OF A CAPRICE.”

“WELL I . . . I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING.”

“HAVE YOU READ IT ANYWHERE BEFORE?”

“NO OF COURSE NOT.”

“REALLY NOWHERE? THEN MONSIEUR” HE SAYS HIS FACE GROWING SAD “IT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRUE. IF IT WERE TRUE SOMEONE WOULD ALREADY HAVE THOUGHT OF IT.”

“WAIT A MINUTE” I TELL HIM “NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT I BELIEVE I HAVE READ SOMETHING LIKE THAT.”

HIS EYES ARE SHINING; HE TAKES OUT HIS PENCIL.

“WHICH AUTHOR?” HE ASKS ME HIS VOICE PRECISE.

“OH . . . RENAN.”

HE IS IN PARADISE.

“WOULD YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO QUOTE THE EXACT PASSAGE FOR ME?” HE ASKS SUCKING THE POINT OF HIS PENCIL.

“OH AS A MATTER OF FACT I READ THAT QUITE A WHILE AGO.”

“OH IT DOESN’T MATTER IT DOESN’T MATTER.”

HE WRITES RENAN IN HIS NOTEBOOK JUST BELOW HIS MAXIM.

“I HAVE COME UPON RENAN! I WROTE THE NAME IN PENCIL” HE EXPLAINS DELIGHTED “BUT THIS EVENING I’LL GO OVER IT IN RED INK.”

HE LOOKS ECSTATICALLY AT HIS NOTEBOOK FOR A MOMENT AND I EXPECT HIM TO READ ME OTHER MAXIMS. BUT HE CLOSES IT CAUTIOUSLY AND STUFFS IT BACK IN HIS POCKET. HE UNDOUBTEDLY HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS ENOUGH HAPPINESS FOR ONE TIME.

“HOW PLEASANT IT IS” HE SAYS INTIMATELY “TO BE ABLE TO TALK SOMETIMES AS NOW WITH ABANDON.”

THIS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED PUTS AN END TO OUR LANGUISHING CONVERSATION. A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWS.

THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE RESTAURANT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG COUPLE. THE TWO RED-FACED MEN ARE SILENT; THEY ARE NONCHALANTLY DETAILING THE YOUNG LADY’S CHARMS. THE DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING GENTLEMAN HAS PUT DOWN HIS PAPER AND IS WATCHING THE COUPLE WITH KINDNESS ALMOST COMPLICITY. HE THINKS THAT OLD AGE IS WISE AND YOUTH IS BEAUTIFUL HE NODS HIS HEAD WITH A CERTAIN COQUETRY: HE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT HE IS STILL HANDSOME WELL PRESERVED THAT WITH HIS DARK COMPLEXION AND HIS SLENDER FIGURE HE IS STILL ATTRACTIVE. HE PLAYS AT FEELING PATERNAL. THE WAITRESS’ FEELINGS APPEAR SIMPLER: SHE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE STARING AT THEM OPEN-MOUTHED.

THEY ARE SPEAKING QUIETLY. THEY HAVE BEEN SERVED THEIR HORS D’OEUVRES BUT THEY DON’T TOUCH THEM. LISTENING CAREFULLY I CAN MAKE OUT SNATCHES OF THEIR CONVERSATION. I UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THE WOMAN SAYS HER VOICE IS RICH AND VEILED.

“NO JEAN NO.”

“WHY NOT?” THE YOUNG MAN MURMURS WITH PASSIONATE VIVACITY.

“I TOLD YOU WHY.”

“THAT’S NOT A REASON.”

A FEW WORDS ESCAPE ME THEN THE YOUNG WOMAN MAKES A CHARMING LAX GESTURE:

“I’VE TRIED TOO OFTEN. I’M PAST THE AGE WHEN YOU CAN START YOUR LIFE AGAIN. I’M OLD YOU KNOW.”

THE YOUNG MAN LAUGHS IRONICALLY. SHE GOES ON:

“I COULDN’T STAND BEING DECEIVED.”

“YOU MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LIFE” THE YOUNG MAN SAYS; “THE WAY YOU ARE THIS MOMENT ISN’T LIVING.”

SHE SIGHS:

“I KNOW!”

“LOOK AT JEANNETTE.”

“YES” SHE SAYS MAKING A LITTLE GRIMACE.

“WELL I THINK WHAT SHE DID WAS SPLENDID. SHE HAD COURAGE.”

“YOU KNOW” THE YOUNG WOMAN SAYS “SHE RATHER JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU MUST KNOW THAT IF I’D WANTED I COULD HAVE HAD A HUNDRED OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT. I PREFERRED TO WAIT.”

“YOU WERE RIGHT” HE SAYS TENDERLY “YOU WERE RIGHT IN WAITING FOR ME.”

SHE LAUGHS IN TURN:

“GREAT STUPID! I DIDN’T SAY THAT.”

I DON’T LISTEN TO THEM ANY MORE: THEY ANNOY ME. THEY’RE GOING TO SLEEP TOGETHER. THEY KNOW IT. EACH ONE KNOWS THAT THE OTHER KNOWS IT. BUT SINCE THEY ARE YOUNG CHASTE AND DECENT SINCE EACH ONE WANTS TO KEEP HIS SELF-RESPECT AND THAT OF THE OTHER SINCE LOVE IS A GREAT POETIC THING WHICH YOU MUST NOT FRIGHTEN AWAY SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK THEY GO TO DANCES AND RESTAURANTS OFFERING THE SPECTACLE OF THEIR RITUAL MECHANICAL DANCES. . . .

AFTER ALL YOU HAVE TO KILL TIME. THEY ARE YOUNG AND WELL BUILT THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO LAST THEM ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS. SO THEY’RE IN NO HURRY THEY DELAY AND THEY ARE NOT WRONG. ONCE THEY HAVE SLEPT TOGETHER THEY WILL HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO VEIL THE ENORMOUS ABSURDITY OF THEIR EXISTENCE. STILL . . . IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO LIE?

I GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM. WHAT A COMEDY! ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING THERE LOOKING SERIOUS EATING. NO THEY AREN’T EATING: THEY ARE RECUPERATING IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY FINISH THEIR TASKS. EACH ONE OF THEM HAS HIS LITTLE PERSONAL DIFFICULTY WHICH KEEPS HIM FROM NOTICING THAT HE EXISTS; THERE ISN’T ONE OF THEM WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE HIMSELF INDISPENSABLE TO SOMETHING OR SOMEONE. DIDN’T THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN TELL ME THE OTHER DAY: “NO ONE BETTER QUALIFIED THAN NOUÇAPIÉ TO UNDERTAKE THIS VAST SYNTHESIS?” EACH ONE OF THEM DOES ONE SMALL THING AND NO ONE IS BETTER QUALIFIED THAN HE TO DO IT. NO ONE IS BETTER QUALIFIED THAN THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER OVER THERE TO SELL SWAN TOOTHPASTE. NO ONE IS BETTER QUALIFIED THAN THAT INTERESTING YOUNG MAN TO PUT HIS HAND UNDER HIS GIRL FRIEND’S SKIRTS. AND I AM AMONG THEM AND IF THEY LOOK AT ME THEY MUST THINK THAT NO ONE IS BETTER QUALIFIED THAN I TO DO WHAT I’M DOING. BUT I KNOW I DON’T LOOK LIKE MUCH BUT I KNOW I EXIST AND THAT THEY EXIST. AND IF I KNEW HOW TO CONVINCE PEOPLE I’D GO AND SIT DOWN NEXT TO THAT HANDSOME WHITE-HAIRED GENTLEMAN AND EXPLAIN TO HIM JUST WHAT EXISTENCE MEANS. I BURST OUT LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FACE HE WOULD MAKE. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN LOOKS AT ME WITH SURPRISE. I’D LIKE TO STOP BUT I CAN’T; I LAUGH UNTIL I CRY.

“YOU ARE GAY MONSIEUR” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAYS TO ME CIRCUMSPECTLY.

“I WAS JUST THINKING” I TELL HIM LAUGHING “THAT HERE WE SIT ALL OF US EATING AND DRINKING TO PRESERVE OUR PRECIOUS EXISTENCE AND REALLY THERE IS NOTHING NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR EXISTING.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN BECOMES SERIOUS HE MAKES AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND ME. I LAUGHED TOO LOUD: I SAW SEVERAL FACES TURN TOWARDS ME. THEN I REGRETTED HAVING SAID SO MUCH. AFTER ALL THAT’S NOBODY’S BUSINESS.

HE REPEATS SLOWLY:

“NO REASON FOR EXISTING . . . YOU UNDOUBTEDLY MEAN MONSIEUR THAT LIFE IS WITHOUT A GOAL? ISN’T THAT WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL PESSIMISM?”

HE THINKS FOR AN INSTANT THEN SAYS GENTLY:

“A FEW YEARS AGO I READ A BOOK BY AN AMERICAN AUTHOR. IT WAS CALLED IS LIFE WORTH LIVING? ISN’T THAT THE QUESTION YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELF?”

CERTAINLY NOT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION I AM ASKING MYSELF. BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE TO EXPLAIN.

“HIS CONCLUSION” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAYS CONSOLINGLY “IS IN FAVOUR OF VOLUNTARY OPTIMISM. LIFE HAS A MEANING IF WE CHOOSE TO GIVE IT ONE. ONE MUST FIRST ACT THROW ONE’S SELF INTO SOME ENTERPRISE. THEN IF ONE REFLECTS THE DIE IS ALREADY CAST ONE IS PLEDGED. I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT MONSIEUR?”

“NOTHING” I SAY.

RATHER I THINK THAT THAT IS PRECISELY THE SORT OF LIE THAT THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE MAN WITH WHITE HAIR TELL THEMSELVES.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SMILES WITH A LITTLE MALICE AND MUCH SOLEMNITY.

“NEITHER IS IT MY OPINION. I DO NOT THINK WE NEED LOOK SO FAR TO KNOW THE DIRECTION OUR LIFE SHOULD TAKE.”

“AH?”

“THERE IS A GOAL MONSIEUR THERE IS A GOAL . . . THERE IS HUMANITY.”

THAT’S RIGHT: I FORGOT HE WAS A HUMANIST. HE REMAINS SILENT FOR A MOMENT LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE MOST OF HIS SPICED BEEF AND A WHOLE SLICE OF BREAD DISAPPEAR CLEANLY AND INEXORABLY. “THERE ARE PEOPLE . . .” HE HAS JUST PAINTED A WHOLE PICTURE OF HIMSELF THIS PHILANTHROPIST. YES BUT HE DOESN’T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. HIS SOUL IS IN HIS EYES UNQUESTIONABLY BUT SOUL IS NOT ENOUGH. BEFORE WHEN I USED TO HANG AROUND SOME PARISIAN HUMANISTS I WOULD HEAR THEM SAY A HUNDRED TIMES: “THERE ARE PEOPLE” AND IT WAS QUITE ANOTHER THING. VIRGAN WAS WITHOUT EQUAL. HE WOULD TAKE OFF HIS SPECTACLES AS IF TO SHOW HIMSELF NAKED IN HIS MAN’S FLESH AND STARE AT ME WITH ELOQUENT EYES WITH A WEARY INSISTENT LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO UNDRESS ME AND DRAG OUT MY HUMAN ESSENCE THEN HE WOULD MURMUR MELODIOUSLY: “THERE ARE PEOPLE OLD MAN THERE ARE PEOPLE” GIVING THE “THERE ARE” A SORT OF AWKWARD POWER AS IF HIS LOVE OF PEOPLE PERPETUALLY NEW AND ASTONISHED WAS CAUGHT UP IN ITS GIANT WINGS.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S MIMICRY HAD NOT ACQUIRED THIS SMOOTHNESS; HIS LOVE FOR PEOPLE IS NAÏVE AND BARBARIC: A PROVINCIAL HUMANIST.

“PEOPLE” I TOLD HIM “PEOPLE . . . IN ANY CASE YOU DON’T SEEM TO WORRY ABOUT THEM VERY MUCH: YOU’RE ALWAYS ALONE ALWAYS WITH YOUR NOSE IN A BOOK.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND BEGAN TO LAUGH MALICIOUSLY:

“YOU’RE WRONG. AH MONSIEUR ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU SO: WHAT AN ERROR!”

HE PULLS HIMSELF TOGETHER FOR AN INSTANT AND FINISHES A DISCREET GULP. HIS FACE IS RADIANT AS DAWN. BEHIND HIM THE YOUNG WOMAN BREAKS OUT IN A LIGHT LAUGH. HER FRIEND BENDS OVER HER WHISPERING IN HER EAR.

“YOUR ERROR IS ONLY TOO NATURAL” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAYS “I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU A LONG TIME AGO. . . . BUT I AM SO TIMID MONSIEUR: I WAS WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.”

“HERE IT IS” I TOLD HIM POLITELY.

“I THINK SO TOO. I THINK SO TOO! MONSIEUR WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU . . .” HE STOPS BLUSHING: “BUT PERHAPS I AM IMPOSING ON YOU?”

I ASSURE HIM THAT HE ISN’T. HE BREATHES A SIGH OF HAPPINESS.

“ONE DOES NOT FIND MEN LIKE YOU EVERY DAY MONSIEUR MEN WHOSE BREADTH OF VISION IS JOINED TO SO MUCH PENETRATION. I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR MONTHS EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I HAVE BEEN WHAT I HAVE BECOME. . . .”

HIS PLATE IS AS EMPTY AND CLEAN AS IF IT HAD JUST BEEN BROUGHT TO HIM. I SUDDENLY DISCOVER NEXT TO MY PLATE A SMALL TIN DISH WHERE A DRUM-STICK SWIMS IN A BROWN GRAVY. IT HAS TO BE EATEN.

“A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SPOKE OF MY CAPTIVITY IN GERMANY. IT ALL STARTED THERE. BEFORE THE WAR I WAS LONELY AND DIDN’T REALIZE IT; I LIVED WITH MY PARENTS GOOD PEOPLE BUT I DIDN’T GET ON WITH THEM. WHEN I THINK OF THOSE YEARS . . . HOW COULD I HAVE LIVED THAT WAY? I WAS DEAD MONSIEUR AND I DIDN’T KNOW IT; I HAD A COLLECTION OF POSTAGE STAMPS.”

HE LOOKS AT ME AND INTERRUPTS HIMSELF:

“MONSIEUR YOU ARE PALE YOU LOOK FATIGUED. I HOPE I’M NOT DISTURBING YOU?”

“YOU INTEREST ME GREATLY.”

“THEN THE WAR CAME AND I ENLISTED WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. I SPENT TWO YEARS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE LIFE AT THE FRONT LEFT LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHTS AND BESIDES THE SOLDIERS WERE TOO COMMON. I WAS TAKEN PRISONER AT THE END OF 1917. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MANY SOLDIERS RECOVERED THEIR CHILDHOOD FAITH WHILE THEY WERE PRISONERS. MONSIEUR” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAYS LOWERING HIS EYELIDS OVER BLOODSHOT EYES “I DO NOT BELIEVE IN GOD; HIS EXISTENCE IS BELIED BY SCIENCE. BUT IN THE INTERNMENT CAMP I LEARNED TO BELIEVE IN MEN.”

“THEY BORE THEIR FATE WITH COURAGE?”

“YES” HE SAYS VAGUELY “THERE WAS THAT TOO. BESIDES WE WERE WELL TREATED. BUT I WANTED TO SPEAK OF SOMETHING ELSE; THE LAST MONTHS OF THE WAR THEY HARDLY GAVE US ANY WORK TO DO. WHEN IT RAINED THEY MADE US GO INTO A BIG WOODEN SHED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF US ALTOGETHER JAMMED IN TIGHTLY. THEY CLOSED THE DOOR AND LEFT US THERE PRESSED ONE AGAINST THE OTHER IN ALMOST TOTAL DARKNESS.”

HE HESITATED AN INSTANT.

“I DON’T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT MONSIEUR. ALL THOSE MEN WERE THERE YOU COULD HARDLY SEE THEM BUT YOU COULD FEEL THEM AGAINST YOU YOU COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THEIR BREATHING. . . . ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES THEY LOCKED US IN THE SHED THE CRUSH WAS SO GREAT THAT AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WAS GOING SUFFOCATE THEN SUDDENLY AN OVERWHELMING JOY CAME OVER ME I ALMOST FAINTED: THEN I FELT THAT I LOVED THESE MEN LIKE BROTHERS I WANTED TO EMBRACE ALL OF THEM. EACH TIME I WENT BACK THERE I FELT THE SAME JOY.”

I HAVE TO EAT MY CHICKEN WHICH BY NOW MUST BE COLD. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN HAS BEEN SILENT FOR A LONG TIME AND THE WAITRESS IS WAITING TO CHANGE THE PLATES.

“THAT SHED TOOK ON A SACRED CHARACTER IN MY EYES. SOMETIMES I MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFULNESS OF MY GUARDS I SLIPPED INTO IT ALL ALONE AND THERE IN THE SHADOW THE MEMORY OF THE JOYS I HAD KNOWN FILLED ME WITH A SORT OF ECSTASY. HOURS PASSED AND I DID NOT NOTICE THEM. SOMETIMES I WEPT.”

I MUST BE SICK: THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OF EXPLAINING THIS TERRIBLE RAGE WHICH SUDDENLY OVERWHELMS ME. YES THE RAGE OF A SICK MAN: MY HANDS WERE SHAKING THE BLOOD HAD RUSHED TO MY FACE AND FINALLY MY LIPS BEGAN TO TREMBLE. ALL THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CHICKEN WAS COLD. I WAS COLD TOO AND THAT WAS THE WORST: I MEAN THAT INSIDE ME I WAS COLD FREEZING AND HAD BEEN LIKE THAT FOR THIRTY-SIX HOURS. ANGER PASSED THROUGH ME LIKE A WHIRLWIND MY CONSCIENCE EFFORT TO REACT TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS LOWERED TEMPERATURE CAUSED SOMETHING LIKE A TREMOR TO PASS THROUGH ME. VAIN EFFORT: UNDOUBTEDLY FOR NOTHING. I WOULD HAVE RAINED DOWN BLOWS AND CURSES ON THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN OR THE WAITRESS. BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE SPIRIT OF IT. MY RAGE AND FURY STRUGGLED TO THE SURFACE AND FOR A MOMENT I HAD THE TERRIBLE IMPRESSION OF BEING TURNED INTO A BLOCK OF ICE ENVELOPED IN FIRE A KIND OF “OMELETTE SURPRISE.” THIS MOMENTARY AGITATION VANISHED AND I HEARD THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAY:

“EVERY SUNDAY I USED TO GO TO MASS. MONSIEUR I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BELIEVER. BUT COULDN’T ONE SAY THAT THE REAL MYSTERY OF THE MASS IS THE COMMUNION OF SOULS? A FRENCH CHAPLAIN WHO HAD ONLY ONE ARM CELEBRATED THE MASS. WE HAD A HARMONIUM. WE LISTENED STANDING OUR HEADS BARE AND AS THE SOUNDS OF THE HARMONIUM CARRIED ME AWAY I FELT MYSELF AT ONE WITH ALL THE MEN SURROUNDING ME. AH MONSIEUR HOW I LOVED THOSE MASSES. EVEN NOW IN MEMORY OF THEM I SOMETIMES GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING. WE HAVE A REMARKABLE ORGANIST AT SAINTE-CÉCILE.”

“YOU MUST HAVE OFTEN MISSED THAT LIFE?”

“YES MONSIEUR IN 1919 THE YEAR OF MY LIBERATION I SPENT MANY MISERABLE MONTHS. I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF I WAS WASTING AWAY. WHENEVER I SAW MEN TOGETHER I WOULD INSERT MYSELF INTO THEIR GROUP. IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME” HE ADDED SMILING “TO FOLLOW THE FUNERAL PROCESSION OF A STRANGER. ONE DAY IN DESPAIR I THREW MY STAMP COLLECTION IN THE FIRE. . . . BUT I FOUND MY VOCATION.”

“REALLY?”

“SOMEONE ADVISED ME . . . MONSIEUR I KNOW THAT I CAN COUNT ON YOUR DISCRETION. I AM—PERHAPS THESE ARE NOT YOUR IDEAS BUT YOU ARE SO BROAD-MINDED—I AM A SOCIALIST.”

HE LOWERED HIS EYES AND HIS LONG LASHES TREMBLED:

“I HAVE BEEN A REGISTERED MEMBER OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY S.F.I.O. SINCE THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1921. THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU.”

HE IS RADIANT WITH PRIDE. HE GAZES AT ME HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED MOUTH OPEN LOOKING LIKE A MARTYR.

“THAT’S VERY FINE” I SAY “THAT’S VERY FINE.”

“MONSIEUR I KNEW THAT YOU WOULD COMMEND ME. AND HOW COULD YOU BLAME SOMEONE WHO COMES AND TELLS YOU: I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE IN SUCH AND SUCH A WAY I AM PERFECTLY HAPPY?”

HE SPREADS HIS ARMS AND PRESENTS HIS OPEN PALMS TO ME THE FINGERS POINTING TO THE GROUND AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO RECEIVE THE STIGMATA. HIS EYES ARE GLASSY I SEE A DARK PINK MASS ROLLING IN HIS MOUTH.

“AH” I SAY “AS LONG AS YOU’RE HAPPY. . . .”

“HAPPY?” HIS LOOK IS DISCONCERTING HE HAS RAISED HIS EYELIDS AND STARES HARSHLY AT ME. “YOU WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE MONSIEUR. BEFORE TAKING THIS DECISION I FELT MYSELF IN A SOLITUDE SO FRIGHTFUL THAT I CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. WHAT HELD ME BACK WAS THE IDEA THAT NO ONE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WOULD BE MOVED BY MY DEATH THAT I WOULD BE EVEN MORE ALONE IN DEATH THAN IN LIFE.”

HE STRAIGHTENS HIMSELF HIS CHEEKS SWELL.

“I AM NO LONGER LONELY MONSIEUR. I SHALL NEVER BE SO.”

“AH YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE?” I ASK.

HE SMILES AND I IMMEDIATELY REALIZE MY MISTAKE.

“I MEAN THAT I NO LONGER FEEL ALONE. BUT NATURALLY MONSIEUR IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO BE WITH ANYONE.”

“BUT” I SAY “WHAT ABOUT THE SOCIALIST SECTION. . . .”

“AH! I KNOW EVERYBODY THERE. BUT MOST OF THEM ONLY BY NAME. MONSIEUR” HE SAYS MISCHIEVOUSLY “IS ONE OBLIGED TO CHOOSE HIS FRIENDS SO NARROWLY? ALL MEN ARE MY FRIENDS. WHEN I GO TO THE OFFICE IN THE MORNING IN FRONT OF ME BEHIND ME THERE ARE OTHER MEN GOING TO WORK. I SEE THEM IF I DARED I WOULD SMILE AT THEM I THINK THAT I AM A SOCIALIST THAT ALL OF THEM ARE MY LIFE’S GOAL THE GOAL OF MY EFFORTS AND THAT THEY DON’T KNOW IT YET. IT’S A HOLIDAY FOR ME MONSIEUR.”

HIS EYES QUESTION ME; I NOD APPROVAL BUT I FEEL HE IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT HE WOULD LIKE MORE ENTHUSIASM. WHAT CAN I DO? IS IT MY FAULT IF IN ALL HE TELLS ME I RECOGNIZE THE LACK OF THE GENUINE ARTICLE? IS IT MY FAULT IF AS HE SPEAKS I SEE ALL THE HUMANISTS I HAVE KNOWN RISE UP? I’VE KNOWN SO MANY OF THEM! THE RADICAL HUMANIST IS THE PARTICULAR FRIEND OF OFFICIALS. THE SO-CALLED “LEFT” HUMANIST’S MAIN WORRY IS KEEPING HUMAN VALUES; HE BELONGS TO NO PARTY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO BETRAY THE HUMAN BUT HIS SYMPATHIES GO TOWARDS THE HUMBLE; HE CONSECRATES HIS BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC CULTURE TO THE HUMBLE. HE IS GENERALLY A WIDOWER WITH A FINE EYE ALWAYS CLOUDED WITH TEARS: HE WEEPS AT ANNIVERSARIES. HE ALSO LOVES CATS DOGS AND ALL THE HIGHER MAMMALS. THE COMMUNIST WRITER HAS BEEN LOVING MEN SINCE THE SECOND FIVE-YEAR PLAN; HE PUNISHES BECAUSE HE LOVES. MODEST AS ALL STRONG MEN HE KNOWS HOW TO HIDE HIS FEELINGS BUT HE ALSO KNOWS BY A LOOK AN INFLECTION OF HIS VOICE HOW TO RECOGNIZE BEHIND HIS ROUGH AND READY JUSTICIAL UTTERANCES HIS PASSION FOR HIS BRETHREN. THE CATHOLIC HUMANIST THE LATE-COMER THE BENJAMIN SPEAKS OF MEN WITH A MARVELLOUS AIR. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY TALE SAYS HE IS THE HUMBLE LIFE OF A LONDON DOCKHAND THE GIRL IN THE SHOE FACTORY! HE HAS CHOSEN THE HUMANISM OF THE ANGELS; HE WRITES FOR THEIR EDIFICATION LONG SAD AND BEAUTIFUL NOVELS WHICH FREQUENTLY WIN THE PRIX FEMINA.

THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL RÔLES. BUT THERE ARE OTHERS A SWARM OF OTHERS: THE HUMANIST PHILOSOPHER WHO BENDS OVER HIS BROTHERS LIKE A WISE ELDER BROTHER WHO HAS A SENSE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES; THE HUMANIST WHO LOVES MEN AS THEY ARE THE HUMANIST WHO LOVES MEN AS THEY OUGHT TO BE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SAVE THEM WITH THEIR CONSENT AND THE ONE WHO WILL SAVE THEM IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES THE ONE WHO WANTS TO CREATE NEW MYTHS AND THE ONE WHO IS SATISFIED WITH THE OLD ONES THE ONE WHO LOVES DEATH IN MAN THE ONE WHO LOVES LIFE IN MAN THE HAPPY HUMANIST WHO ALWAYS HAS THE RIGHT WORD TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH THE SOBER HUMANIST WHOM YOU MEET ESPECIALLY AT FUNERALS OR WAKES. THEY ALL HATE EACH OTHER: AS INDIVIDUALS NATURALLY NOT AS MEN. BUT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DOESN’T KNOW IT: HE HAS LOCKED THEM UP INSIDE HIMSELF LIKE CATS IN A BAG AND THEY ARE TEARING EACH OTHER IN PIECES WITHOUT HIS NOTICING IT.

HE IS ALREADY LOOKING AT ME WITH LESS CONFIDENCE.

“DON’T YOU FEEL AS I DO MONSIEUR?”

“GRACIOUS . . .”

UNDER HIS TROUBLED SOMEWHAT SPITEFUL GLANCE I REGRET DISAPPOINTING HIM FOR A SECOND. BUT HE CONTINUES AMIABLY:

“I KNOW: YOU HAVE YOUR RESEARCH YOUR BOOKS YOU SERVE THE SAME CAUSE IN YOUR OWN WAY.”

MY BOOKS MY RESEARCH: THE IMBECILE. HE COULDN’T HAVE MADE A WORSE HOWLER.

“THAT’S NOT WHY I’M WRITING.”

AT THAT INSTANT THE FACE OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS TRANSFORMED: AS IF HE HAD SCENTED THE ENEMY. I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE BEFORE. SOMETHING HAS DIED BETWEEN US.

FEIGNING SURPRISE HE ASKS:

“BUT . . . IF I’M NOT BEING INDISCREET WHY DO YOU WRITE MONSIEUR?”

“I DON’T KNOW: JUST TO WRITE.”

HE SMILES HE THINKS HE HAS PUT ME OUT:

“WOULD YOU WRITE ON A DESERT ISLAND? DOESN’T ONE ALWAYS WRITE TO BE READ?”

HE GAVE THIS SENTENCE HIS USUAL INTERROGATIVE TURN. IN REALITY HE IS AFFIRMING. HIS VENEER OF GENTLENESS AND TIMIDITY HAS PEELED OFF; I DON’T RECOGNIZE HIM ANY MORE. HIS FEATURES ASSUME AN AIR OF HEAVY OBSTINACY; A WALL OF SUFFICIENCY. I STILL HAVEN’T GOT OVER MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I HEAR HIM SAY:

“IF SOMEONE TELLS ME: I WRITE FOR A CERTAIN SOCIAL CLASS FOR A GROUP OF FRIENDS. GOOD LUCK TO THEM. PERHAPS YOU WRITE FOR POSTERITY. . . . BUT MONSIEUR IN SPITE OF YOURSELF YOU WRITE FOR SOMEONE.”

HE WAITS FOR AN ANSWER. WHEN IT DOESN’T COME HE SMILES FEEBLY.

“PERHAPS YOU ARE A MISANTHROPE?”

I KNOW WHAT THIS FALLACIOUS EFFORT AT CONCILIATION HIDES. HE ASKS LITTLE FROM ME: SIMPLY TO ACCEPT A LABEL. BUT IT IS A TRAP: IF I CONSENT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WINS I AM IMMEDIATELY TURNED ROUND RECONSTITUTED OVERTAKEN FOR HUMANISM TAKES POSSESSION AND MELTS ALL HUMAN ATTITUDES INTO ONE. IF YOU OPPOSE HIM HEAD ON YOU PLAY HIS GAME; HE LIVES OFF HIS OPPONENTS. THERE IS A RACE OF BEINGS LIMITED AND HEADSTRONG WHO LOSE TO HIM EVERY TIME: HE DIGESTS ALL THEIR VIOLENCES AND WORST EXCESSES; HE MAKES A WHITE FROTHY LYMPH OF THEM. HE HAS DIGESTED ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM MANICHEISM MYSTICISM PESSIMISM ANARCHY AND EGOTISM: THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN STAGES UNFINISHED THOUGHTS WHICH FIND THEIR JUSTIFICATION ONLY IN HIM. MISANTHROPY ALSO HAS ITS PLACE IN THE CONCERT: IT IS ONLY A DISSONANCE NECESSARY TO THE HARMONY OF THE WHOLE. THE MISANTHROPE IS A MAN: THEREFORE THE HUMANIST MUST BE MISANTHROPIC TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. BUT HE MUST BE A SCIENTIST AS WELL TO HAVE LEARNED HOW TO WATER DOWN HIS HATRED AND HATE MEN ONLY TO LOVE THEM BETTER AFTERWARDS.

I DON’T WANT TO BE INTEGRATED I DON’T WANT MY GOOD RED BLOOD TO GO AND FATTEN THIS LYMPHATIC BEAST: I WILL NOT BE FOOL ENOUGH TO CALL MYSELF “ANTI-HUMANIST.” I AM NOT A HUMANIST THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

“I BELIEVE” I TELL THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN “THAT ONE CANNOT HATE A MAN MORE THAN ONE CAN LOVE HIM.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN LOOKS AT ME PITYINGLY AND ALOOF. HE MURMURS AS THOUGH HE WERE PAYING NO ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS:

“YOU MUST LOVE THEM YOU MUST LOVE THEM. . . .”

“WHOM MUST YOU LOVE? THE PEOPLE HERE?”

“THEY TOO. ALL.”

HE TURNS TOWARDS THE RADIANT YOUNG COUPLE: THAT’S WHAT YOU MUST LOVE. FOR A MOMENT HE CONTEMPLATES THE MAN WITH WHITE HAIR. THEN HIS LOOK RETURNS TO ME: I READ A MUTE QUESTION ON HIS FACE. I SHAKE MY HEAD: “NO.” HE SEEMS TO PITY ME.

“YOU DON’T EITHER” I TELL HIM ANNOYED “YOU DON’T LOVE THEM.”

“REALLY MONSIEUR? WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO DIFFER?”

HE HAS BECOME RESPECTFUL AGAIN RESPECTFUL TO THE TIP OF HIS TOES BUT IN HIS EYES HE HAS THE IRONIC LOOK OF SOMEONE WHO IS AMUSING HIMSELF ENORMOUSLY. HE HATES ME. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG TO HAVE ANY FEELING FOR THIS MANIAC. I QUESTION HIM IN MY TURN.

“SO THOSE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE BEHIND YOU—YOU LOVE THEM?”

HE LOOKS AT THEM AGAIN PONDERS:

“YOU WANT TO MAKE ME SAY” HE BEGINS SUSPICIOUSLY “THAT I LOVE THEM WITHOUT KNOWING THEM. WELL MONSIEUR I CONFESS I DON’T KNOW THEM. . . . UNLESS LOVE IS KNOWING” HE ADDS WITH A FOOLISH LAUGH.

“BUT WHAT DO YOU LOVE?”

“I SEE THEY ARE YOUNG AND I LOVE THE YOUTH IN THEM. AMONG OTHER THINGS MONSIEUR.”

HE INTERRUPTS HIMSELF AND LISTENS:

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY’RE SAYING?”

DO I UNDERSTAND? THE YOUNG MAN EMBOLDENED BY THE SYMPATHY WHICH SURROUNDS HIM TELLS IN A LOUD VOICE ABOUT A FOOTBALL GAME HIS TEAM WON AGAINST A CLUB FROM LE HAVRE LAST YEAR.

“HE’S TELLING A STORY” I SAY TO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN.

“AH! I CAN’T HEAR THEM VERY WELL. BUT I HEAR THE VOICES THE SOFT VOICE THE GRAVE VOICE: THEY ALTERNATE. IT’S . . . IT’S SO SYMPATHETIC.”

“ONLY I ALSO HEAR WHAT THEY’RE SAYING UNFORTUNATELY.”

“WELL?”

“THEY’RE PLAYING A COMEDY.”

“REALLY? THE COMEDY OF YOUTH PERHAPS?” HE ASKS IRONICALLY. “ALLOW ME MONSIEUR TO FIND THAT QUITE PROFITABLE. IS PLAYING IT ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE YOUNG AGAIN?”

I STAY DEAF TO HIS IRONY; I CONTINUE:

“YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM WHAT THEY SAY ESCAPES YOU. . . . WHAT COLOUR IS THE WOMAN’S HAIR?”

HE IS WORRIED:

“WELL I . . .” HE GLANCES QUICKLY AT THE YOUNG COUPLE AND REGAINS HIS ASSURANCE. “BLACK!”

“SO YOU SEE!”

“SEE WHAT?”

“YOU SEE THAT YOU DON’T LOVE THEM. YOU WOULDN’T RECOGNIZE THEM IN THE STREET. THEY’RE ONLY SYMBOLS IN YOUR EYES. YOU ARE NOT AT ALL TOUCHED BY THEM: YOU’RE TOUCHED BY THE YOUTH OF THE MAN THE LOVE OF MAN AND WOMAN THE HUMAN VOICE.”

“WELL? DOESN’T THAT EXIST?”

“CERTAINLY NOT IT DOESN’T EXIST! NEITHER YOUTH NOR MATURITY NOR OLD AGE NOR DEATH. . . .”

THE FACE OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN HARD AND YELLOW AS A QUINCE HAS STIFFENED INTO A REPROACHFUL LOCKJAW. NEVERTHELESS I KEEP ON:

“JUST LIKE THAT OLD MAN DRINKING VICHY WATER THERE BEHIND YOU. I SUPPOSE YOU LOVE THE MATURE MAN IN HIM: MATURE MAN GOING COURAGEOUSLY TOWARDS HIS DECLINE AND WHO TAKES CARE OF HIMSELF BECAUSE HE DOESN’T WANT TO LET HIMSELF GO?”

“EXACTLY” HE SAYS DEFINITELY.

“AND YOU DON’T THINK HE’S A BASTARD?”

HE LAUGHS HE FINDS ME FRIVOLOUS HE GLANCES QUICKLY AT THE HANDSOME FACE FRAMED IN WHITE HAIR:

“BUT MONSIEUR ADMITTING THAT HE SEEMS TO BE WHAT YOU SAY HOW CAN YOU JUDGE A MAN BY HIS FACE? A FACE MONSIEUR TELLS NOTHING WHEN IT IS AT REST.”

BLIND HUMANISTS! THIS FACE IS SO OUTSPOKEN SO FRANK—BUT THEIR TENDER ABSTRACT SOUL WILL NEVER LET ITSELF BE TOUCHED BY THE SENSE OF A FACE.

“HOW CAN YOU” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAYS “STOP A MAN SAY HE IS THIS OR THAT? WHO CAN EMPTY A MAN! WHO CAN KNOW THE RESOURCES OF A MAN?”

EMPTY A MAN! I SALUTE IN PASSING THE CATHOLIC HUMANISM FROM WHICH THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN BORROWED THIS FORMULA WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

“I KNOW” I TELL HIM “I KNOW THAT ALL MEN ARE ADMIRABLE. YOU ARE ADMIRABLE. I AM ADMIRABLE. IN AS FAR AS WE ARE CREATIONS OF GOD NATURALLY.”

HE LOOKS AT ME WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THEN WITH A THIN SMILE:

“YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY JOKING MONSIEUR BUT IT IS TRUE THAT ALL MEN DESERVE OUR ADMIRATION. IT IS DIFFICULT MONSIEUR VERY DIFFICULT TO BE A MAN.”

WITHOUT REALIZING IT HE HAS ABANDONED THE LOVE OF MEN IN CHRIST; HE NODS HIS HEAD AND BY A CURIOUS PHENOMENON OF MIMICRY HE RESEMBLES THIS POOR MAN OF GEHENNA.

“EXCUSE ME” I SAY “BUT I AM NOT QUITE SURE OF BEING A MAN: I NEVER FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU HAD ONLY TO LET YOURSELF ALONE.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN LAUGHS CANDIDLY BUT HIS EYES STAY WICKED:

“YOU ARE TOO MODEST MONSIEUR. IN ORDER TO TOLERATE YOUR CONDITION THE HUMAN CONDITION YOU AS EVERYBODY ELSE NEED MUCH COURAGE. MONSIEUR THE NEXT INSTANT MAY BE THE MOMENT OF YOUR DEATH YOU KNOW IT AND YOU CAN SMILE: ISN’T THAT ADMIRABLE? IN YOUR MOST INSIGNIFICANT ACTIONS” HE ADDS SHARPLY “THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HEROISM.”

“WHAT WILL YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE FOR DESSERT?” THE WAITRESS SAYS.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS QUITE WHITE HIS EYELIDS ARE HALF-SHUT OVER HIS STONY EYES. HE MAKES A FEEBLE MOTION WITH HIS HAND AS IF INVITING ME TO CHOOSE.

“CHEESE” I SAY HEROICALLY.

“AND YOU?”

HE JUMPS.

“EH? OH YES: WELL . . . I DON’T WANT ANYTHING. I’VE FINISHED.”

“LOUISE!”

THE TWO STOUT MEN PAY AND LEAVE. ONE OF THEM LIMPS. THE PATRON SHOWS THEM TO THE DOOR: THEY ARE IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS THEY WERE SERVED A BOTTLE OF WINE IN A BUCKET OF ICE.

I STUDY THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WITH A LITTLE REMORSE: HE HAS BEEN HAPPY ALL THE WEEK IMAGINING THIS LUNCHEON WHERE HE COULD SHARE HIS LOVE OF MEN WITH ANOTHER MAN. HE HAS SO RARELY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. AND NOW I HAVE SPOILED HIS PLEASURE. AT HEART HE IS AS LONELY AS I AM: NO ONE CARES ABOUT HIM. ONLY HE DOESN’T REALIZE HIS SOLITUDE. WELL YES: BUT IT WASN’T UP TO ME TO OPEN HIS EYES. I FEEL VERY ILL AT EASE: I’M FURIOUS BUT NOT AGAINST HIM AGAINST VIRGAN AND THE OTHERS ALL THE ONES WHO HAVE POISONED THIS POOR BRAIN. IF I COULD HAVE THEM HERE IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO THEM. I SHALL SAY NOTHING TO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN I HAVE ONLY SYMPATHY FOR HIM: HE IS SOMEONE LIKE M. ACHILLE SOMEONE ON MY SIDE BUT WHO HAS BEEN BETRAYED BY IGNORANCE AND GOOD WILL!

A BURST OF LAUGHTER FROM THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN PULLS ME OUT OF MY SAD REFLECTIONS.

“YOU WILL EXCUSE ME BUT WHEN I THINK OF THE DEPTH OF MY LOVE FOR PEOPLE OF THE FORCE WHICH IMPELS ME TOWARDS THEM AND WHEN I SEE US HERE REASONING ARGUING . . . IT MAKES ME WANT TO LAUGH.”

I KEEP QUIET I SMILE CONSTRAINEDLY. THE WAITRESS PUTS A PLATE OF CHALKY CAMEMBERT IN FRONT OF ME. I GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM AND A VIOLENT DISGUST FLOODS ME. WHAT AM I DOING HERE? WHY DID I HAVE TO GET MIXED UP IN A DISCUSSION ON HUMANISM? WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE HERE? WHY ARE THEY EATING? IT’S TRUE THEY DON’T KNOW THEY EXIST. I WANT TO LEAVE GO TO SOME PLACE WHERE I WILL BE REALLY IN MY OWN NICHE WHERE I WILL FIT IN. . . . BUT MY PLACE IS NOWHERE; I AM UNWANTED DE TROP.

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN GROWS SOFTER. HE EXPECTED MORE RESISTANCE ON MY PART. HE IS READY TO PASS A SPONGE OVER ALL I HAVE SAID. HE LEANS TOWARDS ME CONFIDENTIALLY:

“YOU LOVE THEM AT HEART MONSIEUR YOU LOVE THEM AS I DO: WE ARE SEPARATED BY WORDS.”

I CAN’T SPEAK ANY MORE I BOW MY HEAD. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S FACE IS CLOSE TO MINE. HE SMILES FOOLISHLY ALL THE WHILE CLOSE TO MY FACE LIKE A NIGHTMARE. WITH DIFFICULTY I CHEW A PIECE OF BREAD WHICH I CAN’T MAKE UP MY MIND TO SWALLOW. PEOPLE. YOU MUST LOVE PEOPLE. MEN ARE ADMIRABLE. I WANT TO VOMIT—AND SUDDENLY THERE IT IS: THE NAUSEA.

A FINE CLIMAX: IT SHAKES ME FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. I SAW IT COMING MORE THAN AN HOUR AGO ONLY I DIDN’T WANT TO ADMIT IT. THIS TASTE OF CHEESE IN MY MOUTH. . . . THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS BABBLING AND HIS VOICE BUZZES GENTLY IN MY EARS. BUT I DON’T KNOW WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT. I NOD MY HEAD MECHANICALLY. MY HAND IS CLUTCHING THE HANDLE OF THE DESSERT KNIFE. I FEEL THIS BLACK WOODEN HANDLE. MY HAND HOLDS IT. MY HAND. PERSONALLY I WOULD RATHER LET THIS KNIFE ALONE: WHAT GOOD IS IT TO BE ALWAYS TOUCHING SOMETHING? OBJECTS ARE NOT MADE TO BE TOUCHED. IT IS BETTER TO SLIP BETWEEN THEM AVOIDING THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SOMETIMES YOU TAKE ONE OF THEM IN YOUR HAND AND YOU HAVE TO DROP IT QUICKLY. THE KNIFE FALLS ON THE PLATE. THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN STARTS AND LOOKS AT ME. I PICK UP THE KNIFE AGAIN I REST THE BLADE AGAINST THE TABLE AND BEND IT.

SO THIS IS NAUSEA: THIS BLINDING EVIDENCE? I HAVE SCRATCHED MY HEAD OVER IT! I’VE WRITTEN ABOUT IT. NOW I KNOW: I EXIST—THE WORLD EXISTS—AND I KNOW THAT THE WORLD EXISTS. THAT’S ALL. IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. IT’S STRANGE THAT EVERYTHING MAKES SO LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO ME: IT FRIGHTENS ME. EVER SINCE THE DAY I WANTED TO PLAY DUCKS AND DRAKES. I WAS GOING TO THROW THAT PEBBLE I LOOKED AT IT AND THEN IT ALL BEGAN: I FELT THAT IT EXISTED THEN AFTER THAT THERE WERE OTHER NAUSEAS; FROM TIME TO TIME OBJECTS START EXISTING IN YOUR HAND. THERE WAS THE NAUSEA OF THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” AND THEN ANOTHER BEFORE THAT THE NIGHT I WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW; THEN ANOTHER IN THE PARK ONE SUNDAY THEN OTHERS. BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN AS STRONG AS TODAY.

“. . . OF ANCIENT ROME MONSIEUR?”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS ASKING ME A QUESTION I THINK. I TURN TOWARDS HIM AND SMILE. WELL? WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH HIM? WHY IS HE SHRINKING BACK INTO HIS CHAIR? DO I FRIGHTEN PEOPLE NOW? I SHALL END UP THAT WAY. BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. THEY AREN’T COMPLETELY WRONG TO BE AFRAID: I FEEL AS THOUGH I COULD DO ANYTHING. FOR EXAMPLE STAB THIS CHEESE KNIFE INTO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S EYE. AFTER THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE WOULD TRAMPLE ME AND KICK MY TEETH OUT. BUT THAT ISN’T WHAT STOPS ME: A TASTE OF BLOOD IN THE MOUTH INSTEAD OF THIS TASTE OF CHEESE MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. ONLY I SHOULD MAKE SOME MOVE INTRODUCE SOME SUPERFLUOUS EVENT: THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S CRY WOULD BE TOO MUCH—AND THE BLOOD FLOWING DOWN THE CHEEK AND ALL THE PEOPLE JUMPING UP. THERE ARE QUITE ENOUGH THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH EXIST ALREADY.

EVERYONE IS WATCHING ME; THE TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF YOUTH HAVE INTERRUPTED THEIR GENTLE CHAT. THE WOMAN’S MOUTH LOOKS LIKE A CHICKEN’S BACKSIDE. AND YET THEY OUGHT TO SEE THAT I AM HARMLESS.

I GET UP EVERYTHING SPINS AROUND ME. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN STARES AT ME WITH HIS GREAT EYES WHICH I SHALL NOT GOUGE OUT.

“LEAVING ALREADY?” HE MURMURS.

“I’M A LITTLE TIRED. IT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU TO INVITE ME. GOOD-BYE.”

AS I AM ABOUT TO LEAVE I NOTICE THAT I HAVE KEPT THE DESSERT KNIFE IN MY LEFT HAND. I THROW IT ON MY PLATE WHICH BEGINS TO CLINK. I CROSS THE ROOM IN THE MIDST OF SILENCE. NO ONE IS EATING: THEY ARE WATCHING ME THEY HAVE LOST THEIR APPETITE. IF I WERE TO GO UP TO THE YOUNG WOMAN AND SAY “BOO!” SHE’D BEGIN SCREAMING THAT’S CERTAIN. IT ISN’T WORTH THE TROUBLE.

STILL BEFORE GOING OUT I TURN BACK AND GIVE THEM A GOOD LOOK AT MY FACE SO THEY CAN ENGRAVE IT IN THEIR MEMORY.

“GOOD-BYE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.”

THEY DON’T ANSWER. I LEAVE. NOW THE COLOUR WILL COME BACK TO THEIR CHEEKS THEY’LL BEGIN TO JABBER.

I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO I STAY PLANTED IN FRONT OF THE CARDBOARD CHEF. I DON’T NEED TO TURN AROUND TO KNOW THEY ARE WATCHING ME THROUGH THE WINDOWS: THEY ARE WATCHING MY BACK WITH SURPRISE AND DISGUST; THEY THOUGHT I WAS LIKE THEM THAT I WAS A MAN AND I DECEIVED THEM. I SUDDENLY LOST THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN AND THEY SAW A CRAB RUNNING BACKWARDS OUT OF THIS HUMAN ROOM. NOW THE UNMASKED INTRUDER HAS FLED: THE SHOW GOES ON. IT ANNOYS ME TO FEEL ON MY BACK THIS STIRRING OF EYES AND FRIGHTENED THOUGHTS. I CROSS THE STREET. THE OTHER PAVEMENT RUNS ALONG THE BEACH AND THE BATH HOUSES.

MANY PEOPLE ARE WALKING ALONG THE SHORE TURNING POETIC SPRINGTIME FACES TOWARDS THE SEA; THEY’RE HAVING A HOLIDAY BECAUSE OF THE SUN. THERE ARE LIGHTLY DRESSED WOMEN WHO HAVE PUT ON LAST SPRING’S OUTFIT; THEY PASS LONG AND WHITE AS KID GLOVES; THERE ARE ALSO BIG BOYS WHO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL OF COMMERCE OLD MEN WITH MEDALS. THEY DON’T KNOW EACH OTHER BUT THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER WITH AN AIR OF CONNIVANCE BECAUSE IT’S SUCH A FINE DAY AND THEY ARE MEN. STRANGERS EMBRACE EACH OTHER WHEN WAR IS DECLARED; THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER EVERY SPRING. A PRIEST ADVANCES SLOWLY READING HIS BREVIARY. NOW AND THEN HE RAISES HIS HEAD AND LOOKS AT THE SEA APPROVINGLY:—THE SEA IS ALSO A BREVIARY IT SPEAKS OF GOD. DELICATE COLOURS DELICATE PERFUMES SOULS OF SPRING. “WHAT A LOVELY DAY THE SEA IS GREEN I LIKE THIS DRY COLD BETTER THAN THE DAMP.” POETS! IF I GRABBED ONE OF THEM BY THE BACK OF THE COAT IF I TOLD HIM: “COME HELP ME” HE’D THINK “WHAT’S THIS CRAB DOING HERE?” AND WOULD RUN OFF LEAVING HIS COAT IN MY HANDS.

I TURN BACK LEAN BOTH HANDS ON THE BALUSTRADE. THE TRUE SEA IS COLD AND BLACK FULL OF ANIMALS; IT CRAWLS UNDER THIS THIN GREEN FILM MADE TO DECEIVE HUMAN BEINGS. THE SYLPHS ALL ROUND ME HAVE LET THEMSELVES BE TAKEN IN: THEY ONLY SEE THE THIN FILM WHICH PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. I SEE BENEATH IT! THE VENEER MELTS THE SHINING VELVETY SCALES THE SCALES OF GOD’S CATCH EXPLODE EVERYWHERE AT MY LOOK THEY SPLIT AND GAPE. HERE IS THE SAINT-ELÉMIR TRAMWAY I TURN ROUND AND THE OBJECTS TURN WITH ME PALE AND GREEN AS OYSTERS.

USELESS IT WAS USELESS TO GET IN SINCE I DON’T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE.

BLUISH OBJECTS PASS THE WINDOWS. IN JERKS ALL STIFF AND BRITTLE; PEOPLE WALLS; A HOUSE OFFERS ME ITS BLACK HEART THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS; AND THE WINDOWS PALE ALL THAT IS BLACK BECOMES BLUE BLUE THIS GREAT YELLOW BRICK HOUSE ADVANCING UNCERTAINLY TREMBLING SUDDENLY STOPPING AND TAKING A NOSE DIVE. A MAN GETS ON AND SITS DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME. THE YELLOW HOUSE STARTS UP AGAIN IT LEAPS AGAINST THE WINDOWS IT IS SO CLOSE THAT YOU CAN ONLY SEE PART OF IT IT IS OBSCURED. THE WINDOWS RATTLE. IT RISES CRUSHING HIGHER THAN YOU CAN SEE WITH HUNDREDS OF WINDOWS OPENED ON BLACK HEARTS; IT SLIDES ALONG THE CAR BRUSHING PAST IT; NIGHT HAS COME BETWEEN THE RATTLING WINDOWS. IT SLIDES INTERMINABLY YELLOW AS MUD AND THE WINDOWS ARE SKY BLUE. SUDDENLY IT IS NO LONGER THERE IT HAS STAYED BEHIND A SHARP GREY ILLUMINATION FILLS THE CAR AND SPREADS EVERYWHERE WITH INEXORABLE JUSTICE: IT IS THE SKY; THROUGH THE WINDOWS YOU CAN STILL SEE LAYER ON LAYER OF SKY BECAUSE WE’RE GOING UP ELIPHAR HILL AND YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY BETWEEN THE TWO SLOPES ON THE RIGHT AS FAR AS THE SEA ON THE LEFT AS FAR AS THE AIRFIELD. NO SMOKING—NOT EVEN A GITANE.

I LEAN MY HAND ON THE SEAT BUT PULL IT BACK HURRIEDLY: IT EXISTS. THIS THING I’M SITTING ON LEANING MY HAND ON IS CALLED A SEAT. THEY MADE IT PURPOSELY FOR PEOPLE TO SIT ON THEY TOOK LEATHER SPRINGS AND CLOTH THEY WENT TO WORK WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING A SEAT AND WHEN THEY FINISHED THAT WAS WHAT THEY HAD MADE. THEY CARRIED IT HERE INTO THIS CAR AND THE CAR IS NOW ROLLING AND JOLTING WITH ITS RATTLING WINDOWS CARRYING THIS RED THING IN ITS BOSOM. I MURMUR: “IT’S A SEAT” A LITTLE LIKE AN EXORCISM. BUT THE WORD STAYS ON MY LIPS: IT REFUSES TO GO AND PUT ITSELF ON THE THING. IT STAYS WHAT IT IS WITH ITS RED PLUSH THOUSANDS OF LITTLE RED PAWS IN THE AIR ALL STILL LITTLE DEAD PAWS. THIS ENORMOUS BELLY TURNED UPWARD BLEEDING INFLATED—BLOATED WITH ALL ITS DEAD PAWS THIS BELLY FLOATING IN THIS CAR IN THIS GREY SKY IS NOT A SEAT. IT COULD JUST AS WELL BE A DEAD DONKEY TOSSED ABOUT IN THE WATER FLOATING WITH THE CURRENT BELLY IN THE AIR IN A GREAT GREY RIVER A RIVER OF FLOODS; AND I COULD BE SITTING ON THE DONKEY’S BELLY MY FEET DANGLING IN THE CLEAR WATER. THINGS ARE DIVORCED FROM THEIR NAMES. THEY ARE THERE GROTESQUE HEADSTRONG GIGANTIC AND IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS TO CALL THEM SEATS OR SAY ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THEM: I AM IN THE MIDST OF THINGS NAMELESS THINGS. ALONE WITHOUT WORDS DEFENCELESS THEY SURROUND ME ARE BENEATH ME BEHIND ME ABOVE ME. THEY DEMAND NOTHING THEY DON’T IMPOSE THEMSELVES: THEY ARE THERE. UNDER THE CUSHION ON THE SEAT THERE IS A THIN LINE OF SHADOW A THIN BLACK LINE RUNNING ALONG THE SEAT MYSTERIOUSLY AND MISCHIEVOUSLY ALMOST A SMILE. I KNOW VERY WELL THAT IT ISN’T A SMILE AND YET IT EXISTS IT RUNS UNDER THE WHITISH WINDOWS UNDER THE JANGLE OF GLASS OBSTINATELY OBSTINATELY BEHIND THE BLUE IMAGES WHICH PASS IN A THRONG LIKE THE INEXACT MEMORY OF A SMILE LIKE A HALF FORGOTTEN WORD OF WHICH YOU CAN ONLY REMEMBER THE FIRST SYLLABLE AND THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TURN YOUR EYES AWAY AND THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THAT MAN HALF-LYING DOWN ON THE SEAT OPPOSITE ME THERE. HIS BLUE-EYED TERRA COTTA FACE. THE WHOLE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BODY HAS SUNK THE RIGHT ARM IS STUCK TO THE BODY THE RIGHT SIDE BARELY LIVES IT LIVES WITH DIFFICULTY WITH AVARICE AS IF IT WERE PARALYSED. BUT ON THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE THERE IS A LITTLE PARASITIC EXISTENCE WHICH PROLIFERATES; A CHANCE: THE ARM BEGINS TO TREMBLE AND THEN IS RAISED UP AND THE HAND AT THE END IS STIFF. THEN THE HAND BEGINS TO TREMBLE TOO AND WHEN IT REACHES THE HEIGHT OF THE SKULL A FINGER STRETCHES OUT AND BEGINS SCRATCHING THE SCALP WITH A NAIL. A SORT OF VOLUPTUOUS GRIMACE COMES TO INHABIT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE MOUTH AND THE LEFT SIDE STAYS DEAD. THE WINDOWS RATTLE THE ARM SHAKES THE NAIL SCRATCHES SCRATCHES THE MOUTH SMILES UNDER THE STARING EYES AND THE MAN TOLERATES HARDLY NOTICING IT THIS TINY EXISTENCE WHICH SWELLS HIS RIGHT SIDE WHICH HAS BORROWED HIS RIGHT ARM AND RIGHT CHEEK TO BRING ITSELF INTO BEING. THE CONDUCTOR BLOCKS MY PATH.

“WAIT UNTIL THE CAR STOPS.”

BUT I PUSH HIM ASIDE AND JUMP OUT OF THE TRAMWAY. I COULDN’T STAND ANY MORE. I COULD NO LONGER STAND THINGS BEING SO CLOSE. I PUSH OPEN A GATE GO IN AIRY CREATURES ARE BOUNDING AND LEAPING AND PERCHING ON THE PEAKS. NOW I RECOGNIZE MYSELF I KNOW WHERE I AM: I’M IN THE PARK. I DROP ONTO A BENCH BETWEEN GREAT BLACK TREE-TRUNKS BETWEEN THE BLACK KNOTTY HANDS REACHING TOWARDS THE SKY. A TREE SCRAPES AT THE EARTH UNDER MY FEET WITH A BLACK NAIL. I WOULD SO LIKE TO LET MYSELF GO FORGET MYSELF SLEEP. BUT I CAN’T I’M SUFFOCATING: EXISTENCE PENETRATES ME EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE EYES THE NOSE THE MOUTH. . . .

AND SUDDENLY SUDDENLY THE VEIL IS TORN AWAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD I HAVE SEEN.

6.00 P.M.

I CAN’T SAY I FEEL RELIEVED OR SATISFIED; JUST THE OPPOSITE I AM CRUSHED. ONLY MY GOAL IS REACHED: I KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW; I HAVE UNDERSTOOD ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE JANUARY. THE NAUSEA HAS NOT LEFT ME AND I DON’T BELIEVE IT WILL LEAVE ME SO SOON; BUT I NO LONGER HAVE TO BEAR IT IT IS NO LONGER AN ILLNESS OR A PASSING FIT: IT IS I.

SO I WAS IN THE PARK JUST NOW. THE ROOTS OF THE CHESTNUT TREE WERE SUNK IN THE GROUND JUST UNDER MY BENCH. I COULDN’T REMEMBER IT WAS A ROOT ANY MORE. THE WORDS HAD VANISHED AND WITH THEM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THINGS THEIR METHODS OF USE AND THE FEEBLE POINTS OF REFERENCE WHICH MEN HAVE TRACED ON THEIR SURFACE. I WAS SITTING STOOPING FORWARD HEAD BOWED ALONE IN FRONT OF THIS BLACK KNOTTY MASS ENTIRELY BEASTLY WHICH FRIGHTENED ME. THEN I HAD THIS VISION.

IT LEFT ME BREATHLESS. NEVER UNTIL THESE LAST FEW DAYS HAD I UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF “EXISTENCE.” I WAS LIKE THE OTHERS LIKE THE ONES WALKING ALONG THE SEASHORE ALL DRESSED IN THEIR SPRING FINERY. I SAID LIKE THEM “THE OCEAN IS GREEN; THAT WHITE SPECK UP THERE IS A SEAGULL” BUT I DIDN’T FEEL THAT IT EXISTED OR THAT THE SEAGULL WAS AN “EXISTING SEAGULL”; USUALLY EXISTENCE HIDES ITSELF. IT IS THERE AROUND US IN US IT IS US YOU CAN’T SAY TWO WORDS WITHOUT MENTIONING IT BUT YOU CAN NEVER TOUCH IT. WHEN I BELIEVED I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT I MUST BELIEVE THAT I WAS THINKING NOTHING MY HEAD WAS EMPTY OR THERE WAS JUST ONE WORD IN MY HEAD THE WORD “TO BE.” OR ELSE I WAS THINKING . . . HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT? I WAS THINKING OF BELONGING I WAS TELLING MYSELF THAT THE SEA BELONGED TO THE CLASS OF GREEN OBJECTS OR THAT THE GREEN WAS A PART OF THE QUALITY OF THE SEA. EVEN WHEN I LOOKED AT THINGS I WAS MILES FROM DREAMING THAT THEY EXISTED: THEY LOOKED LIKE SCENERY TO ME. I PICKED THEM UP IN MY HANDS THEY SERVED ME AS TOOLS I FORESAW THEIR RESISTANCE. BUT THAT ALL HAPPENED ON THE SURFACE. IF ANYONE HAD ASKED ME WHAT EXISTENCE WAS I WOULD HAVE ANSWERED IN GOOD FAITH THAT IT WAS NOTHING SIMPLY AN EMPTY FORM WHICH WAS ADDED TO EXTERNAL THINGS WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING IN THEIR NATURE. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE IT WAS CLEAR AS DAY: EXISTENCE HAD SUDDENLY UNVEILED ITSELF. IT HAD LOST THE HARMLESS LOOK OF AN ABSTRACT CATEGORY: IT WAS THE VERY PASTE OF THINGS THIS ROOT WAS KNEADED INTO EXISTENCE. OR RATHER THE ROOT THE PARK GATES THE BENCH THE SPARSE GRASS ALL THAT HAD VANISHED: THE DIVERSITY OF THINGS THEIR INDIVIDUALITY WERE ONLY AN APPEARANCE A VENEER. THIS VENEER HAD MELTED LEAVING SOFT MONSTROUS MASSES ALL IN DISORDER—NAKED IN A FRIGHTFUL OBSCENE NAKEDNESS.

I KEPT MYSELF FROM MAKING THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT BUT I DIDN’T NEED TO MOVE IN ORDER TO SEE BEHIND THE TREES THE BLUE COLUMNS AND THE LAMP POSTS OF THE BANDSTAND AND THE VELLEDA IN THE MIDST OF A MOUNTAIN OF LAUREL. ALL THESE OBJECTS . . . HOW CAN I EXPLAIN? THEY INCONVENIENCED ME; I WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM TO EXIST LESS STRONGLY MORE DRYLY IN A MORE ABSTRACT WAY WITH MORE RESERVE. THE CHESTNUT TREE PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST MY EYES. GREEN RUST COVERED IT HALF-WAY UP; THE BARK BLACK AND SWOLLEN LOOKED LIKE BOILED LEATHER. THE SOUND OF THE WATER IN THE MASQUERET FOUNTAIN SOUNDED IN MY EARS MADE A NEST THERE FILLED THEM WITH SIGNS; MY NOSTRILS OVERFLOWED WITH A GREEN PUTRID ODOUR. ALL THINGS GENTLY TENDERLY WERE LETTING THEMSELVES DRIFT INTO EXISTENCE LIKE THOSE RELAXED WOMEN WHO BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAY: “IT’S GOOD TO LAUGH” IN A WET VOICE; THEY WERE PARADING ONE IN FRONT OF THE OTHER EXCHANGING ABJECT SECRETS ABOUT THEIR EXISTENCE. I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO HALF-WAY HOUSE BETWEEN NON-EXISTENCE AND THIS FLAUNTING ABUNDANCE. IF YOU EXISTED YOU HAD TO EXIST ALL THE WAY AS FAR AS MOULDINESS BLOATEDNESS OBSCENITY WERE CONCERNED. IN ANOTHER WORLD CIRCLES BARS OF MUSIC KEEP THEIR PURE AND RIGID LINES. BUT EXISTENCE IS A DEFLECTION. TREES NIGHT-BLUE PILLARS THE HAPPY BUBBLING OF A FOUNTAIN VITAL SMELLS LITTLE HEAT-MISTS FLOATING IN THE COLD AIR A RED-HAIRED MAN DIGESTING ON A BENCH: ALL THIS SOMNOLENCE ALL THESE MEALS DIGESTED TOGETHER HAD ITS COMIC SIDE. . . . COMIC . . . NO: IT DIDN’T GO AS FAR AS THAT NOTHING THAT EXISTS CAN BE COMIC; IT WAS LIKE A FLOATING ANALOGY ALMOST ENTIRELY ELUSIVE WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF VAUDEVILLE. WE WERE A HEAP OF LIVING CREATURES IRRITATED EMBARRASSED AT OURSELVES WE HADN’T THE SLIGHTEST REASON TO BE THERE NONE OF US EACH ONE CONFUSED VAGUELY ALARMED FELT IN THE WAY IN RELATION TO THE OTHERS. IN THE WAY: IT WAS THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP I COULD ESTABLISH BETWEEN THESE TREES THESE GATES THESE STONES. IN VAIN I TRIED TO COUNT THE CHESTNUT TREES TO LOCATE THEM BY THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE VELLEDA TO COMPARE THEIR HEIGHT WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE PLANE TREES: EACH OF THEM ESCAPED THE RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH I TRIED TO ENCLOSE IT ISOLATED ITSELF AND OVERFLOWED. OF THESE RELATIONS (WHICH I INSISTED ON MAINTAINING IN ORDER TO DELAY THE CRUMBLING OF THE HUMAN WORLD MEASURES QUANTITIES AND DIRECTIONS)—I FELT MYSELF TO BE THE ARBITRATOR; THEY NO LONGER HAD THEIR TEETH INTO THINGS. IN THE WAY THE CHESTNUT TREE THERE OPPOSITE ME A LITTLE TO THE LEFT. IN THE WAY THE VELLEDA. . . .

AND I—SOFT WEAK OBSCENE DIGESTING JUGGLING WITH DISMAL THOUGHTS—I TOO WAS IN THE WAY. FORTUNATELY I DIDN’T FEEL IT ALTHOUGH I REALIZED IT BUT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF FEELING IT (EVEN NOW I AM AFRAID—AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT CATCH ME BEHIND MY HEAD AND LIFT ME UP LIKE A WAVE). I DREAMED VAGUELY OF KILLING MYSELF TO WIPE OUT AT LEAST ONE OF THESE SUPERFLUOUS LIVES. BUT EVEN MY DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WAY. IN THE WAY MY CORPSE MY BLOOD ON THESE STONES BETWEEN THESE PLANTS AT THE BACK OF THIS SMILING GARDEN. AND THE DECOMPOSED FLESH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WAY IN THE EARTH WHICH WOULD RECEIVE MY BONES AT LAST CLEANED STRIPPED PEELED PROPER AND CLEAN AS TEETH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WAY: I WAS IN THE WAY FOR ETERNITY.

THE WORD ABSURDITY IS COMING TO LIFE UNDER MY PEN; A LITTLE WHILE AGO IN THE GARDEN I COULDN’T FIND IT BUT NEITHER WAS I LOOKING FOR IT I DIDN’T NEED IT: I THOUGHT WITHOUT WORDS ON THINGS WITH THINGS. ABSURDITY WAS NOT AN IDEA IN MY HEAD OR THE SOUND OF A VOICE ONLY THIS LONG SERPENT DEAD AT MY FEET THIS WOODEN SERPENT. SERPENT OR CLAW OR ROOT OR VULTURE’S TALON WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE. AND WITHOUT FORMULATING ANYTHING CLEARLY I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD FOUND THE KEY TO EXISTENCE THE KEY TO MY NAUSEAS TO MY OWN LIFE. IN FACT ALL THAT I COULD GRASP BEYOND THAT RETURNS TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL ABSURDITY. ABSURDITY: ANOTHER WORD; I STRUGGLE AGAINST WORDS; DOWN THERE I TOUCHED THE THING. BUT I WANTED TO FIX THE ABSOLUTE CHARACTER OF THIS ABSURDITY HERE. A MOVEMENT AN EVENT IN THE TINY COLOURED WORLD OF MEN IS ONLY RELATIVELY ABSURD: BY RELATION TO THE ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES. A MADMAN’S RAVINGS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ABSURD IN RELATION TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH HE FINDS HIMSELF BUT NOT IN RELATION TO HIS DELIRIUM. BUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO I MADE AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE ABSOLUTE OR THE ABSURD. THIS ROOT—THERE WAS NOTHING IN RELATION TO WHICH IT WAS ABSURD. OH HOW CAN I PUT IT IN WORDS? ABSURD: IN RELATION TO THE STONES THE TUFTS OF YELLOW GRASS THE DRY MUD THE TREE THE SKY THE GREEN BENCHES. ABSURD IRREDUCIBLE; NOTHING—NOT EVEN A PROFOUND SECRET UPHEAVAL OF NATURE—COULD EXPLAIN IT. EVIDENTLY I DID NOT KNOW EVERYTHING I HAD NOT SEEN THE SEEDS SPROUT OR THE TREE GROW. BUT FACED WITH THIS GREAT WRINKLED PAW NEITHER IGNORANCE NOR KNOWLEDGE WAS IMPORTANT: THE WORLD OF EXPLANATIONS AND REASONS IS NOT THE WORLD OF EXISTENCE. A CIRCLE IS NOT ABSURD IT IS CLEARLY EXPLAINED BY THE ROTATION OF A STRAIGHT SEGMENT AROUND ONE OF ITS EXTREMITIES. BUT NEITHER DOES A CIRCLE EXIST. THIS ROOT ON THE OTHER HAND EXISTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT. KNOTTY INERT NAMELESS IT FASCINATED ME FILLED MY EYES BROUGHT ME BACK UNCEASINGLY TO ITS OWN EXISTENCE. IN VAIN TO REPEAT: “THIS IS A ROOT”—IT DIDN’T WORK ANY MORE. I SAW CLEARLY THAT YOU COULD NOT PASS FROM ITS FUNCTION AS A ROOT AS A BREATHING PUMP TO THAT TO THIS HARD AND COMPACT SKIN OF A SEA LION TO THIS OILY CALLOUS HEADSTRONG LOOK. THE FUNCTION EXPLAINED NOTHING: IT ALLOWED YOU TO UNDERSTAND GENERALLY THAT IT WAS A ROOT BUT NOT THAT ONE AT ALL. THIS ROOT WITH ITS COLOUR SHAPE ITS CONGEALED MOVEMENT WAS . . . BELOW ALL EXPLANATION. EACH OF ITS QUALITIES ESCAPED IT A LITTLE FLOWED OUT OF IT HALF SOLIDIFIED ALMOST BECAME A THING; EACH ONE WAS IN THE WAY IN THE ROOT AND THE WHOLE STUMP NOW GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF UNWINDING ITSELF A LITTLE DENYING ITS EXISTENCE TO LOSE ITSELF IN A FRENZIED EXCESS. I SCRAPED MY HEEL AGAINST THIS BLACK CLAW: I WANTED TO PEEL OFF SOME OF THE BARK. FOR NO REASON AT ALL OUT OF DEFIANCE TO MAKE THE BARE PINK APPEAR ABSURD ON THE TANNED LEATHER: TO PLAY WITH THE ABSURDITY OF THE WORLD. BUT WHEN I DREW MY HEEL BACK I SAW THAT THE BARK WAS STILL BLACK.

BLACK? I FELT THE WORD DEFLATING EMPTIED OF MEANING WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY. BLACK? THE ROOT WAS NOT BLACK THERE WAS NO BLACK ON THIS PIECE OF WOOD—THERE WAS . . . SOMETHING ELSE: BLACK LIKE THE CIRCLE DID NOT EXIST. I LOOKED AT THE ROOT: WAS IT MORE THAN BLACK OR ALMOST BLACK? BUT I SOON STOPPED QUESTIONING MYSELF BECAUSE I HAD THE FEELING OF KNOWING WHERE I WAS. YES I HAD ALREADY SCRUTINIZED INNUMERABLE OBJECTS WITH DEEP UNEASINESS. I HAD ALREADY TRIED—VAINLY—TO THINK SOMETHING ABOUT THEM: AND I HAD ALREADY FELT THEIR COLD INERT QUALITIES ELUDE ME SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS. ADOLPHE’S SUSPENDERS THE OTHER EVENING IN THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS.” THEY WERE NOT PURPLE. I SAW THE TWO INEXPLICABLE STAINS ON THE SHIRT. AND THE STONE—THE WELL-KNOWN STONE THE ORIGIN OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS: IT WAS NOT . . . I CAN’T REMEMBER EXACTLY JUST WHAT IT WAS THAT THE STONE REFUSED TO BE. BUT I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ITS PASSIVE RESISTANCE. AND THE HAND OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN; I HELD IT AND SHOOK IT ONE DAY IN THE LIBRARY AND THEN I HAD THE FEELING THAT IT WASN’T QUITE A HAND. I HAD THOUGHT OF A GREAT WHITE WORM BUT THAT WASN’T IT EITHER. AND THE SUSPICIOUS TRANSPARENCY OF THE GLASS OF BEER IN THE CAFÉ MABLY. SUSPICIOUS: THAT’S WHAT THEY WERE THE SOUNDS THE SMELLS THE TASTES. WHEN THEY RAN QUICKLY UNDER YOUR NOSE LIKE STARTLED HARES AND YOU DIDN’T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION YOU MIGHT BELIEVE THEM TO BE SIMPLE AND REASSURING YOU MIGHT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS REAL BLUE IN THE WORLD REAL RED A REAL PERFUME OF ALMONDS OR VIOLETS. BUT AS SOON AS YOU HELD ON TO THEM FOR AN INSTANT THIS FEELING OF COMFORT AND SECURITY GAVE WAY TO A DEEP UNEASINESS: COLOURS TASTES AND SMELLS WERE NEVER REAL NEVER THEMSELVES AND NOTHING BUT THEMSELVES. THE SIMPLEST MOST INDEFINABLE QUALITY HAD TOO MUCH CONTENT IN RELATION TO ITSELF IN ITS HEART. THAT BLACK AGAINST MY FOOT IT DIDN’T LOOK LIKE BLACK BUT RATHER THE CONFUSED EFFORT TO IMAGINE BLACK BY SOMEONE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN BLACK AND WHO WOULDN’T KNOW HOW TO STOP WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED AN AMBIGUOUS BEING BEYOND COLOURS. IT LOOKED LIKE A COLOUR BUT ALSO . . . LIKE A BRUISE OR A SECRETION LIKE AN OOZING—AND SOMETHING ELSE AN ODOUR FOR EXAMPLE IT MELTED INTO THE ODOUR OF WET EARTH WARM MOIST WOOD INTO A BLACK ODOUR THAT SPREAD LIKE VARNISH OVER THIS SENSITIVE WOOD IN A FLAVOUR OF CHEWED SWEET FIBRE. I DID NOT SIMPLY SEE THIS BLACK: SIGHT IS AN ABSTRACT INVENTION A SIMPLIFIED IDEA ONE OF MAN’S IDEAS. THAT BLACK AMORPHOUS WEAKLY PRESENCE FAR SURPASSED SIGHT SMELL AND TASTE. BUT THIS RICHNESS WAS LOST IN CONFUSION AND FINALLY WAS NO MORE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH.

THIS MOMENT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I WAS THERE MOTIONLESS AND ICY PLUNGED IN A HORRIBLE ECSTASY. BUT SOMETHING FRESH HAD JUST APPEARED IN THE VERY HEART OF THIS ECSTASY; I UNDERSTOOD THE NAUSEA I POSSESSED IT. TO TELL THE TRUTH I DID NOT FORMULATE MY DISCOVERIES TO MYSELF. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE EASY FOR ME TO PUT THEM IN WORDS NOW. THE ESSENTIAL THING IS CONTINGENCY. I MEAN THAT ONE CANNOT DEFINE EXISTENCE AS NECESSITY. TO EXIST IS SIMPLY TO HE THERE; THOSE WHO EXIST LET THEMSELVES BE ENCOUNTERED BUT YOU CAN NEVER DEDUCE ANYTHING FROM THEM. I BELIEVE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THIS. ONLY THEY TRIED TO OVERCOME THIS CONTINGENCY BY INVENTING A NECESSARY CAUSAL BEING. BUT NO NECESSARY BEING CAN EXPLAIN EXISTENCE: CONTINGENCY IS NOT A DELUSION A PROBABILITY WHICH CAN BE DISSIPATED; IT IS THE ABSOLUTE CONSEQUENTLY THE PERFECT FREE GIFT. ALL IS FREE THIS PARK THIS CITY AND MYSELF. WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT IT TURNS YOUR HEART UPSIDE DOWN AND EVERYTHING BEGINS TO FLOAT AS THE OTHER EVENING AT THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS”: HERE IS NAUSEA; HERE THERE IS WHAT THOSE BASTARDS—THE ONES ON THE COTEAU VERT AND OTHERS—TRY TO HIDE FROM THEMSELVES WITH THEIR IDEA OF THEIR RIGHTS. BUT WHAT A POOR LIE: NO ONE HAS ANY RIGHTS; THEY ARE ENTIRELY FREE LIKE OTHER MEN THEY CANNOT SUCCEED IN NOT FEELING SUPERFLUOUS. AND IN THEMSELVES SECRETLY THEY ARE SUPERFLUOUS THAT IS TO SAY AMORPHOUS VAGUE AND SAD.

HOW LONG WILL THIS FASCINATION LAST? I WAS THE ROOT OF THE CHESTNUT TREE. OR RATHER I WAS ENTIRELY CONSCIOUS OF ITS EXISTENCE. STILL DETACHED FROM IT—SINCE I WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT—YET LOST IN IT NOTHING BUT IT. AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING LET ITSELF FALL WITH ALL ITS WEIGHT ON THIS PIECE OF DEAD WOOD. TIME HAD STOPPED: A SMALL BLACK POOL AT MY FEET; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMETHING TO COME AFTER THAT MOMENT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TEAR MYSELF FROM THAT ATROCIOUS JOY BUT I DID NOT EVEN IMAGINE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE; I WAS INSIDE; THE BLACK STUMP DID NOT MOVE IT STAYED THERE IN MY EYES AS A LUMP OF FOOD STICKS IN THE WINDPIPE. I COULD NEITHER ACCEPT NOR REFUSE IT. AT WHAT A COST DID I RAISE MY EYES? DID I RAISE THEM? RATHER DID I NOT OBLITERATE MYSELF FOR AN INSTANT IN ORDER TO BE REBORN IN THE FOLLOWING INSTANT WITH MY HEAD THROWN BACK AND MY EYES RAISED UPWARD? IN FACT I WAS NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF THE TRANSFORMATION. BUT SUDDENLY IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO THINK OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE ROOT. IT WAS WIPED OUT I COULD REPEAT IN VAIN: IT EXISTS IT IS STILL THERE UNDER THE BENCH AGAINST MY RIGHT FOOT IT NO LONGER MEANT ANYTHING. EXISTENCE IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH LETS ITSELF BE THOUGHT OF FROM A DISTANCE: IT MUST INVADE YOU SUDDENLY MASTER YOU WEIGH HEAVILY ON YOUR HEART LIKE A GREAT MOTIONLESS BEAST—OR ELSE THERE IS NOTHING MORE AT ALL.

THERE WAS NOTHING MORE MY EYES WERE EMPTY AND I WAS SPELLBOUND BY MY DELIVERANCE. THEN SUDDENLY IT BEGAN TO MOVE BEFORE MY EYES IN LIGHT UNCERTAIN MOTIONS: THE WIND WAS SHAKING THE TOP OF THE TREE.

IT DID NOT DISPLEASE ME TO SEE A MOVEMENT IT WAS A CHANGE FROM THESE MOTIONLESS BEINGS WHO WATCHED ME LIKE STARING EYES. I TOLD MYSELF AS I FOLLOWED THE SWINGING OF THE BRANCHES: MOVEMENTS NEVER QUITE EXIST THEY ARE PASSAGES INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN TWO EXISTENCES MOMENTS OF WEAKNESS I EXPECTED TO SEE THEM COME OUT OF NOTHINGNESS PROGRESSIVELY RIPEN BLOSSOM: I WAS FINALLY GOING TO SURPRISE BEINGS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING BORN.

NO MORE THAN THREE SECONDS AND ALL MY HOPES WERE SWEPT AWAY. I COULD NOT ATTRIBUTE THE PASSAGE OF TIME TO THESE BRANCHES GROPING AROUND LIKE BLIND MEN. THIS IDEA OF PASSAGE WAS STILL AN INVENTION OF MAN. THE IDEA WAS TOO TRANSPARENT. ALL THESE PALTRY AGITATIONS DREW IN ON THEMSELVES ISOLATED. THEY OVERFLOWED THE LEAVES AND BRANCHES EVERYWHERE. THEY WHIRLED ABOUT THESE EMPTY HANDS ENVELOPED THEM WITH TINY WHIRLWINDS. OF COURSE A MOVEMENT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM A TREE. BUT IT WAS STILL AN ABSOLUTE. A THING. MY EYES ONLY ENCOUNTERED COMPLETION. THE TIPS OF THE BRANCHES RUSTLED WITH EXISTENCE WHICH UNCEASINGLY RENEWED ITSELF AND WHICH WAS NEVER BORN. THE EXISTING WIND RESTED ON THE TREE LIKE A GREAT BLUEBOTTLE AND THE TREE SHUDDERED. BUT THE SHUDDER WAS NOT A NASCENT QUALITY A PASSING FROM POWER TO ACTION; IT WAS A THING; A SHUDDER-THING FLOWED INTO THE TREE TOOK POSSESSION OF IT SHOOK IT AND SUDDENLY ABANDONED IT GOING FURTHER ON TO SPIN ABOUT ITSELF. ALL WAS FULLNESS AND ALL WAS ACTIVE THERE WAS NO WEAKNESS IN TIME ALL EVEN THE LEAST PERCEPTIBLE STIRRING WAS MADE OF EXISTENCE. AND ALL THESE EXISTENTS WHICH BUSTLED ABOUT THIS TREE CAME FROM NOWHERE AND WERE GOING NOWHERE. SUDDENLY THEY EXISTED THEN SUDDENLY THEY EXISTED NO LONGER: EXISTENCE IS WITHOUT MEMORY; OF THE VANISHED IT RETAINS NOTHING—NOT EVEN A MEMORY. EXISTENCE EVERYWHERE INFINITELY IN EXCESS FOR EVER AND EVERYWHERE; EXISTENCE—WHICH IS LIMITED ONLY BY EXISTENCE. I SANK DOWN ON THE BENCH STUPEFIED STUNNED BY THIS PROFUSION OF BEINGS WITHOUT ORIGIN: EVERYWHERE BLOSSOMINGS HATCHINGS OUT MY EARS BUZZED WITH EXISTENCE MY VERY FLESH THROBBED AND OPENED ABANDONED ITSELF TO THE UNIVERSAL BURGEONING. IT WAS REPUGNANT. BUT WHY I THOUGHT WHY SO MANY EXISTENCES SINCE THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE? WHAT GOOD ARE SO MANY DUPLICATES OF TREES? SO MANY EXISTENCES MISSED OBSTINATELY BEGUN AGAIN AND AGAIN MISSED—LIKE THE AWKWARD EFFORTS OF AN INSECT FALLEN ON ITS BACK? (I WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFORTS.) THAT ABUNDANCE DID NOT GIVE THE EFFECT OF GENEROSITY JUST THE OPPOSITE. IT WAS DISMAL AILING EMBARRASSED AT ITSELF. THOSE TREES THOSE GREAT CLUMSY BODIES. . . . I BEGAN TO LAUGH BECAUSE I SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF THE FORMIDABLE SPRINGS DESCRIBED IN BOOKS FULL OF CRACKINGS BURSTINGS GIGANTIC EXPLOSIONS. THERE WERE THOSE IDIOTS WHO CAME TO TELL YOU ABOUT WILL-POWER AND STRUGGLE FOR LIFE. HADN’T THEY EVER SEEN A BEAST OR A TREE? THIS PLANE-TREE WITH ITS SCALING BARK THIS HALF-ROTTEN OAK THEY WANTED ME TO TAKE THEM FOR RUGGED YOUTHFUL ENDEAVOUR SURGING TOWARDS THE SKY. AND THAT ROOT? I WOULD HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY HAD TO REPRESENT IT AS A VORACIOUS CLAW TEARING AT THE EARTH DEVOURING ITS FOOD?

IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THINGS THAT WAY. WEAKNESSES FRAILTIES YES. THE TREES FLOATED. GUSHING TOWARDS THE SKY? OR RATHER A COLLAPSE; AT ANY INSTANT I EXPECTED TO SEE THE TREE-TRUNKS SHRIVEL LIKE WEARY WANDS CRUMPLE UP FALL ON THE GROUND IN A SOFT FOLDED BLACK HEAP. THEY DID NOT WANT TO EXIST ONLY THEY COULD NOT HELP THEMSELVES. SO THEY QUIETLY MINDED THEIR OWN BUSINESS; THE SAP ROSE UP SLOWLY THROUGH THE STRUCTURE HALF RELUCTANT AND THE ROOTS SANK SLOWLY INTO THE EARTH. BUT AT EACH INSTANT THEY SEEMED ON THE VERGE OF LEAVING EVERYTHING THERE AND OBLITERATING THEMSELVES. TIRED AND OLD THEY KEPT ON EXISTING AGAINST THE GRAIN SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO WEAK TO DIE BECAUSE DEATH COULD ONLY COME TO THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE: STRAINS OF MUSIC ALONE CAN PROUDLY CARRY THEIR OWN DEATH WITHIN THEMSELVES LIKE AN INTERNAL NECESSITY: ONLY THEY DON’T EXIST. EVERY EXISTING THING IS BORN WITHOUT REASON PROLONGS ITSELF OUT OF WEAKNESS AND DIES BY CHANCE. I LEANED BACK AND CLOSED MY EYES. BUT THE IMAGES FOREWARNED IMMEDIATELY LEAPED UP AND FILLED MY CLOSED EYES WITH EXISTENCES: EXISTENCE IS A FULLNESS WHICH MAN CAN NEVER ABANDON.

STRANGE IMAGES. THEY REPRESENTED A MULTITUDE OF THINGS. NOT REAL THINGS OTHER THINGS WHICH LOOKED LIKE THEM. WOODEN OBJECTS WHICH LOOKED LIKE CHAIRS SHOES OTHER OBJECTS WHICH LOOKED LIKE PLANTS. AND THEN TWO FACES: THE COUPLE WHO WERE EATING OPPOSITE TO ME LAST SUNDAY IN THE BRASSERIE VÉZELISE. FAT HOT SENSUAL ABSURD WITH RED EARS. I COULD SEE THE WOMAN’S NECK AND SHOULDERS. NUDE EXISTENCE. THOSE TWO—IT SUDDENLY GAVE ME A TURN—THOSE TWO WERE STILL EXISTING SOMEWHERE IN BOUVILLE; SOMEWHERE—IN THE MIDST OF SMELLS?—THIS SOFT THROAT RUBBING UP LUXURIOUSLY AGAINST SMOOTH STUFFS NESTLING IN LACE; AND THE WOMAN PICTURING HER BOSOM UNDER HER BLOUSE THINKING: “MY TITTIES MY LOVELY FRUITS” SMILING MYSTERIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO THE SWELLING OF HER BREASTS WHICH TICKLED . . . THEN I SHOUTED AND FOUND MYSELF WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN.

HAD I DREAMED OF THIS ENORMOUS PRESENCE? IT WAS THERE IN THE GARDEN TOPPLED DOWN INTO THE TREES ALL SOFT STICKY SOILING EVERYTHING ALL THICK A JELLY. AND I WAS INSIDE I WITH THE GARDEN. I WAS FRIGHTENED FURIOUS I THOUGHT IT WAS SO STUPID SO OUT OF PLACE I HATED THIS IGNOBLE MESS. MOUNTING UP MOUNTING UP AS HIGH AS THE SKY SPILLING OVER FILLING EVERYTHING WITH ITS GELATINOUS SLITHER AND I COULD SEE DEPTHS UPON DEPTHS OF IT REACHING FAR BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE GARDEN THE HOUSES AND BOUVILLE AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH. I WAS NO LONGER IN BOUVILLE I WAS NOWHERE I WAS FLOATING. I WAS NOT SURPRISED I KNEW IT WAS THE WORLD THE NAKED WORLD SUDDENLY REVEALING ITSELF AND I CHOKED WITH RAGE AT THIS GROSS ABSURD BEING. YOU COULDN’T EVEN WONDER WHERE ALL THAT SPRANG FROM OR HOW IT WAS THAT A WORLD CAME INTO EXISTENCE RATHER THAN NOTHINGNESS. IT DIDN’T MAKE SENSE THE WORLD WAS EVERYWHERE IN FRONT BEHIND. THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING BEFORE IT. NOTHING. THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A MOMENT IN WHICH IT COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED. THAT WAS WHAT WORRIED ME: OF COURSE THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS FLOWING LARVA TO EXIST. BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT IS NOT TO EXIST. IT WAS UNTHINKABLE: TO IMAGINE NOTHINGNESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE ALREADY IN THE MIDST OF THE WORLD EYES WIDE OPEN AND ALIVE; NOTHINGNESS WAS ONLY AN IDEA IN MY HEAD AN EXISTING IDEA FLOATING IN THIS IMMENSITY: THIS NOTHINGNESS HAD NOT COME BEFORE EXISTENCE IT WAS AN EXISTENCE LIKE ANY OTHER AND APPEARED AFTER MANY OTHERS. I SHOUTED “FILTH! WHAT ROTTEN FILTH!” AND SHOOK MYSELF TO GET RID OF THIS STICKY FILTH BUT IT HELD FAST AND THERE WAS SO MUCH TONS AND TONS OF EXISTENCE ENDLESS: I STIFLED AT THE DEPTHS OF THIS IMMENSE WEARINESS. AND THEN SUDDENLY THE PARK EMPTIED AS THROUGH A GREAT HOLE THE WORLD DISAPPEARED AS IT HAD COME OR ELSE I WOKE UP—IN ANY CASE I SAW NO MORE OF IT; NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT THE YELLOW EARTH AROUND ME OUT OF WHICH DEAD BRANCHES ROSE UPWARD.

I GOT UP AND WENT OUT. ONCE AT THE GATE I TURNED BACK. THEN THE GARDEN SMILED AT ME. I LEANED AGAINST THE GATE AND WATCHED FOR A LONG TIME. THE SMILE OF THE TREES OF THE LAUREL MEANT SOMETHING; THAT WAS THE REAL SECRET OF EXISTENCE. I REMEMBERED ONE SUNDAY NOT MORE THAN THREE WEEKS AGO I HAD ALREADY DETECTED EVERYWHERE A SORT OF CONSPIRATORIAL AIR. WAS IT IN MY INTENTION? I FELT WITH BOREDOM THAT I HAD NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING. NO WAY. YET IT WAS THERE WAITING LOOKING AT ONE. IT WAS THERE ON THE TRUNK OF THE CHESTNUT TREE . . . IT WAS THE CHESTNUT TREE. THINGS—YOU MIGHT HAVE CALLED THEM THOUGHTS—WHICH STOPPED HALFWAY WHICH WERE FORGOTTEN WHICH FORGOT WHAT THEY WANTED TO THINK AND WHICH STAYED LIKE THAT HANGING ABOUT WITH AN ODD LITTLE SENSE WHICH WAS BEYOND THEM. THAT LITTLE SENSE ANNOYED ME: I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE STAYED LEANING AGAINST THE GATE FOR A CENTURY; I HAD LEARNED ALL I COULD KNOW ABOUT EXISTENCE. I LEFT I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND I WROTE.

NIGHT:

I HAVE MADE MY DECISION: I HAVE NO MORE REASON FOR STAYING IN BOUVILLE SINCE I’M NOT WRITING MY BOOK ANY MORE; I’M GOING TO LIVE IN PARIS. I’LL TAKE THE FIVE O’CLOCK TRAIN ON SATURDAY I’LL SEE ANNY; I THINK WE’LL SPEND A FEW DAYS TOGETHER. THEN I’LL COME BACK HERE TO SETTLE MY ACCOUNTS AND PACK MY TRUNKS. BY MARCH 1 AT THE LATEST I WILL BE DEFINITELY INSTALLED IN PARIS.

FRIDAY:

IN THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS.” MY TRAIN LEAVES IN TWENTY MINUTES. THE GRAMOPHONE. STRONG FEELING OF ADVENTURE.

SATURDAY:

ANNY OPENS TO ME IN A LONG BLACK DRESS. NATURALLY SHE DOES NOT PUT OUT HER HAND SHE DOESN’T SAY HELLO. SULLENLY AND QUICKLY TO GET THE FORMALITIES OVER WITH SHE SAYS:

‘COME IN AND SIT DOWN ANYWHERE—EXCEPT ON THE ARMCHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW.”

IT’S REALLY SHE. SHE LETS HER ARMS HANG SHE HAS THE MOROSE FACE WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD ADOLESCENT GIRL. BUT SHE DOESN’T LOOK LIKE A LITTLE GIRL ANY MORE. SHE IS FAT HER BREASTS ARE HEAVY.

SHE CLOSES THE DOOR AND SAYS MEDITATIVELY TO HERSELF:

“I DON’T KNOW WHETHER I’M GOING TO SIT ON THE BED. . . .”

FINALLY SHE DROPS ON TO A SORT OF CHEST COVERED WITH A CARPET. HER WALK IS NO LONGER THE SAME: SHE MOVES WITH A MAJESTIC HEAVINESS NOT WITHOUT GRACE: SHE SEEMS EMBARRASSED AT HER YOUTHFUL FLESHINESS. BUT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING IT’S REALLY ANNY.

ANNY BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.

“WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?”

AS USUAL SHE DOESN’T ANSWER RIGHT AWAY AND STARTS LOOKING QUARRELSOME.

“TELL ME WHY YOU’RE LAUGHING.”

“BECAUSE OF THAT WIDE SMILE YOU’VE BEEN WEARING EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE. YOU LOOK LIKE A FATHER WHO’S JUST MARRIED OFF HIS DAUGHTER. COME ON DON’T JUST STAND THERE. TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND SIT DOWN. YES OVER THERE IF YOU WANT.”

A SILENCE FOLLOWS. ANNY DOES NOT TRY TO BREAK IT. HOW BARE THIS ROOM IS! BEFORE ANNY ALWAYS USED TO CARRY AN IMMENSE TRUNK FULL OF SHAWLS TURBANS MANTILLAS JAPANESE MASKS PICTURES OF EPINAL. HARDLY ARRIVED AT AN HOTEL—EVEN IF IT IS ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT—THAN HER FIRST JOB IS TO OPEN THIS TRUNK AND TAKE OUT ALL HER WEALTH WHICH SHE HANGS ON THE WALLS ON LAMPS SPREADS OVER TABLES OR ON THE FLOOR FOLLOWING A CHANGEABLE AND COMPLICATED ORDER; IN LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES THE DULLEST ROOM BECAME INVESTED WITH A HEAVY SENSUAL ALMOST INTOLERABLE PERSONALITY. PERHAPS THE TRUNK GOT LOST—OR STAYED IN THE CHECK ROOM. . . . THIS COLD ROOM WITH THE DOOR HALF-OPEN ON THE BATHROOM HAS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT IT. IT LOOKS LIKE—ONLY SADDER AND MORE LUXURIOUS-LIKE MY ROOM IN BOUVILLE.

ANNY LAUGHS AGAIN. HOW WILL I RECOGNIZE THIS HIGH-PITCHED NASAL LITTLE LAUGH?

“WELL YOU HAVEN’T CHANGED. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WITH THAT BEWILDERED LOOK ON YOUR FACE?”

SHE SMILES BUT STUDIES MY FACE WITH ALMOST HOSTILE CURIOSITY.

“I WAS ONLY THINKING THIS ROOM DOESN’T LOOK AS IF YOU WERE LIVING IN IT.”

“REALLY?” SHE ANSWERS VAGUELY.

ANOTHER SILENCE. NOW SHE IS SITTING ON THE BED VERY PALE IN HER BLACK DRESS. SHE HASN’T CUT HER HAIR. SHE IS STILL WATCHING ME CALMLY RAISING HER EYEBROWS A LITTLE. HAS SHE GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO ME? WHY DID SHE MAKE ME COME HERE? THIS SILENCE IS UNBEARABLE.

SUDDENLY I SAY PITIFULLY:

“I’M GLAD TO SEE YOU.”

THE LAST WORD STICKS IN MY THROAT: I WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO KEEP QUIET. SHE IS SURELY GOING TO BE ANGRY. I EXPECTED THE FIRST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO BE DIFFICULT. IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN I SAW ANNY AGAIN WHETHER AFTER A TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR ABSENCE OR ON WAKING IN THE MORNING I COULD NEVER FIND THE WORDS SHE EXPECTED THE WORDS WHICH WENT WITH HER DRESS WITH THE WEATHER WITH THE LAST WORDS WE HAD SPOKEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. WHAT DOES SHE WANT? I CAN’T GUESS.

I RAISE MY EYES AGAIN. ANNY LOOKS AT ME WITH A SORT OF TENDERNESS.

“YOU HAVEN’T CHANGED AT ALL? YOU’RE STILL JUST AS MUCH OF A FOOL?”

HER FACE SHOWS SATISFACTION. BUT HOW TIRED SHE LOOKS!

“YOU’RE A MILESTONE” SHE SAYS “A MILESTONE BESIDE A ROAD. YOU EXPLAIN IMPERTURBABLY AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE YOU’LL GO ON EXPLAINING THAT MELUN IS TWENTY-SEVEN KILOMETRES AND MONTARGIS IS FORTY-TWO. THAT’S WHY I NEED YOU SO MUCH.”

“NEED ME? YOU MEAN YOU NEEDED ME THESE FOUR YEARS I HAVEN’T SEEN YOU? YOU’VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET ABOUT IT.”

I SPOKE LIGHTLY: SHE MIGHT THINK I AM RESENTFUL. I FEEL A FALSE SMILE ON MY MOUTH I’M UNCOMFORTABLE.

“WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE! NATURALLY I DON’T NEED TO SEE YOU IF THAT’S WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU KNOW YOU’RE NOT EXACTLY A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES. I NEED YOU TO EXIST AND NOT TO CHANGE. YOU’RE LIKE THAT PLATINUM WIRE THEY KEEP IN PARIS OR SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. I DON’T THINK ANYONE’S EVER NEEDED TO SEE IT.”

“THAT’S WHERE YOU’RE MISTAKEN.”

“NOT I. ANYHOW IT DOESN’T MATTER. I’M GLAD TO KNOW THAT IT EXISTS THAT IT MEASURES THE EXACT TEN-MILLIONTH PART OF A QUARTER OF A MERIDIAN. I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY TIME THEY START TAKING MEASUREMENTS IN AN APARTMENT OR WHEN PEOPLE SELL ME CLOTH BY THE YARD.”

“IS THAT SO?” I SAY COLDLY.

“BUT YOU KNOW I COULD VERY WELL THINK OF YOU ONLY AS AN ABSTRACT VIRTUE A SORT OF LIMIT. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO ME FOR REMEMBERING YOUR FACE EACH TIME.”

HERE WE ARE BACK TO THESE ALEXANDRINE DISCUSSIONS I HAD TO GO THROUGH BEFORE WHEN IN MY HEART I HAD THE SIMPLEST COMMONEST DESIRES SUCH AS TELLING HER I LOVED HER TAKING HER IN MY ARMS. TODAY I HAVE NO SUCH DESIRE. EXCEPT PERHAPS A DESIRE TO BE QUIET AND TO LOOK AT HER TO REALIZE IN SILENCE ALL THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY EVENT: THE PRESENCE OF ANNY OPPOSITE ME. IS THIS DAY LIKE ANY OTHER DAY FOR HER? HER HANDS ARE NOT TREMBLING. SHE MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO TELL ME THE DAY SHE WROTE—OR PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY A WHIM. NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO QUESTION OF IT FOR A LONG TIME.

ANNY SUDDENLY SMILES AT ME WITH A TENDERNESS SO APPARENT THAT TEARS COME TO MY EYES.

“I’VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN THAT YARD OF PLATINUM. THERE HASN’T BEEN A DAY WHEN I HAVEN’T THOUGHT OF YOU. AND I REMEMBERED EXACTLY WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE—EVERY DETAIL.”

SHE GETS UP COMES AND RESTS HER ARMS ON MY SHOULDERS.

“YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT ME BUT YOU DAREN’T PRETEND YOU REMEMEBERED MY FACE.”

“THAT’S NOT FAIR” I SAY “YOU KNOW I HAVE A BAD MEMORY.”

“YOU ADMIT IT: YOU’D FORGOTTEN ME COMPLETELY. WOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME IN THE STREET?”

“NATURALLY. IT’S NOT A QUESTION OF THAT.”

“DID YOU AT LEAST REMEMBER THE COLOUR OF MY HAIR?”

“OF COURSE. BLONDE.”

SHE BEGINS TO LAUGH.

“YOU’RE REALLY PROUD WHEN YOU SAY THAT. NOW THAT YOU SEE IT. YOU AREN’T WORTH MUCH.”

SHE RUMPLES MY HAIR WITH ONE SWEEP OF HER HAND.

“AND YOU—YOUR HAIR IS RED” SHE SAYS IMITATING ME: “THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU I’LL NEVER FORGET YOU HAD A MAUVISH HOMBURG HAT AND IT SWORE HORRIBLY WITH YOUR RED HAIR. IT WAS HARD TO LOOK AT. WHERE’S YOUR HAT? I WANT TO SEE IF YOUR TASTE IS AS BAD AS EVER.”

“I DON’T WEAR ONE ANY MORE.”

SHE WHISTLES SOFTLY OPENING HER EYES WIDE.

“YOU DIDN’T THINK OF THAT ALL BY YOURSELF! DID YOU? WELL CONGRATULATIONS. OF COURSE! I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED. THAT HAIR CAN’T STAND ANYTHING IT SWEARS WITH HATS CHAIR CUSHIONS EVEN AT A WALLPAPER BACKGROUND. OR ELSE YOU HAVE TO PULL YOUR HAT DOWN OVER YOUR EARS LIKE THAT FELT YOU BOUGHT IN LONDON. YOU TUCKED ALL YOUR HAIR AWAY UNDER THE BRIM. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN BALD FOR ALL ANYONE COULD SEE.”

SHE ADDS IN THE DECISIVE TONE WITH WHICH YOU END OLD QUARRELS:

“IT DIDN’T LOOK AT ALL NICE ON YOU.”

I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAT SHE’S TALKING ABOUT.

“DID I SAY IT LOOKED GOOD ON ME?”

“I SHOULD SAY YOU DID! YOU NEVER TALKED OF ANYTHING ELSE. AND YOU WERE ALWAYS SNEAKING A LOOK IN THE GLASS WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WASN’T WATCHING YOU.”

THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST OVERWHELMS ME. ANNY DOES NOT EVEN SEEM TO BE EVOKING MEMORIES HER TONE OF VOICE DOES NOT HAVE THE TOUCH OF TENDER REMOTENESS SUITABLE TO THAT KIND OF OCCUPATION. SHE SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING OF TODAY RATHER THAN YESTERDAY; SHE HAS KEPT HER OPINIONS HER OBSTINACIES AND HER PAST RESENTMENTS FULLY ALIVE. JUST THE OPPOSITE FOR ME ALL IS DROWNED IN POETIC IMPRESSION; I AM READY FOR ALL CONCESSIONS.

SUDDENLY SHE SAYS IN A TONELESS VOICE:

“YOU SEE I’M GETTING FAT I’M GETTING OLD. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.”

YES. AND HOW WEARY SHE LOOKS! JUST AS I AM ABOUT TO SPEAK SHE ADDS:

“I WAS IN THE THEATRE IN LONDON.”

“WITH CANDLER?”

“NO OF COURSE NOT WITH CANDLER. HOW LIKE YOU! YOU HAD IT IN YOUR HEAD THAT I WAS GOING TO ACT WITH CANDLER. HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TELL YOU THAT CANDLER IS THE ORCHESTRA LEADER? NO IN A LITTLE THEATRE IN SOHO SQUARE. WE PLAYED THE EMPEROR JONES SOME SYNGE AND O’CASEY AND BRITANNICUS.”

“BRITANNICUS?” I SAY AMAZED.

“YES BRITANNICUS. I QUIT BECAUSE OF THAT. I WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE THEM THE IDEA OF PUTTING ON BRITANNICUS AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE ME PLAY JUNIE.”

“REALLY?”

“WELL NATURALLY I COULD ONLY PLAY AGRIPPINE.”

“AND NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”

I WAS WRONG IN ASKING THAT. LIFE FADES ENTIRELY FROM HER FACE. STILL SHE ANSWERS AT ONCE:

“I’M NOT ACTING ANY MORE. I TRAVEL. I’M BEING KEPT.”

SHE SMILES:

“OH DON’T LOOK AT ME IN THAT SOLICITOUS WAY. I ALWAYS TOLD YOU IT DIDN’T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME BEING KEPT. BESIDES HE’S AN OLD MAN HE ISN’T ANY TROUBLE.”

“ENGLISH?”

“WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU?” SHE SAYS IRRITATED. “WE’RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIM. HE HAS NO IMPORTANCE WHATSOEVER FOR YOU OR ME. DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?”

SHE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM. I HEAR HER MOVING AROUND RATTLING CUPS TALKING TO HERSELF; A SHARP UNINTELLIGIBLE MURMUR. ON THE NIGHT-TABLE BY HER BED AS ALWAYS THERE IS A VOLUME OF MICHELET’S HISTORY OF FRANCE. NOW I CAN MAKE OUT A SINGLE PICTURE HUNG ABOVE THE BED A REPRODUCTION OF A PORTRAIT OF EMILY BRONTË DONE BY HER BROTHER.

ANNY RETURNS AND SUDDENLY TELLS ME:

“NOW YOU MUST TALK TO ME ABOUT YOU.”

THEN SHE DISAPPEARS AGAIN INTO THE BATHROOM. I REMEMBER THAT IN SPITE OF MY BAD MEMORY: THAT WAS THE WAY SHE ASKED THOSE DIRECT QUESTIONS WHICH ANNOYED ME SO MUCH BECAUSE I FELT A GENUINE INTEREST AND A DESIRE TO GET THINGS OVER WITH AT THE SAME TIME. IN ANY CASE AFTER THAT QUESTION I KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT SHE WANTS SOMETHING FROM ME. THESE ARE ONLY THE PRELIMINARIES: YOU GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE DISTURBING YOU DEFINITELY RULE OUT SECONDARY QUESTIONS: “NOW YOU MUST TALK TO ME ABOUT YOU.” SOON SHE WILL TALK TO ME ABOUT HERSELF. ALL OF A SUDDEN I NO LONGER HAVE THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO TELL HER ANYTHING. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE? THE NAUSEA THE FEAR EXISTENCE. . . . IT IS BETTER TO KEEP ALL THAT TO MYSELF.

“COME ON HURRY UP” SHE SHOUTS THROUGH THE PARTITION.

SHE RETURNS WITH A TEAPOT.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU LIVING IN PARIS?”

“I LIVE IN BOUVILLE.”

“BOUVILLE? WHY? YOU AREN’T MARRIED I HOPE.”

“MARRIED?” I SAY WITH A START.

IT IS VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO HAVE ANNY THINK THAT. I TELL HER:

“IT’S ABSURD. THAT’S EXACTLY THE SORT OF NATURALISTIC IMAGINATION YOU ACCUSED ME OF BEFORE. YOU KNOW: WHEN I USED TO IMAGINE YOU A WIDOW AND MOTHER OF TWO BOYS. AND ALL THE STORIES I USED TO TELL ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US. YOU HATED IT.”

“AND YOU LIKED IT” SHE ANSWERS UNCONCERNEDLY. “YOU SAID THAT TO PUT ON A BIG ACT. BESIDES EVEN THOUGH YOU GET INDIGNANT IN CONVERSATION YOU’RE TRAITOR ENOUGH TO GET MARRIED ONE DAY ON THE SLY. YOU SWORE INDIGNANTLY FOR A YEAR THAT YOU WOULDN’T SEE VIOLETTES IMPÉRIALES. THEN ONE DAY WHEN I WAS SICK YOU WENT AND SAW IT ALONE IN A CHEAP MOVIE.”

“I AM IN BOUVILLE” I SAY WITH DIGNITY “BECAUSE I AM WRITING A BOOK ON THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON.”

ANNY LOOKS AT ME WITH STUDIED INTEREST.

“ROLLEBON? HE LIVED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY?”

“YES.”

“AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU DID MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT’S A HISTORY BOOK THEN?”

“YES.”

“HA HA!”

IF SHE ASKS ME ONE MORE QUESTION I WILL TELL HER EVERYTHING. BUT SHE ASKS NOTHING MORE. APPARENTLY SHE HAS DECIDED THAT SHE KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT ME. ANNY KNOWS HOW TO BE A GOOD LISTENER BUT ONLY WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE. I WATCH HER: SHE HAS LOWERED HER EYELIDS SHE IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT SHE’S GOING TO TELL ME HOW SHE IS GOING TO BEGIN. DO I HAVE TO QUESTION HER NOW? I DON’T THINK SHE EXPECTS IT. SHE WILL SPEAK WHEN SHE DECIDES IT WILL BE GOOD TO DO SO. MY HEART IS BEATING VERY FAST.

SHE SAYS SUDDENLY:

“I’VE CHANGED.”

THIS IS THE BEGINNING. BUT SHE IS SILENT NOW. SHE POURS TEA INTO THE WHITE PORCELAIN CUPS. SHE IS WAITING FOR ME TO SPEAK: I MUST SAY SOMETHING. NOT JUST ANYTHING IT MUST BE WHAT SHE IS EXPECTING. IT IS TORTURE. HAS SHE REALLY CHANGED? SHE HAS GOTTEN HEAVIER SHE LOOKS TIRED: THAT IS SURELY NOT WHAT SHE MEANS.

“I DON’T KNOW I DON’T THINK SO. I’VE ALREADY FOUND YOUR LAUGH AGAIN YOUR WAY OF GETTING UP AND PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON MY SHOULDERS YOUR MANIA FOR TALKING TO YOURSELF. YOU’RE STILL READING MICHELET’S HISTORY. AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. . . .”

THIS PROFOUND INTEREST WHICH SHE BRINGS TO MY ETERNAL ESSENCE AND HER TOTAL INDIFFERENCE TO ALL THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ME IN THIS LIFE—AND THEN THIS CURIOUS AFFECTATION AT ONCE CHARMING AND PEDANTIC—AND THIS WAY OF SUPPRESSING FROM THE VERY OUTSET ALL THE MECHANICAL FORMULAS OF POLITENESS FRIENDSHIP ALL THAT MAKES RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE EASIER FOREVER OBLIGING HER PARTNERS TO INVENT A RÔLE.

SHE SHRUGS:

“YES I HAVE CHANGED” SHE SAYS DRYLY “I HAVE CHANGED IN EVERY WAY. I’M NOT THE SAME PERSON ANY MORE. I THOUGHT YOU’D NOTICE IT AS SOON AS YOU SAW ME. INSTEAD YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT MICHELET’S HISTORY.”

SHE COMES AND STANDS IN FRONT OF ME.

“WE’LL SEE WHETHER THIS MAN IS AS STRONG AS HE PRETENDS. GUESS: HOW HAVE I CHANGED?”

I HESITATE; SHE TAPS HER FOOT STILL SMILING BUT SINCERELY ANNOYED.

“THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT TORMENTED YOU BEFORE. OR AT LEAST YOU PRETENDED IT DID. AND NOW IT’S GONE DISAPPEARED. YOU SHOULD NOTICE IT. DON’T YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE?”

I DARE ONLY TO ANSWER NO: I AM JUST AS BEFORE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE CHAIR CAREFUL TO AVOID AMBUSHES READY TO CONJURE AWAY INEXPLICABLE RAGES.

SHE SITS DOWN AGAIN.

“WELL” SHE SAYS NODDING HER HEAD WITH CONVICTION “IF YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND IT’S BECAUSE YOU’VE FORGOTTEN THINGS. MORE THAN I THOUGHT. COME ON DON’T YOU REMEMBER YOUR MISDEEDS ANY MORE? YOU CAME YOU SPOKE YOU WENT: ALL CONTRARILY. SUPPOSING NOTHING HAD CHANGED: YOU WOULD HAVE COME IN THERE’D HAVE BEEN MASKS AND SHAWLS ON THE WALL I’D HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE BED AND I’D HAVE SAID (SHE THROWS HER HEAD BACK DILATES HER NOSTRILS AND SPEAKS IN A THEATRICAL VOICE AS IF IN SELF-MOCKERY): WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SIT DOWN.’ AND NATURALLY I’D HAVE CAREFULLY AVOIDED TELLING YOU: “EXCEPT ON THE ARMCHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW.’”

“YOU SET TRAPS FOR ME.”

“THEY WEREN’T TRAPS. . . . SO NATURALLY YOU’D HAVE GONE STRAIGHT OVER AND SAT DOWN.”

“AND WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME?” I ASK TURNING AND LOOKING AT THE ARMCHAIR WITH CURIOSITY.

IT LOOKS ORDINARY IT LOOKS PATERNAL AND COMFORTABLE.

“ONLY SOMETHING BAD” ANNY ANSWERS BRIEFLY.

I LEAVE IT AT THAT: ANNY ALWAYS SURROUNDED HERSELF WITH TABOOS.

“I THINK” I TELL HER SUDDENLY “THAT I GUESS SOMETHING. BUT IT WOULD BE SO EXTRAORDINARY. WAIT LET ME THINK: AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS ROOM IS COMPLETELY BARE. DO ME THE JUSTICE OF ADMITTING THAT I NOTICED IT RIGHT AWAY. ALL RIGHT. I WOULD HAVE COME IN I’D HAVE SEEN THESE MASKS ON THE WALL AND THE SHAWLS AND ALL THAT. THE HOTEL ALWAYS STOPPED AT YOUR DOOR. YOUR ROOM WAS SOMETHING ELSE. . . . YOU WOULDN’T HAVE COME TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME. I’D HAVE SEEN YOU CROUCHED IN A CORNER MAYBE SITTING ON THAT PIECE OF RED CARPET YOU ALWAYS CARRIED WITH YOU LOOKING AT ME PITILESSLY WAITING. . . . I WOULD HAVE HARDLY SAID A WORD MADE A MOVE TAKEN A BREATH BEFORE YOU’D HAVE STARTED FROWNING AND I WOULD HAVE FELT DEEPLY GUILTY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. THEN WITH EVERY MOMENT THAT PASSED I’D HAVE PLUNGED DEEPER INTO ERROR.”

“HOW MANY TIMES HAS THAT HAPPENED?”

“A HUNDRED TIMES.”

“AT LEAST. ARE YOU MORE ADEPT SHARPER NOW?”

“NO!”

“I LIKE TO HEAR YOU SAY IT. WELL THEN?”

“WELL THEN IT’S BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE . . .”

“HA HA!” SHE SHOUTS THEATRICALLY “HE HARDLY DARES BELIEVE IT!”

THEN SHE CONTINUES SOFTLY:

“WELL YOU CAN BELIEVE ME: THERE ARE NO MORE.”

“NO MORE PERFECT MOMENTS?”

“NO.”

I AM DUMFOUNDED. I INSIST.

“YOU MEAN YOU . . . IT’S ALL OVER THOSE . . . TRAGEDIES THOSE INSTANTANEOUS TRAGEDIES WHERE THE MASKS AND SHAWLS THE FURNITURE AND MYSELF . . . WHERE WE EACH HAD A MINOR PART TO PLAY—AND YOU HAD THE LEAD?”

SHE SMILES.

“HE’S UNGRATEFUL. SOMETIMES I GAVE HIM GREATER RÔLES THAN MY OWN: BUT HE NEVER SUSPECTED. WELL YES: IT’S FINISHED. ARE YOU REALLY SURPRISED?”

“YES I’M SURPRISED! I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PART OF YOU THAT IF IT WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TEARING OUT YOUR HEART.”

“I THOUGHT SO TOO” SHE SAYS WITHOUT REGRET. THEN SHE ADDS WITH A SORT OF IRONY THAT AFFECTS ME UNPLEASANTLY:

“BUT YOU SEE I CAN LIVE WITHOUT THAT.”

SHE HAS LACED HER FINGERS AND HOLDS ONE KNEE IN HER HANDS. SHE LOOKS WITH A VAGUE SMILE WHICH REJUVENATES HER WHOLE FACE. SHE LOOKS LIKE A FAT LITTLE GIRL MYSTERIOUS AND SATISFIED.

“YES I’M GLAD YOU’VE STAYED THE SAME. MY MILESTONE. IF YOU’D BEEN MOVED OR REPAINTED OR PLANTED BY THE SIDE OF A DIFFERENT ROAD I WOULD HAVE NOTHING FIXED TO ORIENT MYSELF. YOU ARE INDISPENSABLE TO ME: I CHANGE YOU NATURALLY STAY MOTIONLESS AND I MEASURE MY CHANGES IN RELATION TO YOU.”

I STILL FEEL A LITTLE VEXED.

“WELL THAT’S MOST INACCURATE” I SAY SHARPLY. “ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE BEEN EVOLVING ALL THIS TIME AND AT HEART I . . .”

“OH” SHE SAYS WITH CRUSHING SCORN “INTELLECTUAL CHANGES! I’VE CHANGED TO THE VERY WHITES OF MY EYES.”

TO THE VERY WHITES OF HER EYES. . . . WHAT STARTLES ME ABOUT HER VOICE? ANYHOW I SUDDENLY GIVE A JUMP. I STOP LOOKING FOR AN ANNY WHO ISN’T THERE. THIS IS THE GIRL HERE THIS FAT GIRL WITH A RUINED LOOK WHO TOUCHES ME AND WHOM I LOVE.

“I HAVE A SORT OF . . . PHYSICAL CERTAINTY. I FEEL THERE ARE NO MORE PERFECT MOMENTS. I FEEL IT IN MY LEGS WHEN I WALK. I FEEL IT ALL THE TIME EVEN WHEN I SLEEP. I CAN’T FORGET IT. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE A REVELATION; I CAN’T SAY: STARTING ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY AT SUCH A TIME MY LIFE HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED. BUT NOW I ALWAYS FEEL A BIT AS IF I’D SUDDENLY SEEN IT YESTERDAY. I’M DAZZLED UNCOMFORTABLE I CAN’T GET USED TO IT.”

SHE SAYS THESE WORDS IN A CALM VOICE WITH A TOUCH OF PRIDE AT HAVING CHANGED. SHE BALANCES HERSELF ON THE CHEST WITH EXTRAORDINARY GRACE. NOT ONCE SINCE I CAME HAS SHE MORE STRONGLY RESEMBLED THE ANNY OF BEFORE THE ANNY OF MARSEILLES. SHE HAS CAUGHT ME AGAIN ONCE MORE I HAVE PLUNGED INTO HER STRANGE UNIVERSE BEYOND RIDICULE AFFECTATION SUBTLETY. I HAVE EVEN RECOVERED THE LITTLE FEVER THAT ALWAYS STIRRED IN ME WHEN I WAS WITH HER AND THIS BITTER TASTE IN THE BACK OF MY MOUTH.

ANNY UNCLASPS HER HANDS AND DROPS HER KNEE. SHE IS SILENT. A CONCERTED SILENCE AS WHEN AT THE OPERA THE STAGE IS EMPTY FOR EXACTLY SEVEN MEASURES OF MUSIC. SHE DRINKS HER TEA. THEN SHE PUTS DOWN HER CUP AND HOLDS HERSELF STIFFLY LEANING HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE BACK OF THE CHEST.

SUDDENLY SHE PUTS ON HER SUPERB LOOK OF MEDUSA WHICH I LOVED SO MUCH ALL SWOLLEN WITH HATE TWISTED VENOMOUS. ANNY HARDLY CHANGES EXPRESSION; SHE CHANGES FACES; AS THE ACTORS OF ANTIQUITY CHANGED MASKS: SUDDENLY. AND EACH ONE OF THE MASKS IS DESTINED TO CREATE ATMOSPHERE TO GIVE TONE TO WHAT FOLLOWS. IT APPEARS AND STAYS WITHOUT MODIFICATION AS SHE SPEAKS. THEN IT FALLS DETACHED FROM HER.

SHE STARES AT ME WITHOUT SEEMING TO SEE ME. SHE IS GOING TO SPEAK. I EXPECT A TRAGIC SPEECH HEIGHTENED TO THE DIGNITY OF HER MASK A FUNERAL ORATION.

SHE DOES NOT SAY A SINGLE WORD.

“I OUTLIVE MYSELF.”

THE TONE DOES NOT CORRESPOND IN ANY WAY TO HER FACE. IT IS NOT TRAGIC IT IS . . . HORRIBLE: IT EXPRESSES A DRY DESPAIR WITHOUT TEARS WITHOUT PITY. YES SOMETHING IN HER HAS IRREMEDIABLY DRIED OUT.

THE MASKS FALLS SHE SMILES.

“I’M NOT AT ALL SAD. I AM OFTEN AMAZED AT IT BUT I WAS WRONG: WHY SHOULD I BE SAD? I USED TO BE CAPABLE OF RATHER SPLENDID PASSIONS. I HATED MY MOTHER PASSIONATELY. AND YOU” SHE SAYS DEFIANTLY “I LOVED YOU PASSIONATELY.”

SHE WAITS FOR AN ANSWER. I SAY NOTHING.

“ALL THAT IS OVER OF COURSE.”

“HOW CAN YOU TELL?”

“I KNOW. I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER AGAIN MEET ANYTHING OR ANYBODY WHO WILL INSPIRE ME WITH PASSION. YOU KNOW IT’S QUITE A JOB STARTING TO LOVE SOMEBODY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENERGY GENEROSITY BLINDNESS. THERE IS EVEN A MOMENT IN THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN YOU HAVE TO JUMP ACROSS A PRECIPICE: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU DON’T DO IT. I KNOW I’LL NEVER JUMP AGAIN.”

“WHY?”

SHE LOOKS AT ME IRONICALLY AND DOES NOT ANSWER.

“NOW” SHE SAYS “I LIVE SURROUNDED WITH MY DEAD PASSIONS. I TRY TO RECAPTURE THE FINE FURY THAT THREW ME OFF THE FOURTH FLOOR WHEN I WAS TWELVE THE DAY MY MOTHER WHIPPED ME.”

SHE ADDS WITH APPARENT INCONSEQUENCE AND A FAR-AWAY LOOK:

“IT ISN’T GOOD FOR ME TO STARE AT THINGS TOO LONG. I LOOK AT THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE THEN I HAVE TO TURN MY EYES AWAY QUICKLY.”

“WHY?”

“THEY DISGUST ME.”

IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM . . . THERE ARE SURELY SIMILARITIES IN ANY CASE. IT HAPPENED ONCE IN LONDON WE HAD SEPARATELY THOUGHT THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECTS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME. I’D LIKE SO MUCH TO . . . BUT ANNY’S MIND TAKES MANY TURNINGS YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE YOU’VE UNDERSTOOD HER COMPLETELY. I MUST GET TO THE HEART OF IT.

“LISTEN I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU KNOW I NEVER QUITE KNEW WHAT PERFECT MOMENTS WERE; YOU NEVER EXPLAINED THEM TO ME.”

“YES I KNOW. YOU MADE ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT. YOU SAT BESIDE ME LIKE A LUMP ON A LOG.”

“I KNOW WHAT IT COST ME.”

“YOU DESERVED EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU YOU WERE VERY WICKED; YOU ANNOYED ME WITH YOUR STOLID LOOK. YOU SEEMED TO SAY: I’M NORMAL; AND YOU PRACTICALLY BREATHED HEALTH YOU DRIPPED WITH MORAL WELL-BEING.”

“STILL I MUST HAVE ASKED YOU A HUNDRED TIMES AT LEAST WHAT A . . .”

“YES BUT IN WHAT A TONE OF VOICE” SHE SAYS ANGRILY; “YOU CONDESCENDED TO INFORM YOURSELF AND THAT’S THE WHOLE TRUTH. YOU WERE KINDLY AND DISTRAIT LIKE THE OLD LADIES WHO USED TO ASK ME WHAT I WAS PLAYING WHEN I WAS LITTLE. AT HEART” SHE SAYS DREAMILY “I WONDER IF YOU WEREN’T THE ONE I HATED MOST.”

SHE MAKES A GREAT EFFORT TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SMILES HER CHEEKS STILL FLAMING. SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL.

“I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY ARE. I’M OLD ENOUGH NOW TO TALK CALMLY TO OLD WOMEN LIKE YOU ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD GAMES. GO AHEAD TALK WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?”

“WHAT THEY WERE.”

“I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS?”

“I DON’T THINK SO.”

“YES” SHE SAYS WITH ASSURANCE. “IT WAS IN AIX IN THAT SQUARE I DON’T REMEMBER THE NAME ANY MORE. WE WERE IN THE COURTYARD OF A CAFÉ IN THE SUN UNDER ORANGE PARASOLS. YOU DON’T REMEMBER: WE DRANK LEMONADE AND I FOUND A DEAD FLY IN THE POWDERED SUGAR.”

“AH YES MAYBE . . .”

“WELL I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THAT IN THE CAFÉ. I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT À PROPOS OF THE BIG EDITION OF MICHELET’S HISTORY THE ONE I HAD WHEN I WAS LITTLE. IT WAS A LOT BIGGER THAN THIS ONE AND THE PAGES WERE LIVID LIKE THE INSIDE OF A MUSHROOM. WHEN MY FATHER DIED MY UNCLE JOSEPH GOT HIS HANDS ON IT AND TOOK AWAY ALL THE VOLUMES. THAT WAS THE DAY I CALLED HIM A DIRTY PIG AND MY MOTHER WHIPPED ME AND I JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW.”

“YES YES . . . YOU MUST HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THAT HISTORY OF FRANCE. . . . DIDN’T YOU READ IT IN THE ATTIC? YOU SEE I REMEMBER. YOU SEE YOU WERE UNJUST WHEN YOU ACCUSED ME OF FORGETTING EVERYTHING A LITTLE WHILE AGO.”

“BE QUIET. YES AS YOU REMEMBER SO WELL I CARRIED THOSE ENORMOUS BOOKS TO THE ATTIC. THERE WERE VERY FEW PICTURES IN THEM MAYBE THREE OR FOUR IN EACH VOLUME. BUT EACH ONE HAD A BIG PAGE ALL TO ITSELF AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PAGE WAS BLANK. THAT HAD MUCH MORE EFFECT ON ME THAN THE OTHER PAGES WHERE THEY’D ARRANGED THE TEXT IN TWO COLUMNS TO SAVE SPACE. I HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY LOVE FOR THOSE PICTURES; I KNEW THEM ALL BY HEART AND WHENEVER I READ ONE OF MICHELET’S BOOKS I’D WAIT FOR THEM FIFTY PAGES IN ADVANCE; IT ALWAYS SEEMED A MIRACLE TO FIND THEM AGAIN. AND THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER: THE SCENE THEY SHOWED NEVER HAD ANY RELATION TO THE TEXT ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU HAD TO GO LOOKING FOR THE EVENT THIRTY PAGES FARTHER ON.”

“I BEG YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE PERFECT MOMENTS.”

“I’M TALKING ABOUT PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS. THEY WERE THE ONES THE PICTURES TOLD ABOUT. I CALLED THEM PRIVILEGED I TOLD MYSELF THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY IMPORTANT TO BE MADE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH RARE PICTURES. THEY HAD BEEN CHOSEN ABOVE ALL THE OTHERS DO YOU UNDERSTAND: AND YET THERE WERE MANY EPISODES WHICH HAD A GREATER PLASTIC VALUE OTHERS WITH A GREATER HISTORICAL INTEREST. FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE ONLY THREE PICTURES FOR THE WHOLE SIXTEENTH CENTURY: ONE FOR THE DEATH OF HENRI II ONE FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE DUC DE GUISE AND ONE FOR THE ENTRY OF HENRI IV INTO PARIS. THEN I IMAGINED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THESE EVENTS. THE PICTURES CONFIRMED THE IDEA: THE DRAWINGS WERE BAD THE ARMS AND LEGS WERE NEVER TOO WELL ATTACHED TO THE BODIES. BUT IT WAS FULL OF GRANDEUR. WHEN THE DUC DE GUISE WAS ASSASSINATED FOR EXAMPLE THE SPECTATORS SHOWED THEIR AMAZEMENT AND INDIGNATION BY STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS AND TURNING THEIR FACES AWAY LIKE A CHORUS. AND DON’T THINK THEY LEFT OUT ANY PLEASANT DETAILS. YOU COULD SEE PAGES FALLING TO THE GROUND LITTLE DOGS RUNNING AWAY JESTERS SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE THRONE. BUT ALL THESE DETAILS WERE TREATED WITH SO MUCH GRANDEUR AND SO MUCH CLUMSINESS THAT THEY WERE IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH THE REST OF THE PICTURE: I DON’T THINK I’VE EVER COME ACROSS PICTURES THAT HAD SUCH A STRICT UNITY. WELL THEY CAME FROM THERE.”

“THE PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS?”

“THE IDEA I HAD OF THEM. THEY WERE SITUATIONS WHICH HAD A RARE AND PRECIOUS QUALITY STYLE IF YOU LIKE. TO BE KING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD SEEMED A PRIVILEGED SITUATION TO ME. OR TO DIE. YOU MAY LAUGH BUT THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE DRAWN AT THE MOMENT OF THEIR DEATH AND SO MANY WHO SPOKE SUCH SUBLIME WORDS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I QUITE GENUINELY THOUGHT . . . WELL I THOUGHT THAT BY DYING YOU WERE TRANSPORTED ABOVE YOURSELF. BESIDES IT WAS ENOUGH JUST TO BE IN THE ROOM OF A DYING PERSON: DEATH BEING A PRIVILEGED SITUATION SOMETHING EMANATED FROM IT AND COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO EVERYONE THERE. A SORT OF GRANDEUR. WHEN MY FATHER DIED THEY TOOK ME UP TO HIS ROOM TO SEE HIM FOR THE LAST TIME. I WAS VERY UNHAPPY GOING UP THE STAIRS BUT I WAS ALSO DRUNK WITH A SORT OF RELIGIOUS ECSTASY; I WAS FINALLY ENTERING A PRIVILEGED SITUATION. I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL I TRIED TO MAKE THE PROPER MOTIONS. BUT MY AUNT AND MOTHER WERE KNEELING BY THE BED AND THEY SPOILED IT ALL BY CRYING.”

SHE SAYS THESE LAST WORDS WITH ANGER AS IF THE MEMORY STILL SCORCHED HER. SHE INTERRUPTS HERSELF; EYES STARING EYEBROWS RAISED SHE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION TO LIVE THE SCENE ONCE MORE.

“I DEVELOPED ALL THAT LATER ON: FIRST I ADDED A NEW SITUATION LOVE (I MEAN THE ACT OF LOVE). LOOK IF YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY I REFUSED . . . CERTAIN OF YOUR DEMANDS HERE’S YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND NOW: FOR ME THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE SAVED. THEN I TOLD MYSELF THAT THERE SHOULD BE MANY MORE PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS THAN I COULD COUNT FINALLY I ADMITTED AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THEM.”

“YES BUT WHAT WERE THEY?”

“BUT I’VE TOLD YOU” SHE SAYS WITH AMAZEMENT “I’VE BEEN EXPLAINING TO YOU FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES.”

“WELL WAS IT ESPECIALLY NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO BE IMPASSIONED CARRIED AWAY BY HATRED OR LOVE FOR EXAMPLE; OR DID THE EXTERIOR ASPECT OF THE EVENT HAVE TO BE GREAT I MEAN—WHAT YOU COULD SEE OF IT. . . .”

“BOTH . . . IT ALL DEPENDED” SHE ANSWERS UNGRACIOUSLY.

“AND THE PERFECT MOMENTS? WHERE DO THEY COME IN?”

“THEY CAME AFTERWARDS. FIRST THERE ARE ANNUNCIATORY SIGNS. THEN THE PRIVILEGED SITUATION SLOWLY MAJESTICALLY COMES INTO PEOPLE’S LIVES. THEN THE QUESTION WHETHER YOU WANT TO MAKE A PERFECT MOMENT OUT OF IT.”

“YES” I SAY “I UNDERSTAND. IN EACH ONE OF THESE PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTS WHICH HAVE TO BE DONE CERTAIN ATTITUDES TO BE TAKEN WORDS WHICH MUST BE SAID—AND OTHER ATTITUDES OTHER WORDS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED. IS THAT IT?”

“I SUPPOSE SO. . . .”

“IN FACT THEN THE SITUATION IS THE MATERIAL: IT DEMANDS EXPLOITATION.”

“THAT’S IT” SHE SAYS. “FIRST YOU HAD TO BE PLUNGED INTO SOMETHING EXCEPTIONAL AND FEEL AS THOUGH YOU WERE PUTTING IT IN ORDER. IF ALL THOSE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN REALIZED THE MOMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT.”

“IN FACT IT WAS A SORT OF WORK OF ART.”

“YOU’VE ALREADY SAID THAT” SHE SAYS WITH IRRITATION. “NO: IT WAS . . . A DUTY. YOU HAD TO TRANSFORM PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS INTO PERFECT MOMENTS. IT WAS A MORAL QUESTION. YES YOU CAN LAUGH IF YOU LIKE: IT WAS MORAL.”

I AM NOT LAUGHING AT ALL.

“LISTEN” I SAY SPONTANEOUSLY “I’M GOING TO ADMIT MY SHORTCOMINGS TOO. I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD YOU I NEVER SINCERELY TRIED TO HELP YOU. IF I HAD KNOWN . . .”

“THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH” SHE SAYS IRONICALLY. “I HOPE YOU’RE NOT EXPECTING RECOGNITION FOR YOUR DELAYED REGRETS. BESIDES I HOLD NOTHING AGAINST YOU; I NEVER EXPLAINED ANYTHING TO YOU CLEARLY I WAS ALL IN KNOTS I COULDN’T TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT NOT EVEN YOU—ESPECIALLY NOT YOU. THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT RANG FALSE AT THOSE MOMENTS. THEN I WAS LOST. BUT I STILL HAD THE FEELING I WAS DOING EVERYTHING I COULD.”

“BUT WHAT HAD TO BE DONE? WHAT ACTIONS?”

“WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE. I CAN’T GIVE YOU ANY EXAMPLES IT ALL DEPENDS.”

“BUT TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO.”

“NO I DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. BUT HERE’S A STORY IF YOU LIKE A STORY THAT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON ME WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL. THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD LOST A BATTLE AND WAS TAKEN PRISONER. HE WAS THERE OFF IN A CORNER IN THE VICTOR’S CAMP. HE SAW HIS SON AND DAUGHTER PASS BY IN CHAINS. HE DIDN’T WEEP HE DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING. THEN HE SAW ONE OF HIS SERVANTS PASS BY IN CHAINS TOO. THEN HE BEGAN TO GROAN AND TEAR OUT HIS HAIR. YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN EXAMPLES. YOU SEE: THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU MUSTN’T CRY—OR ELSE YOU’LL BE UNCLEAN. BUT IF YOU DROP A LOG ON YOUR FOOT YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE GROAN CRY JUMP AROUND ON THE OTHER FOOT. IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO BE STOICAL ALL THE TIME: YOU’D WEAR YOURSELF OUT FOR NOTHING.”

SHE SMILES:

“OTHER TIMES YOU MUST BE MORE THAN STOICAL. NATURALLY YOU DON’T REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I KISSED YOU?”

“YES VERY CLEARLY” I SAY TRIUMPHANTLY “IT WAS IN KEW GARDENS BY THE BANKS OF THE THAMES.”

“BUT WHAT YOU NEVER KNEW WAS THAT I WAS SITTING ON A PATCH OF NETTLES: MY DRESS WAS UP MY THIGHS WERE COVERED WITH STINGS AND EVERY TIME I MADE THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT I WAS STUNG AGAIN. WELL STOICISM WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN ENOUGH THERE. YOU DIDN’T BOTHER ME AT ALL I HAD NO PARTICULAR DESIRE FOR YOUR LIPS THE KISS I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IT WAS AN ENGAGEMENT A PACT. SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PAIN WAS IRRELEVANT I WASN’T ALLOWED TO THINK ABOUT MY THIGHS AT A TIME LIKE THAT. IT WASN’T ENOUGH NOT TO SHOW MY SUFFERING: IT WAS NECESSARY NOT TO SUFFER.”

SHE LOOKS AT ME PROUDLY STILL SURPRISED AT WHAT SHE HAD DONE.

“FOR MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES ALL THE TIME YOU WERE INSISTING ON HAVING THE KISS I HAD DECIDED TO GIVE YOU ALL THE TIME I HAD YOU BEGGING ME—BECAUSE I HAD TO GIVE IT TO YOU ACCORDING TO FORM—I MANAGED TO ANAESTHETIZE MYSELF COMPLETELY. AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE A SENSITIVE SKIN: I FELT NOTHING UNTIL WE GOT UP.”

THAT’S IT. THERE ARE NO ADVENTURES—THERE ARE NO PERFECT MOMENTS . . . WE HAVE LOST THE SAME ILLUSIONS WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE SAME PATHS. I CAN GUESS THE REST—I CAN EVEN SPEAK FOR HER AND TELL MYSELF ALL THAT SHE HAS LEFT TO TELL:

“SO YOU REALIZED THAT THERE WERE ALWAYS WOMEN IN TEARS OR A RED-HEADED MAN OR SOMETHING ELSE TO SPOIL YOUR EFFECTS?”

“YES NATURALLY” SHE ANSWERS WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM.

“ISN’T THAT IT?”

“OH YOU KNOW I MIGHT HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF IN THE END TO THE CLUMSINESS OF A RED-HEADED MAN. AFTER ALL I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE PLAYED THEIR PARTS . . . NO IT’S THAT . . .”

“THAT THERE ARE NO MORE PRIVILEGED SITUATIONS?”

“THAT’S IT. I USED TO THINK THAT HATE OR LOVE OR DEATH DESCENDED ON US LIKE TONGUES OF FIRE ON GOOD FRIDAY. I THOUGHT ONE COULD RADIATE HATE OR DEATH. WHAT A MISTAKE! YES I REALLY THOUGHT THAT ‘HATE’ EXISTED THAT IT CAME OVER PEOPLE AND RAISED THEM ABOVE THEMSELVES. NATURALLY I AM THE ONLY ONE I AM THE ONE WHO HATES WHO LOVES. BUT IT’S ALWAYS THE SAME THING A PIECE OF DOUGH THAT GETS LONGER AND LONGER . . . EVERYTHING LOOKS SO MUCH ALIKE THAT YOU WONDER HOW PEOPLE GOT THE IDEA OF INVENTING NAMES TO MAKE DISTINCTIONS.”

SHE THINKS AS I DO. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I HAD NEVER LEFT HER.

“LISTEN CAREFULLY” I SAY “FOR THE PAST MOMENT I’VE BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING THAT PLEASES ME MUCH MORE THAN THE RÔLE OF A MILESTONE YOU GENEROUSLY GAVE ME TO PLAY: IT’S THAT WE’VE CHANGED TOGETHER AND IN THE SAME WAY. I LIKE THAT BETTER YOU KNOW THAN TO SEE YOU GOING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY AND BEING CONDEMNED TO MARK YOUR POINT OF DEPARTURE FOREVER. ALL THAT YOU’VE TOLD ME—I CAME TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING—THOUGH WITH OTHER WORDS OF COURSE. WE MEET AT THE ARRIVAL. I CAN’T TELL YOU HOW PLEASED I AM.”

“YES?” SHE SAYS GENTLY BUT WITH AN OBSTINATE LOOK. “WELL I’D STILL HAVE LIKED IT BETTER IF YOU HADN’T CHANGED; IT WAS MORE CONVENIENT. I’M NOT LIKE YOU IT RATHER DISPLEASES ME TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAS THOUGHT THE SAME THINGS I HAVE. BESIDES YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.”

I TELL HER MY ADVENTURES I TELL HER ABOUT EXISTENCE—PERHAPS AT TOO GREAT LENGTH. SHE LISTENS CAREFULLY HER EYES WIDE OPEN AND HER EYEBROWS RAISED.

WHEN I FINISH SHE LOOKS SOOTHED.

“WELL YOU’RE NOT THINKING LIKE ME AT ALL. YOU COMPLAIN BECAUSE THINGS DON’T ARRANGE THEMSELVES AROUND YOU LIKE A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS WITHOUT YOUR TAKING THE SLIGHTEST TROUBLE TO DO ANYTHING. BUT I HAVE NEVER ASKED AS MUCH: I WANTED ACTION. YOU KNOW WHEN WE PLAYED ADVENTURER AND ADVENTURESS: YOU WERE THE ONE WHO HAD ADVENTURES I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THEM HAPPEN. I SAID: I’M A MAN OF ACTION. REMEMBER? WELL NOW I SIMPLY SAY: ONE CAN’T BE A MAN OF ACTION.”

I COULDN’T HAVE LOOKED CONVINCED BECAUSE SHE BECAME ANIMATED AND BEGAN AGAIN WITH MORE ENERGY:

“THEN THERE’S A HEAP OF THINGS I HAVEN’T TOLD YOU BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN. FOR EXAMPLE I HAD TO BE ABLE TO TELL MYSELF AT THE VERY MOMENT I TOOK ACTION THAT WHAT I WAS DOING WOULD HAVE . . . FATAL RESULTS. I CAN’T EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU VERY WELL. . . .”

“IT’S QUITE USELESS” I SAY SOMEWHAT PEDANTICALLY” “I’VE THOUGHT THAT TOO.”

SHE LOOKS AT ME WITH SCORN.

“YOU’D LIKE ME TO BELIEVE YOU’VE THOUGHT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY I HAVE: YOU REALLY AMAZE ME.”

I CAN’T CONVINCE HER ALL I DO IS IRRITATE HER. I KEEP QUIET. I WANT TO TAKE HER IN MY ARMS.

SUDDENLY SHE LOOKS AT ME ANXIOUSLY:

“WELL IF YOU’VE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THAT WHAT CAN YOU DO?”

I BOW MY HEAD.

“I . . . I OUTLIVE MYSELF” SHE REPEATS HEAVILY.

WHAT CAN I TELL HER? DO I KNOW ANY REASONS FOR LIVING? I’M NOT AS DESPERATE AS SHE IS BECAUSE I DIDN’T EXPECT MUCH. I’M RATHER . . . AMAZED BEFORE THIS LIFE WHICH IS GIVEN TO ME—GIVEN FOR NOTHING. I KEEP MY HEAD BOWED I DON’T WANT TO SEE ANNY’S FACE NOW.

“I TRAVEL” SHE GOES ON GLOOMILY; “I’M JUST BACK FROM SWEDEN. I STOPPED IN BERLIN FOR A WEEK. THIS MAN WHO’S KEEPING ME . . .”

TAKE HER IN MY ARMS? WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO? I CAN DO NOTHING FOR HER; SHE IS AS SOLITARY AS I.

“WHAT ARE YOU MUTTERING ABOUT?”

I RAISE MY EYES. SHE IS WATCHING ME TENDERLY.

“NOTHING. I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING.”

“OH? MYSTERIOUS PERSON! WELL TALK OR BE QUIET BUT DO ONE OR THE OTHER.”

I TELL HER ABOUT THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” THE OLD RAGTIME I HAD PLAYED ON THE PHONOGRAPH THE STRANGE HAPPINESS IT GIVES ME.

“I WAS WONDERING IF IN THAT DIRECTION ONE COULDN’T FIND OR LOOK FOR . . .”

SHE DOESN’T ANSWER I DON’T THINK SHE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN WHAT I TOLD HER.

STILL AFTER A MOMENT SHE SPEAKS AGAIN—AND I DON’T KNOW WHETHER SHE IS FOLLOWING HER OWN IDEAS OR WHETHER IT IS AN ANSWER TO WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD HER.

“PAINTINGS STATUES CAN’T BE USED: THEY’RE LOVELY FACING ME. MUSIC . . .”

“BUT THE THEATRE . . .”

“WHAT ABOUT THE THEATRE? DO YOU WANT TO ENUMERATE ALL THE FINE ARTS?”

“BEFORE YOU USED TO SAY YOU WANTED TO ACT BECAUSE ON THE STAGE YOU HAD TO REALIZE PERFECT MOMENTS!”

“YES I REALIZED THEM: FOR THE OTHERS. I WAS IN THE DUST IN THE DRAUGHT UNDER RAW LIGHTS BETWEEN CARDBOARD SETS. I USUALLY PLAYED WITH THORNDYKE. I THINK YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HIM AT COVENT GARDEN. I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID I’D BURST OUT LAUGHING IN HIS FACE.”

“BUT WEREN’T YOU EVER CARRIED AWAY BY YOUR PART?”

“A LITTLE SOMETIMES: NEVER VERY STRONGLY. THE ESSENTIAL THING FOR ALL OF US WAS THE BLACK PIT JUST IN FRONT OF US IN THE BOTTOM OF IT THERE WERE PEOPLE YOU DIDN’T SEE; OBVIOUSLY YOU WERE PRESENTING THEM WITH A PERFECT MOMENT. BUT YOU KNOW THEY DIDN’T LIVE IN IT: IT UNFOLDED IN FRONT OF THEM. AND WE THE ACTORS DO YOU THINK WE LIVED INSIDE IT? IN THE END IT WASN’T ANYWHERE NOT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS IT DIDN’T EXIST; AND YET EVERYBODY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. SO YOU SEE LITTLE MAN” SHE SAYS IN A DRAGGING ALMOST VULGAR TONE OF VOICE “I WALKED OUT ON THE WHOLE BUSINESS.”

“I TRIED TO WRITE A BOOK . . .”

SHE INTERRUPTS ME.

“I LIVE IN THE PAST. I TAKE EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND ARRANGE IT. FROM A DISTANCE LIKE THAT IT DOESN’T DO ANY HARM YOU’D ALMOST LET YOURSELF BE CAUGHT IN IT. OUR WHOLE STORY IS FAIRLY BEAUTIFUL. I GIVE IT A FEW PRODS AND IT MAKES A WHOLE STRING OF PERFECT MOMENTS. THEN I CLOSE MY EYES AND TRY TO IMAGINE THAT I’M STILL LIVING INSIDE IT. I HAVE OTHER CHARACTERS TOO. . . . YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO CONCENTRATE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I READ? LOYOLA’S SPIRITUAL EXERCISES. IT HAS BEEN QUITE USEFUL FOR ME. THERE’S A WAY OF FIRST SETTING UP THE BACKGROUND THEN MAKING CHARACTERS APPEAR. YOU MANAGE TO SEE” SHE ADDS WITH A MANIACAL AIR.

“WELL” I SAY “THAT WOULDN’T SATISFY ME AT ALL.”

“DO YOU THINK IT SATISFIES ME?”

WE STAY SILENT FOR A MOMENT. EVENING IS COMING ON; I CAN HARDLY MAKE OUT THE PALE SPOT OF HER FACE. HER BLACK DRESS MELTS WITH THE SHADOW WHICH FLOODS THE ROOM. I PICK UP MY CUP MECHANICALLY THERE’S A LITTLE TEA LEFT IN IT AND I BRING IT TO MY LIPS. THE TEA IS COLD. I WANT TO SMOKE BUT I DON’T DARE. I HAVE THE TERRIBLE FEELING THAT WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER. ONLY YESTERDAY I HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK HER: WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WHAT SHE HAD DONE WHOM SHE HAD MET. BUT THAT INTERESTED ME ONLY IN SO FAR AS ANNY GAVE HER WHOLE HEART TO IT. NOW I AM WITHOUT CURIOSITY: ALL THESE COUNTRIES ALL THESE CITIES SHE HAS PASSED THROUGH ALL THE MEN WHO HAVE COURTED HER AND WHOM SHE HAS PERHAPS LOVED—SHE CLUNG TO NONE OF THAT AT HEART SHE WAS INDIFFERENT TO IT ALL: LITTLE FLASHES OF SUN ON THE SURFACE OF A COLD DARK SEA. ANNY IS SITTING OPPOSITE TO ME WE HAVEN’T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR FOUR YEARS AND WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

“YOU’LL HAVE TO LEAVE NOW” ANNY SAYS SUDDENLY “I’M EXPECTING SOMEONE.”

“YOU’RE WAITING FOR . . .”

“NO I’M WAITING FOR A GERMAN A PAINTER.”

SHE BEGINS TO LAUGH. THIS LAUGH RINGS STRANGELY IN THE DIM ROOM.

“THERE’S SOMEONE WHO ISN’T LIKE US—NOT YET. HE ACTS HE SPENDS HIMSELF.”

I GET UP RELUCTANTLY.

“WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN?”

“I DON’T KNOW I’M LEAVING FOR LONDON TOMORROW EVENING.”

“BY DIEPPE?”

“YES AND I THINK I’LL GO TO EGYPT AFTER THAT. MAYBE I’LL BE BACK IN PARIS NEXT WINTER I’LL WRITE YOU.”

“I’LL BE FREE ALL DAY TOMORROW” I SAY TIMIDLY.

“YES BUT I HAVE A LOT TO DO” SHE ANSWERS DRYLY. “NO I CAN’T SEE YOU. I’LL WRITE YOU FROM EGYPT. JUST GIVE ME YOUR ADDRESS.”

“YES.”

IN THE SHADOW I SCRIBBLE MY ADDRESS ON AN ENVELOPE. I HAVE TO PUT DOWN HOTEL PRINTANIA SO THEY CAN FORWARD MY LETTERS WHEN I LEAVE BOUVILLE. YET I KNOW VERY WELL THAT SHE WON’T WRITE. PERHAPS I SHALL SEE HER AGAIN IN TEN YEARS. PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL SEE HER. I AM NOT ONLY OVERWHELMED AT LEAVING HER; I HAVE A FRIGHTFUL FEAR OF GOING BACK TO MY SOLITUDE AGAIN.

SHE GETS UP; AT THE DOOR SHE KISSES ME LIGHTLY ON THE MOUTH.

“TO REMEMBER YOUR LIPS” SHE SAYS SMILING. “I HAVE TO REFRESH MY MEMORIES FOR MY SPIRITUAL EXERCISES.”

I TAKE HER BY THE ARM AND DRAW HER TO ME. SHE DOES NOT RESIST BUT SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

“NO. THAT DOESN’T INTEREST ME ANY MORE. YOU CAN’T BEGIN AGAIN. . . . AND BESIDES FOR WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORTH THE FIRST GOOD-LOOKING BOY THAT COMES ALONG IS WORTH AS MUCH AS YOU.”

“WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN?”

“I TOLD YOU I’M GOING TO ENGLAND.”

“NO I MEAN . . .”

“NOTHING!”

I HAVEN’T LET GO OF HER ARMS I TELL HER GENTLY:

“THEN I MUST LEAVE YOU AFTER FINDING YOU AGAIN.”

I CAN SEE HER FACE CLEARLY NOW. SUDDENLY IT GROWS PALE AND DRAWN. AN OLD WOMAN’S FACE ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTFUL; I’M SURE SHE DIDN’T PUT THAT ONE ON PURPOSELY: IT IS THERE UNKNOWN TO HER OR PERHAPS IN SPITE OF HER.

“NO” SHE SAYS SLOWLY “NO. YOU HAVEN’T FOUND ME AGAIN.”

SHE PULLS HER ARMS AWAY. SHE OPENS THE DOOR. THE HALL IS SPARKLING WITH LIGHT.

ANNY BEGINS TO LAUGH.

“POOR BOY! HE NEVER HAS ANY LUCK. THE FIRST TIME HE PLAYS HIS PART WELL HE GETS NO THANKS FOR IT. GET OUT.”

I HEAR THE DOOR CLOSE BEHIND ME.

SUNDAY:

THIS MORNING I CONSULTED THE RAILWAY GUIDE: ASSUMING THAT SHE HASN’T LIED TO ME THE DIEPPE TRAIN WILL LEAVE AT 5.38. BUT MAYBE HER MAN WILL BE DRIVING HER. I WANDERED AROUND MENILMONTANT ALL MORNING THEN THE QUAYS IN THE AFTERNOON. A FEW STEPS A FEW WALLS SEPARATE ME FROM HER. AT 5:38 OUR CONVERSATION OF YESTERDAY WILL BECOME A MEMORY THE OPULENT WOMAN WHOSE LIPS BRUSHED AGAINST MY MOUTH WILL REJOIN IN THE PAST THE SLIM LITTLE GIRL OF MEKNES OF LONDON. BUT NOTHING WAS PAST YET SINCE SHE WAS STILL THERE SINCE IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO SEE HER AGAIN TO PERSUADE HER TO TAKE HER AWAY WITH ME FOREVER. I DID NOT FEEL ALONE YET.

I WANTED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT ANNY BECAUSE IMAGINING HER BODY AND HER FACE SO MUCH I HAD FALLEN INTO A STATE OF EXTREME NERVOUSNESS: MY HANDS TREMBLED AND ICY CHILLS SHOOK ME. I BEGAN TO LOOK THROUGH THE BOOKS ON DISPLAY AT SECOND-HAND STALLS ESPECIALLY OBSCENE ONES BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT OCCUPIES YOUR MIND.

WHEN THE GARE D’ORSAY CLOCK STRUCK FIVE I WAS LOOKING AT THE PICTURES IN A BOOK ENTITLED THE DOCTOR WITH THE WHIP. THERE WAS LITTLE VARIETY: IN MOST OF THEM A HEAVY BEARDED MAN WAS BRANDISHING A RIDING WHIP OVER MONSTROUS NAKED RUMPS. AS SOON AS I REALIZED IT WAS FIVE O’CLOCK I THREW THE BOOK BACK ON THE PILE AND JUMPED INTO A TAXI WHICH TOOK ME TO THE GARE SAINT-LAZARE.

I WALKED AROUND THE PLATFORM FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES THEN I SAW THEM. SHE WAS WEARING A HEAVY FUR COAT WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE A LADY. AND A SHORT VEIL. THE MAN HAD ON A CAMEL’S-HAIR COAT. HE WAS TANNED STILL YOUNG VERY BIG VERY HANDSOME. A FOREIGNER SURELY BUT NOT ENGLISH; POSSIBLY EGYPTIAN. THEY GOT ON THE TRAIN WITHOUT SEEING ME. THEY DID NOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. THEN THE MAN GOT OFF AND BOUGHT NEWSPAPERS. ANNY HAD LOWERED THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT; SHE SAW ME. SHE LOOKED AT ME FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANGER WITH INEXPRESSIVE EYES. THEN THE MAN GOT BACK INTO THE COMPARTMENT AND THE TRAIN LEFT. AT THAT MOMENT I CLEARLY SAW THE RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY WHERE WE USED TO EAT BEFORE THEN EVERYTHING WENT BLANK. I WALKED. WHEN I FELT TIRED I CAME INTO THIS CAFÉ AND WENT TO SLEEP. THE WAITER HAS JUST WAKENED ME AND I AM WRITING THIS WHILE HALF-ASLEEP.

TOMORROW I SHALL TAKE THE NOON TRAIN BACK TO BOUVILLE. TWO DAYS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH TO PACK MY BAGS AND STRAIGHTEN OUT MY ACCOUNTS AT THE BANK. I THINK THE HOTEL PRINTANIA WILL WANT ME TO PAY TWO WEEKS EXTRA BECAUSE I DIDN’T GIVE THEM NOTICE. THEN I HAVE TO RETURN ALL THE BOOKS I BORROWED FROM THE LIBRARY. IN ANY CASE I’LL BE BACK IN PARIS BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK.

WILL I GAIN ANYTHING BY THE CHANGE? IT IS STILL A CITY: THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE CUT IN TWO BY A RIVER THE OTHER ONE IS BY THE SEA YET THEY LOOK ALIKE. ONE TAKES A PIECE OF BARE STERILE EARTH AND ONE ROLLS BIG HOLLOW STONES ON TO IT. ODOURS ARE HELD CAPTIVE IN THESE STONES ODOURS HEAVIER THAN AIR. SOMETIMES PEOPLE THROW THEM OUT OF THE WINDOWS INTO THE STREETS AND THEY STAY THERE UNTIL THE WIND BREAKS THEM APART. IN CLEAR WEATHER NOISES COME IN ONE END OF THE CITY AND GO OUT THE OTHER AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE WALLS; AT OTHER TIMES THE NOISES WHIRL AROUND INSIDE THESE SUN-BAKED ICE-SPLIT STONES.

I AM AFRAID OF CITIES. BUT YOU MUSTN’T LEAVE THEM. IF YOU GO TOO FAR YOU COME UP AGAINST THE VEGETATION BELT. VEGETATION HAS CRAWLED FOR MILES TOWARDS THE CITIES. IT IS WAITING. ONCE THE CITY IS DEAD THE VEGETATION WILL COVER IT WILL CLIMB OVER THE STONES GRIP THEM SEARCH THEM MAKE THEM BURST WITH ITS LONG BLACK PINCERS; IT WILL BLIND THE HOLES AND LET ITS GREEN PAWS HANG OVER EVERYTHING. YOU MUST STAY IN THE CITIES AS LONG AS THEY ARE ALIVE YOU MUST NEVER PENETRATE ALONE THIS GREAT MASS OF HAIR WAITING AT THE GATES; YOU MUST LET IT UNDULATE AND CRACK ALL BY ITSELF. IN THE CITIES IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND CHOOSE THE TIMES WHEN ALL THE BEASTS ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR HOLES AND DIGESTING BEHIND THE HEAPS OF ORGANIC DEBRIS YOU RARELY COME ACROSS ANYTHING MORE THAN MINERALS THE LEAST FRIGHTENING OF ALL EXISTANTS.

I AM GOING BACK TO BOUVILLE. THE VEGETATION HAS ONLY SURROUNDED THREE SIDES OF IT. ON THE FOURTH SIDE THERE IS A GREAT HOLE FULL OF BLACK WATER WHICH MOVES ALL BY ITSELF. THE WIND WHISTLES BETWEEN THE HOUSES. THE ODOURS STAY LESS TIME THERE THAN ANYWHERE: CHASED OUT TO SEA BY THE WIND THEY RACE ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE BLACK WATER LIKE PLAYFUL MISTS. IT RAINS. THEY LET PLANTS GROW BETWEEN THE GRATINGS. CASTRATED DOMESTICATED SO FAT THAT THEY ARE HARMLESS. THEY HAVE ENORMOUS WHITISH LEAVES WHICH HANG LIKE EARS. WHEN YOU TOUCH THEM IT FEELS LIKE CARTILAGE EVERYTHING IS FAT AND WHITE IN BOUVILLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE WATER THAT FALLS FROM THE SKY. I AM GOING BACK TO BOUVILLE. HOW HORRIBLE!

I WAKE UP WITH A START. IT IS MIDNIGHT. ANNY LEFT PARIS SIX HOURS AGO. THE BOAT IS ALREADY AT SEA. SHE IS SLEEPING IN A CABIN AND UP ON DECK THE HANDSOME BRONZE MAN IS SMOKING CIGARETTES.

TUESDAY IN BOUVILLE:

IS THAT WHAT FREEDOM IS? BELOW ME THE GARDENS GO LIMPLY DOWN TOWARDS THE CITY AND A HOUSE RISES UP FROM EACH GARDEN. I SEE THE OCEAN HEAVY MOTIONLESS I SEE BOUVILLE. IT IS A LOVELY DAY.

I AM FREE: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO MORE REASON FOR LIVING ALL THE ONES I HAVE TRIED HAVE GIVEN WAY AND I CAN’T IMAGINE ANY MORE OF THEM. I AM STILL FAIRLY YOUNG I STILL HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO START AGAIN. BUT DO I HAVE TO START AGAIN? HOW MUCH IN THE STRONGEST OF MY TERRORS MY DISGUSTS I HAD COUNTED ON ANNY TO SAVE ME I REALIZED ONLY NOW. MY PAST IS DEAD. THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON IS DEAD ANNY CAME BACK ONLY TO TAKE ALL HOPE AWAY. I AM ALONE IN THIS WHITE GARDEN-RIMMED STREET. ALONE AND FREE. BUT THIS FREEDOM IS RATHER LIKE DEATH.

TODAY MY LIFE IS ENDING. BY TOMORROW I WILL HAVE LEFT THIS TOWN WHICH SPREADS OUT AT MY FEET WHERE I HAVE LIVED SO LONG. IT WILL BE NOTHING MORE THAN A NAME SQUAT BOURGEOIS QUITE FRENCH A NAME IN MY MEMORY NOT AS RICH AS THE NAMES OF FLORENCE OR BAGDAD. A TIME WILL COME WHEN I SHALL WONDER: WHATEVER COULD I HAVE DONE ALL DAY LONG WHEN I WAS IN BOUVILLE? NOTHING WILL BE LEFT OF THIS SUNLIGHT THIS AFTERNOON NOT EVEN A MEMORY.

MY WHOLE LIFE IS BEHIND ME. I SEE IT COMPLETELY I SEE ITS SHAPE AND THE SLOW MOVEMENTS WHICH HAVE BROUGHT ME THIS FAR. THERE IS LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT IT: A LOST GAME THAT’S ALL. THREE YEARS AGO I CAME SOLEMNLY TO BOUVILLE. I HAD LOST THE FIRST ROUND. I WANTED TO PLAY THE SECOND AND I LOST AGAIN: I LOST THE WHOLE GAME. AT THE SAME TIME I LEARNED THAT YOU ALWAYS LOSE. ONLY THE RASCALS THINK THEY WIN. NOW I AM GOING TO BE LIKE ANNY I AM GOING TO OUTLIVE MYSELF. EAT SLEEP SLEEP EAT. EXIST SLOWLY SOFTLY LIKE THESE TREES LIKE A PUDDLE OF WATER LIKE THE RED BENCH IN THE STREETCAR.

THE NAUSEA HAS GIVEN ME A SHORT BREATHING SPELL. BUT I KNOW IT WILL COME BACK AGAIN: IT IS MY NORMAL STATE. ONLY TODAY MY BODY IS TOO EXHAUSTED TO STAND IT. INVALIDS ALSO HAVE HAPPY MOMENTS OF WEAKNESS WHICH TAKE AWAY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR ILLNESS FOR A FEW HOURS. I AM BORED THAT’S ALL. FROM TIME TO TIME I YAWN SO WIDELY THAT TEARS ROLL DOWN MY CHEEK. IT IS A PROFOUND BOREDOM PROFOUND THE PROFOUND HEART OF EXISTENCE THE VERY MATTER I AM MADE OF. I DO NOT NEGLECT MYSELF QUITE THE CONTRARY: THIS MORNING I TOOK A BATH AND SHAVED. ONLY WHEN I THINK BACK OVER THOSE CAREFUL LITTLE ACTIONS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THEM: THEY ARE SO VAIN. HABIT NO DOUBT MADE THEM FOR ME. THEY AREN’T DEAD THEY KEEP ON BUSYING THEMSELVES GENTLY INSIDIOUSLY WEAVING THEIR WEBS THEY WASH ME DRY ME DRESS ME LIKE NURSES. DID THEY ALSO LEAD ME TO THIS HILL? I CAN’T REMEMBER HOW I CAME ANY MORE. PROBABLY UP THE ESCALIER DAUTRY: DID I REALLY CLIMB UP ITS HUNDRED AND TEN STEPS ONE BY ONE? WHAT IS PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE IS THAT I AM SOON GOING TO CLIMB DOWN AGAIN. YET I KNOW I AM: IN A MOMENT I SHALL FIND MYSELF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COTEAU VERT IF I RAISE MY HEAD SEE IN THE DISTANCE THE LIGHTING WINDOWS OF THESE HOUSES WHICH ARE SO CLOSE NOW. IN THE DISTANCE. ABOVE MY HEAD; ABOVE MY HEAD; AND THIS INSTANT WHICH I CANNOT LEAVE WHICH LOCKS ME IN AND LIMITS ME ON EVERY SIDE THIS INSTANT I AM MADE OF WILL BE NO MORE THAN A CONFUSED DREAM.

I WATCH THE GREY SHIMMERINGS OF BOUVILLE AT MY FEET. IN THE SUN THEY LOOK LIKE HEAPS OF SHELLS SCALES SPLINTERS OF BONE AND GRAVEL. LOST IN THE MIDST OF THIS DEBRIS TINY GLIMMERS OF GLASS OR MICA INTERMITTENTLY THROW OFF LIGHT FLAMES. IN AN HOUR THE RIPPLES TRENCHES AND THIN FURROWS WHICH RUN BETWEEN THESE SHELLS WILL BE STREETS I SHALL WALK IN THESE STREETS BETWEEN THESE WALLS. THESE LITTLE BLACK MEN I CAN JUST MAKE OUT IN THE RUE BOULIBET—IN AN HOUR I SHALL BE ONE OF THEM.

I FEEL SO FAR AWAY FROM THEM ON THE TOP OF THIS HILL. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH I BELONG TO ANOTHER SPECIES. THEY COME OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AFTER THEIR DAY OF WORK THEY LOOK AT THE HOUSES AND THE SQUARES WITH SATISFACTION THEY THINK IT IS THEIR CITY A GOOD SOLID BOURGEOIS CITY. THEY AREN’T AFRAID THEY FEEL AT HOME. ALL THEY HAVE EVER SEEN IS TRAINED WATER RUNNING FROM TAPS LIGHT WHICH FILLS BULBS WHEN YOU TURN ON THE SWITCH HALF-BREED BASTARD TREES HELD UP WITH CRUTCHES. THEY HAVE PROOF A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENS MECHANICALLY THAT THE WORLD OBEYS FIXED UNCHANGEABLE LAWS. IN A VACUUM ALL BODIES FALL AT THE SAME RATE OF SPEED THE PUBLIC PARK IS CLOSED AT 4 P.M. IN WINTER AT 6 P.M. IN SUMMER LEAD MELTS AT 335 DEGREES CENTIGRADE THE LAST STREETCAR LEAVES THE HOTEL DE VILLE AT 11.05 P.M. THEY ARE PEACEFUL A LITTLE MOROSE THEY THINK ABOUT TOMORROW THAT IS TO SAY SIMPLY A NEW TODAY; CITIES HAVE ONLY ONE DAY AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND EVERY MORNING IT COMES BACK EXACTLY THE SAME. THEY SCARCELY DOLL IT UP A BIT ON SUNDAYS. IDIOTS. IT IS REPUGNANT TO ME TO THINK THAT I AM GOING TO SEE THEIR THICK SELF-SATISFIED FACES. THEY MAKE LAWS THEY WRITE POPULAR NOVELS THEY GET MARRIED THEY ARE FOOLS ENOUGH TO HAVE CHILDREN. AND ALL THIS TIME GREAT VAGUE NATURE HAS SLIPPED INTO THEIR CITY IT HAS INFILTRATED EVERYWHERE IN THEIR HOUSE IN THEIR OFFICE IN THEMSELVES. IT DOESN’T MOVE IT STAYS QUIETLY AND THEY ARE FULL OF IT INSIDE THEY BREATHE IT AND THEY DON’T SEE IT THEY IMAGINE IT TO BE OUTSIDE TWENTY MILES FROM THE CITY. I SEE IT I SEE THIS NATURE . . . I KNOW THAT ITS OBEDIENCE IS IDLENESS I KNOW IT HAS NO LAWS: WHAT THEY TAKE FOR CONSTANCY IS ONLY HABIT AND IT CAN CHANGE TOMORROW.

WHAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN? WHAT IF SOMETHING SUDDENLY STARTED THROBBING? THEN THEY WOULD NOTICE IT WAS THERE AND THEY’D THINK THEIR HEARTS WERE GOING TO BURST. THEN WHAT GOOD WOULD THEIR DYKES BULWARKS POWER HOUSES FURNACES AND PILE DRIVERS BE TO THEM? IT CAN HAPPEN ANY TIME PERHAPS RIGHT NOW: THE OMENS ARE PRESENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE FATHER OF A FAMILY MIGHT GO OUT FOR A WALK AND ACROSS THE STREET HE’LL SEE SOMETHING LIKE A RED RAG BLOWN TOWARDS HIM BY THE WIND. AND WHEN THE RAG HAS GOTTEN CLOSE TO HIM HE’LL SEE THAT IT IS A SIDE OF ROTTEN MEAT GRIMY WITH DUST DRAGGING ITSELF ALONG BY CRAWLING SKIPPING A PIECE OF WRITHING FLESH ROLLING IN THE GUTTER SPASMODICALLY SHOOTING OUT SPURTS OF BLOOD. OR A MOTHER MIGHT LOOK AT HER CHILD’S CHEEK AND ASK HIM: “WHAT’S THAT—A PIMPLE?” AND SEE THE FLESH PUFF OUT A LITTLE SPLIT OPEN AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SPLIT AN EYE A LAUGHING EYE MIGHT APPEAR. OR THEY MIGHT FEEL THINGS GENTLY BRUSHING AGAINST THEIR BODIES LIKE THE CARESSES OF REEDS TO SWIMMERS IN A RIVER. AND THEY WILL REALIZE THAT THEIR CLOTHING HAS BECOME LIVING THINGS. AND SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT FEEL SOMETHING SCRATCHING IN HIS MOUTH. HE GOES TO THE MIRROR OPENS HIS MOUTH: AND HIS TONGUE IS AN ENORMOUS LIVE CENTIPEDE RUBBING ITS LEGS TOGETHER AND SCRAPING HIS PALATE. HE’D LIKE TO SPIT IT OUT BUT THE CENTIPEDE IS A PART OF HIM AND HE WILL HAVE TO TEAR IT OUT WITH HIS OWN HANDS. AND A CROWD OF THINGS WILL APPEAR FOR WHICH PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO FIND NEW NAMES—STONE-EYE GREAT THREE-CORNERED ARM TOE-CRUTCH SPIDER-JAW. AND SOMEONE MIGHT BE SLEEPING IN HIS COMFORTABLE BED IN HIS QUIET WARM ROOM AND WAKE UP NAKED ON A BLUISH EARTH IN A FOREST OF RUSTLING BIRCH TREES RISING RED AND WHITE TOWARDS THE SKY LIKE THE SMOKESTACKS OF JOUXTEBOUVILLE WITH BIG BUMPS HALF-WAY OUT OF THE GROUND HAIRY AND BULBOUS LIKE ONIONS. AND BIRDS WILL FLY AROUND THESE BIRCH TREES AND PICK AT THEM WITH THEIR BEAKS AND MAKE THEM BLEED. SPERM WILL FLOW SLOWLY GENTLY FROM THESE WOUNDS SPERM MIXED WITH BLOOD WARM AND GLASSY WITH LITTLE BUBBLES. OR ELSE NOTHING LIKE THAT WILL HAPPEN THERE WILL BE NO APPRECIABLE CHANGE BUT ONE MORNING PEOPLE WILL OPEN THEIR BLINDS AND BE SURPRISED BY A SORT OF FRIGHTFUL SIXTH SENSE BROODING HEAVILY OVER THINGS AND SEEMING TO PAUSE. NOTHING MORE THAN THAT: BUT FOR THE LITTLE TIME IT LASTS THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF SUICIDES. YES! LET IT CHANGE JUST A LITTLE JUST TO SEE I DON’T ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER. THEN YOU WILL SEE OTHER PEOPLE SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO SOLITUDE. MEN ALL ALONE COMPLETELY ALONE WITH HORRIBLE MONSTROSITIES WILL RUN THROUGH THE STREETS PASS HEAVILY IN FRONT OF ME THEIR EYES STARING FLEEING THEIR ILLS YET CARRYING THEM WITH THEM OPEN-MOUTHED WITH THEIR INSECT-TONGUE FLAPPING ITS WINGS. THEN I’LL BURST OUT LAUGHING EVEN THOUGH MY BODY MAY BE COVERED WITH FILTHY INFECTED SCABS WHICH BLOSSOM INTO FLOWERS OF FLESH VIOLETS BUTTERCUPS. I’LL LEAN AGAINST A WALL AND WHEN THEY GO BY I’LL SHOUT: “WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOUR SCIENCE? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR HUMANISM? WHERE IS YOUR DIGNITY?” I WILL NOT BE AFRAID—OR AT LEAST NO MORE THAN NOW. WILL IT NOT STILL BE EXISTENCE VARIATIONS ON EXISTENCE? ALL THESE EYES WHICH WILL SLOWLY DEVOUR A FACE—THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE TOO MUCH BUT NO MORE SO THAN THE FIRST TWO EXISTENCE IS WHAT I AM AFRAID OF.

EVENING FALLS THE FIRST LAMPS ARE LIT IN THE CITY. MY GOD! HOW NATURAL THE CITY LOOKS DESPITE ALL ITS GEOMETRIES HOW CRUSHED IT LOOKS IN THE EVENING. IT’S SO . . . SO EVIDENT FROM HERE; COULD I BE THE ONLY ONE TO SEE IT? IS THERE NOWHERE ANOTHER CASSANDRA ON THE SUMMIT OF A HILL WATCHING A CITY ENGULFED IN THE DEPTHS OF NATURE? BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? WHAT COULD I TELL HER?

MY BODY SLOWLY TURNS EASTWARD OSCILLATES A LITTLE AND BEGINS TO WALK.

WEDNESDAY: MY LAST DAY IN BOUVILLE:

I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER TOWN FOR THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN. HE SURELY HASN’T GONE HOME. HE MUST BE WALKING AT RANDOM FILLED WITH SHAME AND HORROR—THIS POOR HUMANIST WHOM MEN DON’T WANT. TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS HARDLY SURPRISED WHEN THE THING HAPPENED: FOR A LONG TIME I HAD THOUGHT THAT HIS SOFT TIMID FACE WOULD BRING SCANDAL ON ITSELF. HE WAS SO LITTLE GUILTY: HIS HUMBLE CONTEMPLATIVE LOVE FOR YOUNG BOYS IS HARDLY SENSUALITY—RATHER A FORM OF HUMANITY. BUT ONE DAY HE HAD TO FIND HIMSELF ALONE. LIKE M. ACHILLE LIKE ME: HE IS ONE OF MY RACE HE HAS GOOD WILL. NOW HE HAS ENTERED INTO SOLITUDE—FOREVER. EVERYTHING SUDDENLY CRUMBLED HIS DREAMS OF CULTURE HIS DREAMS OF AN UNDERSTANDING WITH MANKIND. FIRST THERE WILL BE FEAR HORROR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND THEN AFTER THAT THE LONG SUCCESSION OF DAYS OF EXILE. IN THE EVENING HE WILL COME BACK TO WANDER AROUND THE COUR DES HYPOTHÈQUES; FROM A DISTANCE HE WILL WATCH THE GLOWING WINDOWS OF THE LIBRARY AND HIS HEART WILL FAIL HIM WHEN HE REMEMBERS THE LONG ROWS OF BOOKS THEIR LEATHER BINDINGS THE SMELL OF THEIR PAGES. I AM SORRY I DIDN’T GO ALONG WITH HIM BUT HE DIDN’T WANT ME TO; HE BEGGED ME TO LET HIM ALONE: HE WAS BEGINNING HIS APPRENTICESHIP IN SOLITUDE. I AM WRITING THIS IN THE CAFÉ MABLY. I WENT IN WITH GREAT CEREMONY I WANTED TO STUDY THE MANAGER THE CASHIER AND FORCIBLY FEEL THAT I WAS SEEING THEM FOR THE LAST TIME. BUT I CAN’T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN I STILL HAVE HIS OPEN FACE BEFORE MY EYES HIS FACE FULL OF REPROACH HIS BLOOD-STAINED COLLAR. SO I ASKED FOR SOME PAPER AND I AM GOING TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

I WENT TO THE LIBRARY ABOUT TWO O’CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON. I WAS THINKING: “THE LIBRARY. I AM GOING IN HERE FOR THE LAST TIME.”

THE ROOM WAS ALMOST DESERTED. IT HURT ME TO SEE IT BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD NEVER COME BACK. IT WAS LIGHT AS MIST ALMOST UNREAL ALL REDDISH; THE SETTING SUN RUSTED THE TABLE RESERVED FOR WOMEN THE DOOR THE BACK OF THE BOOKS. FOR A SECOND I HAD THE DELIGHTFUL FEELING THAT I WAS GOING INTO UNDERBRUSH FULL OF GOLDEN LEAVES; I SMILED. I THOUGHT: I HAVEN’T SMILED FOR A LONG TIME. THE CORSICAN WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK. WHAT DID HE SEE? THE SKULL OF IMPÉTRAZ? I SHALL NEVER SEE THAT SKULL AGAIN OR HIS TOP HAT OR HIS MORNING COAT. IN SIX HOURS I WILL HAVE LEFT BOUVILLE. I PUT THE TWO BOOKS I BORROWED LAST MONTH ON THE ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN’S DESK. HE TORE UP A GREEN SLIP AND HANDED ME THE PIECES:

“THERE YOU ARE MONSIEUR ROQUETIN.”

“THANK YOU.”

I THOUGHT: NOW I OWE THEM NOTHING MORE. I DON’T OWE ANY THING MORE TO ANYBODY HERE. SOON I’M GOING TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE WOMAN IN THE “RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS” I AM FREE. I HESITATED A FEW INSTANTS: WOULD I USE THESE LAST MOMENTS TO TAKE A LONG WALK THROUGH BOUVILLE TO SEE THE BOULEVARD VICTOR-NOIR AGAIN THE AVENUE GALVANI AND THE RUE TOURNEBRIDE. BUT THIS FOREST WAS SO CALM SO PURE: IT SEEMED TO ME AS THOUGH IT HARDLY EXISTED AND THAT THE NAUSEA HAD SPARED IT. I WENT AND SAT DOWN NEAR THE STOVE. THE JOURNAL DE BOUVILLE WAS LYING ON THE TABLE. I REACHED OUT AND TOOK IT.

“SAVED BY HIS DOG.”

“YESTERDAY EVENING M. DUBOSC OF REMIREDON WAS BICYCLING HOME FROM THE NAUGIS FAIR. . .”

A FAT WOMAN SAT DOWN AT MY RIGHT. SHE PUT HER FELT HAT BESIDE HER. HER NOSE WAS PLANTED ON HER FACE LIKE A KNIFE IN AN APPLE. UNDER THE NOSE A SMALL OBSCENE HOLE WRINKLED DISDAINFULLY. SHE TOOK A BOUND BOOK FROM HER BAG LEANED HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE RESTING HER FACE AGAINST HER FAT HANDS. AN OLD MAN WAS SLEEPING OPPOSITE ME. I KNEW HIM: HE WAS IN THE LIBRARY THE EVENING I WAS SO FRIGHTENED. I THINK HE WAS AFRAID TOO. I THOUGHT: HOW FAR AWAY ALL THAT IS.

AT FOUR-FIFTEEN THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN CAME IN. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHAKE HANDS AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM. BUT I THOUGHT OUR LAST MEETING MUST HAVE LEFT HIM WITH UNPLEASANT MEMORIES: HE NODDED DISTANTLY TO ME AND FAR ENOUGH AWAY HE SET DOWN A SMALL WHITE PACKAGE WHICH PROBABLY CONTAINED AS USUAL A SLICE OF BREAD AND A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE. AFTER A MOMENT HE CAME BACK WITH AN ILLUSTRATED BOOK WHICH HE PLACED NEAR HIS PACKAGE. I THOUGHT: I AM SEEING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME. TOMORROW EVENING THE EVENING AFTER TOMORROW AND ALL THE FOLLOWING EVENINGS HE WILL RETURN TO READ AT THIS TABLE EATING HIS BREAD AND CHOCOLATE HE WILL PATIENTLY KEEP ON WITH HIS RAT’S NIBBLING HE WILL READ THE WORKS OF NABAUD NAUDEAU NODIER NYS INTERRUPTING HIMSELF FROM TIME TO TIME TO JOT DOWN A MAXIM IN HIS NOTEBOOK. AND I WILL BE WALKING IN PARIS IN PARIS STREETS I WILL BE SEEING NEW FACES. WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME WHILE HE WOULD STILL BE HERE WITH THE LAMP LIGHTING UP HIS HEAVY PONDERING FACE. I FELT MYSELF DRIFTING BACK TO THE MIRAGE OF ADVENTURE JUST IN TIME. I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS AND BEGAN READING AGAIN.

TWO BOYS WITH SATCHELS COME IN. STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH-SCHOOL. THE CORSICAN LIKES STUDENTS FROM THE HIGH-SCHOOL BECAUSE HE CAN EXERCISE A PATERNAL SUPERVISION OVER THEM. OFTEN FOR HIS OWN PLEASURE HE LETS THEM STIR AROUND ON THEIR CHAIRS AND TALK THEN SUDDENLY TIPTOES UP BEHIND THEM AND SCOLDS: “IS THAT THE WAY BIG BOYS BEHAVE? IF YOU DON’T BEHAVE YOURSELVES THE LIBRARIAN IS GOING TO COMPLAIN TO YOUR HEADMASTER.”

AND IF THEY PROTEST HE LOOKS AT THEM WITH TERRIBLE EYES: “GIVE ME YOUR NAMES.” HE ALSO DIRECTS THEIR READING: IN THE LIBRARY CERTAIN VOLUMES ARE MARKED WITH A RED CROSS; HELL: THE WORKS OF GIDE DIDEROT BAUDELAIRE AND MEDICAL TEXTS. WHEN A STUDENT WANTS TO CONSULT ONE OF THESE BOOKS THE CORSICAN MAKES A SIGN TO HIM DRAWS HIM OVER TO A CORNER AND QUESTIONS HIM. AFTER A MOMENT HE EXPLODES AND HIS VOICE FILLS THE READING-ROOM: “THERE ARE A LOT OF MORE INTERESTING BOOKS FOR A BOY OF YOUR AGE. INSTRUCTIVE BOOKS. HAVE YOU FINISHED YOUR HOMEWORK? WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN? AND YOU DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO AFTER FOUR O’CLOCK? YOUR TEACHER COMES IN HERE A LOT AND I’M GOING TO TELL HIM ABOUT YOU.”

THE TWO BOYS STAY NEAR THE STOVE. THE YOUNGER ONE HAS BROWN HAIR A SKIN ALMOST TOO FINE AND A TINY MOUTH WICKED AND PROUD. HIS FRIEND A BIG HEAVY-SET BOY WITH THE SHADOW OF A MOUSTACHE TOUCHED HIS ELBOW AND MURMURED A FEW WORDS. THE LITTLE BROWN-HAIRED BOY DID NOT ANSWER BUT HE GAVE AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE FULL OF ARROGANCE AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY. THEN BOTH OF THEM NONCHALANTLY CHOSE A DICTIONARY FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AND WENT OVER TO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WHO WAS STARING WEARILY AT THEM. THEY SEEMED TO IGNORE HIS EXISTENCE BUT THEY SAT DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO HIM THE BROWN-HAIRED BOY ON HIS LEFT AND THE THICKSET ONE ON THE LEFT OF THE BROWN-HAIRED BOY. THEY BEGAN LOOKING THROUGH THE DICTIONARY. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S LOOK WANDERED OVER THE ROOM THEN RETURNED TO HIS READING. NEVER HAD A LIBRARY OFFERED SUCH A REASSURING SPECTACLE: I HEARD NO SOUND EXCEPT THE SHORT BREATHING OF THE FAT WOMAN I ONLY SAW HEADS BENT OVER BOOKS. YET AT THAT MOMENT I HAD THE FEELING THAT SOMETHING UNPLEASANT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO LOWERED THEIR EYES WITH SUCH A STUDIOUS LOOK SEEMED TO BE PLAYING A COMEDY: A FEW INSTANTS BEFORE I FELT SOMETHING LIKE A BREATH OF CRUELTY PASS OVER US.

I HAD FINISHED READING BUT HADN’T DECIDED TO LEAVE: I WAS WAITING PRETENDING TO READ MY NEWSPAPER. WHAT INCREASED MY CURIOSITY AND ANNOYANCE WAS THAT THE OTHERS WERE WAITING TOO. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH MY NEIGHBOUR WAS TURNING THE PAGES OF HER BOOK MORE RAPIDLY. A FEW MINUTES PASSED THEN I HEARD WHISPERING. I CAUTIOUSLY RAISED MY HEAD. BOTH BOYS HAD CLOSED THEIR DICTIONARIES. THE BROWN-HAIRED ONE WAS NOT TALKING HIS FACE STAMPED WITH DEFERENCE AND INTEREST WAS TURNED TO THE RIGHT. HALF-HIDDEN BEHIND HIS SHOULDER THE BLOND WAS LISTENING AND LAUGHING SILENTLY. WHO’S TALKING? I THOUGHT.

IT WAS THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN. HE WAS BENT OVER HIS YOUNG NEIGHBOUR EYE TO EYE SMILING AT HIM; I SAW HIS LIPS MOVE AND FROM TIME TO TIME HIS LONG EYELASHES PALPITATE. I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE THIS LOOK OF YOUTHFULNESS; HE WAS ALMOST CHARMING. BUT FROM TIME TO TIME HE INTERRUPTED HIMSELF AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY BEHIND HIM. THE BOY SEEMED TO DRINK HIS WORDS. THERE WAS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THIS LITTLE SCENE AND I WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO MY READING WHEN I SAW THE BOY SLOWLY SLIDE HIS HAND BEHIND HIS BACK ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE. THUS HIDDEN FROM THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S EYES IT WENT ON ITS WAY FOR A MOMENT AND BEGAN TO FEEL AROUND THEN FINDING THE ARM OF THE BIGGER BOY PINCHED IT VIOLENTLY. THE OTHER TOO ABSORBED IN SILENT ENJOYMENT OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S WORDS HAD NOT SEEN IT COMING. HE JUMPED UP AND HIS MOUTH OPENED WIDELY IN SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION. THE BROWN-HAIRED BOY HAD KEPT HIS LOOK OF RESPECTFUL INTEREST. ONE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED THAT THIS MISCHIEVOUS HAND BELONGED TO HIM. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO TO HIM? I THOUGHT. I KNEW THAT SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND I SAW TOO THAT THERE WAS STILL TIME TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING. BUT I COULDN’T GUESS WHAT THERE WAS TO PREVENT. FOR A SECOND I HAD THE IDEA OF GETTING UP SLAPPING THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN ON THE SHOULDER AND STARTING A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. BUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT MY LOOK. HE STOPPED SPEAKING AND PINCHED HIS LIPS TOGETHER WITH AN AIR OF IRRITATION. DISCOURAGED I QUICKLY LOWERED MY EYES AND MADE A SHOW OF READING MY PAPER. HOWEVER THE FAT WOMAN HAD SET DOWN HER BOOK AND RAISED HER HEAD. SHE SEEMED HYPNOTIZED. I FELT SURE THE WOMAN WAS GOING TO BURST: THEY ALL WANTED SOMETHING TO BURST. WHAT COULD I DO? I GLANCED AT THE CORSICAN: HE WASN’T LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW ANY MORE HE HAD TURNED HALF-WAY TOWARDS US.

FIFTEEN MINUTES PASSED. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN HAD BEGUN HIS WHISPERING AGAIN. I DIDN’T DARE LOOK AT HIM ANY MORE BUT I COULD WELL IMAGINE HIS YOUNG AND TENDER AIR AND THOSE HEAVY LOOKS WHICH WEIGHED ON HIM WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT. ONCE I HEARD HIS LAUGH A FLUTED CHILDISH LITTLE LAUGH. IT GRIPPED MY HEART: IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE TWO KIDS WERE GOING TO DROWN A CAT. THEN THE WHISPERS STOPPED SUDDENLY. THIS SILENCE SEEMED TRAGIC TO ME: IT WAS THE END THE DEATHBLOW. I BOWED MY HEAD OVER MY NEWSPAPER AND PRETENDED TO READ; BUT I WASN’T READING: I RAISED MY EYES AS HIGH AS I COULD TRYING TO CATCH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THIS SILENCE ACROSS FROM ME. BY TURNING MY HEAD SLIGHTLY I COULD SEE SOMETHING OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE: IT WAS A HAND THE SMALL WHITE HAND WHICH SLID ALONG THE TABLE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. NOW IT WAS RESTING ON ITS BACK RELAXED SOFT AND SENSUAL IT HAD THE INDOLENT NUDITY OF A WOMAN SUNNING HERSELF AFTER BATHING. A BROWN HAIRY OBJECT APPROACHED IT HESITANT. IT WAS A THICK FINGER YELLOWED BY TOBACCO; INSIDE THIS HAND IT HAD ALL THE GROSSNESS OF A MALE SEX ORGAN. IT STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT RIGID POINTING AT THE FRAGILE PALM THEN SUDDENLY IT TIMIDLY BEGAN TO STROKE IT. I WAS NOT SURPRISED I WAS ONLY FURIOUS AT THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN; COULDN’T HE HOLD HIMSELF BACK THE FOOL DIDN’T HE REALIZE THE RISK HE WAS RUNNING? HE STILL HAD A CHANCE A SMALL CHANCE: IF HE WERE TO PUT BOTH HANDS ON THE TABLE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOOK IF HE STAYED ABSOLUTELY STILL PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE HIS DESTINY THIS TIME. BUT I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO MISS HIS CHANCE: THE FINGER PASSED SLOWLY HUMBLY OVER THE INERT FLESH BARELY GRAZING IT WITHOUT DARING TO PUT ANY WEIGHT ON IT: YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CONSCIOUS OF ITS UGLINESS. I RAISED MY HEAD BRUSQUELY I COULDN’T STAND THIS OBSTINATE LITTLE BACK-AND-FORTH MOVEMENT ANY MORE: I TRIED TO CATCH THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S EYE AND I COUGHED LOUDLY TO WARN HIM. BUT HE CLOSED HIS EYES HE WAS SMILING. HIS OTHER HAND HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE TABLE. THE BOYS WERE NOT LAUGHING ANY MORE THEY HAD BOTH TURNED PALE. THE BROWN-HAIRED ONE PINCHED HIS LIPS HE WAS AFRAID HE LOOKED AS THOUGH WHAT WAS HAPPENING HAD GONE BEYOND HIS CONTROL. BUT HE DID NOT DRAW HIS HAND AWAY HE LEFT IT ON THE TABLE MOTIONLESS A LITTLE CURLED. HIS FRIEND’S MOUTH WAS OPEN IN A STUPID HORRIFIED LOOK.

THEN THE CORSICAN BEGAN TO SHOUT. HE HAD COME UP WITHOUT ANYONE HEARING HIM AND PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S CHAIR. HE WAS CRIMSON AND LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO LAUGH BUT HIS EYES WERE FLASHING. I STARTED UP FROM MY CHAIR BUT I FELT ALMOST RELIEVED: THE WAITING WAS TOO UNBEARABLE. I WANTED IT TO BE OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I WANTED THEM TO THROW HIM OUT IF THEY WANTED BUT GET IT OVER WITH. THE TWO BOYS WHITE AS SHEETS SEIZED THEIR SATCHELS AND DISAPPEARED.

“I SAW YOU” THE CORSICAN SHOUTED DRUNK WITH FURY “I SAW YOU THIS TIME DON’T TRY AND TELL ME IT ISN’T TRUE. DON’T THINK I’M NOT WISE TO YOUR LITTLE GAME I’VE GOT EYES IN MY HEAD. AND THIS IS GOING TO COST YOU PLENTY. I KNOW YOUR NAME I KNOW YOUR ADDRESS I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU I KNOW YOUR BOSS CHUILLIER. AND WON’T HE BE SURPRISED TOMORROW MORNING WHEN HE GETS A LETTER FROM THE LIBRARIAN. WHAT? SHUT UP!” HE SAID HIS EYES ROLLING. “AND DON’T THINK IT’S GOING TO STOP THERE. WE HAVE COURTS IN FRANCE FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. SO YOU WERE STUDYING SO YOU WERE GETTING CULTURE! SO YOU WERE ALWAYS AFTER ME TO GET BOOKS FOR YOU. DON’T THINK YOU WERE KIDDING ME.”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN DID NOT LOOK SURPRISED. HE MUST HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THIS FOR YEARS. HE MUST HAVE IMAGINED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN A HUNDRED TIMES THE DAY THE CORSICAN WOULD SLIP UP BEHIND HIM AND A FURIOUS VOICE WOULD RESOUND SUDDENLY IN HIS EARS. YET HE CAME BACK EVERY EVENING HE FEVERISHLY PURSUED HIS READING AND THEN FROM TIME TO TIME LIKE A THIEF STROKED A WHITE HAND OR PERHAPS THE LEG OF A SMALL BOY. IT WAS RESIGNATION THAT I READ ON HIS FACE.

“I DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN” HE STAMMERED “I’VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS. . . .”

HE FEIGNED INDIGNATION AND SURPRISE BUT WITHOUT CONVICTION. HE KNEW QUITE WELL THAT THE EVENT WAS THERE AND THAT NOTHING COULD HOLD IT BACK ANY LONGER THAT HE HAD TO LIVE THE MINUTES OF IT ONE BY ONE.

“DON’T LISTEN TO HIM” MY NEIGHBOUR SAID “I SAW HIM.” SHE GOT UP HEAVILY: “AND THAT ISN’T THE FIRST TIME I’VE SEEN HIM; NO LATER THAN LAST MONDAY I SAW HIM AND I DIDN’T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE I COULDN’T BELIEVE MY EYES AND I’D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT IN A LIBRARY A SERIOUS PLACE WHERE PEOPLE COME TO LEARN THINGS LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN; THINGS THAT’D MAKE YOU BLUSH. I HAVEN’T ANY CHILDREN BUT I PITY THE MOTHERS WHO SEND THEIR OWN TO WORK HERE THINKING THEY’RE WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND ALL THE TIME THERE ARE MONSTERS WITH NO RESPECT FOR ANYTHING AND WHO KEEP THEM FROM DOING THEIR HOMEWORK.”

THE CORSICAN WENT UP TO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN:

“YOU HEAR WHAT THE LADY SAYS?” HE SHOUTED IN HIS FACE. “YOU DON’T NEED TO TRY AND MAKE FOOLS OF US. WE SAW YOU YOU SWINE!”

“MONSIEUR I ADVISE YOU TO BE POLITE” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAID WITH DIGNITY. IT WAS HIS PART. PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO CONFESS AND RUN BUT HE HAD TO PLAY HIS PART TO THE END. HE WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE CORSICAN HIS EYES WERE ALMOST CLOSED. HIS ARMS HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDES; HE WAS HORRIBLY PALE. AND THEN A FLUSH OF BLOOD ROSE TO HIS FACE.

THE CORSICAN WAS SUFFOCATING WITH FURY:

“POLITE? FILTH! MAYBE YOU THINK I DIDN’T SEE YOU. I WAS WATCHING YOU ALL THE TIME. I’VE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR MONTHS!”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND PRETENDED TO DROP BACK INTO HIS READING. SCARLET HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE HAD TAKEN ON A LOOK OF SUPREME INTEREST AND LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT A REPRODUCTION OF A BYZANTINE MOSAIC.

“HE GOES ON READING. HE’S GOT A NERVE” THE WOMAN SAID LOOKING AT THE CORSICAN.

THE CORSICAN WAS UNDECIDED. AT THE SAME TIME THE ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN A TIMID WELL-MEANING YOUNG MAN WHOM THE CORSICAN TERRORISED SLOWLY RAISED HIMSELF FROM HIS DESK AND CALLED: “PAOLI WHAT’S THE MATTER?” THERE WAS A MOMENT OF IRRESOLUTION AND I HOPED THE AFFAIR WOULD END THERE. BUT THE CORSICAN MUST HAVE THOUGHT AGAIN AND FOUND HIMSELF RIDICULOUS. ANGRY NOT KNOWING WHAT MORE TO SAY TO THIS MUTE VICTIM HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL STATURE AND FLUNG A GREAT FIST INTO THE AIR. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN TURNED AROUND FRIGHTENED. HE LOOKED AT THE CORSICAN OPEN-MOUTHED; THERE WAS A HORRIBLE FEAR IN HIS EYES.

“IF YOU STRIKE ME I SHALL REPORT YOU” HE SAID WITH DIFFICULTY “I SHALL LEAVE OF MY OWN FREE WILL.”

I GOT UP BUT IT WAS TOO LATE: THE CORSICAN GAVE A VOLUPTUOUS LITTLE WHINE AND SUDDENLY CRASHED HIS FIST AGAINST THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S NOSE. FOR A SECOND I COULD ONLY SEE HIS EYES HIS MAGNIFICENT EYES WIDE WITH SHAME AND HORROR ABOVE A SLEEVE AND SWARTHY FIST. WHEN THE CORSICAN DREW BACK HIS FIST THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN’S NOSE BEGAN POURING BLOOD. HE WANTED TO PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS FACE BUT THE CORSICAN STRUCK HIM AGAIN ON THE CORNER OF THE MOUTH. THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARED IN FRONT OF HIM WITH GENTLE TIMID EYES. THE BLOOD RAN FROM HIS NOSE ONTO HIS COAT. HE GROPED AROUND WITH HIS LEFT HAND TRYING TO FIND HIS PACKAGE WHILE WITH HIS RIGHT HE STUBBORNLY TRIED TO WIPE HIS DRIPPING NOSTRILS.

“I’M GOING” HE SAID AS IF TO HIMSELF.

THE WOMAN NEXT TO ME WAS PALE AND HER EYES WERE GLEAMING.

“ROTTER” SHE SAID “SERVES HIM RIGHT.”

I SHOOK WITH RAGE. I WENT ROUND THE TABLE AND GRABBED THE LITTLE CORSICAN BY THE NECK AND LIFTED HIM UP TREMBLING: I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BREAK HIM OVER THE TABLE. HE TURNED BLUE AND STRUGGLED TRYING TO SCRATCH ME; BUT HIS SHORT ARMS DIDN’T REACH MY FACE. I DIDN’T SAY A WORD BUT I WANTED TO SMASH IN HIS NOSE AND DISFIGURE HIM. HE UNDERSTOOD HE RAISED HIS ELBOW TO PROTECT HIS FACE: I WAS GLAD BECAUSE I SAW HE WAS AFRAID. SUDDENLY HE BEGAN TO RATTLE:

“LET GO OF ME YOU BRUTE. ARE YOU A FAIRY TOO?”

I STILL WONDER WHY I LET HIM GO. WAS I AFRAID OF COMPLICATIONS? HAD THESE LAZY YEARS IN BOUVILLE ROTTED ME? BEFORE I WOULDN’T HAVE LET GO OF HIM WITHOUT KNOCKING OUT HIS TEETH. I TURNED TO THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WHO HAD FINALLY GOT UP. BUT HE FLED FROM MY LOOK HEAD BOWED AND WENT TO TAKE HIS COAT FROM THE HANGER. HE PASSED HIS LEFT HAND CONSTANTLY OVER HIS NOSE AS IF TO STOP THE BLEEDING. BUT THE BLOOD WAS STILL FLOWING AND I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD BE SICK. WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANYONE HE MUTTERED:

“I’VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS. . . .”

HARDLY BACK ON HIS FEET THE LITTLE MAN HAD BECOME MASTER OF THE SITUATION AGAIN. . . .

“GET THE HELL OUT” HE TOLD THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN “AND DON’T EVER SET FOOT IN HERE AGAIN OR I’LL HAVE THE POLICE ON YOU.”

I CAUGHT UP WITH THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. I WAS ANNOYED ASHAMED AT HIS SHAME I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM. HE DIDN’T SEEM TO NOTICE I WAS THERE. HE HAD FINALLY TAKEN OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND HE SPAT CONTINUOUSLY INTO IT. HIS NOSE WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE LESS.

“COME TO THE DRUGSTORE WITH ME” I TOLD HIM AWKWARDLY.

HE DIDN’T ANSWER. A LOUD MURMUR ESCAPED FROM THE READING-ROOM.

“I CAN NEVER COME BACK HERE” THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN SAID. HE TURNED AND LOOKED PERPLEXEDLY AT THE STAIRS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE READING-ROOM. THIS MOVEMENT MADE THE BLOOD RUN BETWEEN HIS COLLAR AND HIS NECK. HIS MOUTH AND CHEEKS WERE SMEARED WITH BLOOD.

“COME ON” I SAID TAKING HIM BY THE ARM.

HE SHUDDERED AND PULLED AWAY VIOLENTLY.

“LET ME GO!”

“BUT YOU CAN’T STAY BY YOURSELF SOMEONE HAS TO WASH YOUR FACE AND FIX YOU UP.”

HE REPEATED:

“LET ME GO I BEG YOU SIR LET ME GO.”

HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF HYSTERICS: I LET HIM GO. THE SETTING SUN LIT HIS BENT BACK FOR A MOMENT THEN HE DISAPPEARED. ON THE THRESHOLD THERE WAS A STAR-SHAPED SPLASH OF BLOOD.

ONE HOUR LATER:

IT IS GREY OUTSIDE THE SUN IS SETTING; THE TRAIN LEAVES IN TWO HOURS. I CROSSED THE PARK FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I AM WALKING DOWN THE RUE BOULIBET. I KNOW IT’S THE RUE BOULIBET BUT I DON’T RECOGNIZE IT. USUALLY WHEN I START DOWN IT I SEEM TO CROSS A DEEP LAYER OF GOOD SENSE: SQUAT AND AWKWARD THE RUE BOULIBET WITH ITS TARRED AND UNEVEN SURFACE LOOKED LIKE A NATIONAL HIGHWAY WHEN IT PASSES THROUGH RICH COUNTRY TOWNS WITH SOLID THREE-STOREY HOUSES FOR MORE THAN HALF A MILE; I CALLED IT A COUNTRY ROAD AND IT ENCHANTED ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO OUT OF PLACE SO PARADOXICAL IN A COMMERCIAL PORT. TODAY THE HOUSES ARE THERE BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR RURAL LOOK: THEY ARE BUILDINGS AND NOTHING MORE. I HAD THE SAME FEELING IN THE PARK A LITTLE WHILE AGO: THE PLANTS THE GRASS PLOTS THE OLIVIER MASQUERET FOUNTAIN LOOKED STUBBORN THROUGH BEING INEXPRESSIVE. I UNDERSTAND: THE CITY IS THE FIRST ONE TO ABANDON ME. I HAVE NOT LEFT BOUVILLE AND ALREADY I AM THERE NO LONGER. BOUVILLE IS SILENT. I FIND IT STRANGE THAT I HAVE TO STAY TWO MORE HOURS IN THIS CITY WHICH WITHOUT BOTHERING ABOUT ME ANY MORE HAS STRAIGHTENED UP ITS FURNITURE AND PUT IT UNDER DUST-SHEETS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO UNCOVER IT IN ALL ITS FRESHNESS TO NEW ARRIVALS THIS EVENING OR TOMORROW. I FEEL MORE FORGOTTEN THAN EVER.

I TAKE A FEW STEPS AND STOP. I SAVOUR THIS TOTAL OBLIVION INTO WHICH I HAVE FALLEN. I AM BETWEEN TWO CITIES ONE KNOWS NOTHING OF ME THE OTHER KNOWS ME NO LONGER. WHO REMEMBERS ME? PERHAPS A HEAVY YOUNG WOMAN IN LONDON. . . . AND IS IT REALLY OF ME THAT SHE THINKS? BESIDES THERE IS THAT MAN THAT EGYPTIAN. PERHAPS HE HAS JUST GONE INTO HER ROOM PERHAPS HE HAS TAKEN HER IN HIS ARMS. I AM NOT JEALOUS; I KNOW THAT SHE IS OUTLIVING HERSELF. EVEN IF SHE LOVED HIM WITH ALL HER HEART IT WOULD STILL BE THE LOVE OF A DEAD WOMAN. I HAD HER LAST LIVING LOVE. BUT THERE IS STILL SOMETHING HE CAN GIVE HER: PLEASURE. AND IF SHE IS FAINTING AND SINKING INTO ENJOYMENT THERE IS NOTHING MORE WHICH ATTACHES HER TO ME. SHE TAKES HER PLEASURE AND I AM NO MORE FOR HER THAN IF I HAD NEVER MET HER; SHE HAS SUDDENLY EMPTIED HERSELF OF ME AND ALL OTHER CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE WORLD HAS ALSO EMPTIED ITSELF OF ME. IT SEEMS FUNNY. YET I KNOW THAT I EXIST THAT I AM HERE.

NOW WHEN I SAY “I” IT SEEMS HOLLOW TO ME. I CAN’T MANAGE TO FEEL MYSELF VERY WELL I AM SO FORGOTTEN. THE ONLY REAL THING LEFT IN ME IS EXISTENCE WHICH FEELS IT EXISTS. I YAWN LENGTHILY. NO ONE. ANTOINE ROQUENTIN EXISTS FOR ON ONE. THAT AMUSES ME. AND JUST WHAT IS ANTOINE ROQUENTIN? AN ABSTRACTION. A PALE REFLECTION OF MYSELF WAVERS IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS. ANTOINE ROQUENTIN . . . AND SUDDENLY THE “I” PALES PALES AND FADES OUT.

LUCID FORLORN CONSCIOUSNESS IS WALLED-UP; IT PERPETUATES ITSELF. NOBODY LIVES THERE ANY MORE. A LITTLE WHILE AGO SOMEONE SAID “ME” SAID MY CONSCIOUSNESS. WHO? OUTSIDE THERE WERE STREETS ALIVE WITH KNOWN SMELLS AND COLOURS. NOW NOTHING IS LEFT BUT ANONYMOUS WALLS ANONYMOUS CONSCIOUSNESS. THAT IS WHAT THERE IS: WALLS AND BETWEEN THE WALLS A SMALL TRANSPARENCY ALIVE AND IMPERSONAL. CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS AS A TREE AS A BLADE OF GRASS. IT SLUMBERS IT GROWS BORED. SMALL FUGITIVE PRESENCES POPULATE IT LIKE BIRDS IN THE BRANCHES. POPULATE IT AND DISAPPEAR. CONSCIOUSNESS FORGOTTEN FORSAKEN BETWEEN THESE WALLS UNDER THIS GREY SKY. AND HERE IS THE SENSE OF ITS EXISTENCE: IT IS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUPERFLUOUS. IT DILUTES SCATTERS ITSELF TRIES TO LOSE ITSELF ON THE BROWN WALL ALONG THE LAMP POST OR DOWN THERE IN THE EVENING MIST. BUT IT NEVER FORGETS ITSELF. THAT IS ITS LOT. THERE IS A STIFLED VOICE WHICH TELLS IT: “THE TRAIN LEAVES IN TWO HOURS” AND THERE IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS VOICE. THERE IS ALSO CONSCIOUSNESS OF A FACE. IT PASSES SLOWLY FULL OF BLOOD SPATTERED AND ITS BULGING EYES WEEP. IT IS NOT BETWEEN THE WALLS IT IS NOWHERE. IT VANISHES; A BENT BODY WITH A BLEEDING FACE REPLACES IT WALKS SLOWLY AWAY SEEMS TO STOP AT EACH STEP NEVER STOPS. THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS BODY WALKING SLOWLY IN A DARK STREET. IT WALKS BUT IT GETS NO FURTHER AWAY. THE DARK STREET DOES NOT END IT LOSES ITSELF IN NOTHINGNESS. IT IS NOT BETWEEN THE WALLS IT IS NOWHERE. AND THERE IS CONSCIOUSNESS OF A STIFLED VOICE WHICH SAYS: “THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN IS WANDERING THROUGH THE CITY.”

NOT THE SAME CITY NOT BETWEEN THESE TONELESS WALLS THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN WALKS IN A CITY WHERE HE IS NOT FORGOTTEN. PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT HIM; THE CORSICAN THE FAT WOMAN; PERHAPS EVERYBODY IN THE CITY. HE HAS NOT YET LOST HE CANNOT LOSE HIMSELF THIS TORTURED BLEEDING SELF THEY DIDN’T WANT TO KILL. HIS LIPS AND NOSTRILS HURT HIM; HE THINKS: “IT HURTS.” HE WALKS HE MUST WALK. IF HE STOPPED FOR ONE INSTANT THE HIGH WALLS OF THE LIBRARY WOULD SUDDENLY RISE UP AROUND HIM AND LOCK HIM IN; THE CORSICAN WOULD SPRING FROM ONE SIDE AND THE SCENE WOULD BEGIN AGAIN EXACTLY ALIKE IN ALL THE DETAILS AND THE WOMAN WOULD SMIRK: “THEY OUGHT TO BE IN JAIL THOSE ROTTERS.” AND THE SCENE WOULD BEGIN AGAIN. HE THINKS: “MY GOD IF ONLY I HADN’T DONE THAT IF ONLY THAT COULD NOT BE TRUE.”

THE TROUBLED FACE PASSES BACK AND FORTH THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS: “MAYBE HE IS GOING TO KILL HIMSELF.” NO: THIS GENTLE BAITED SOUL COULD NEVER DREAM OF DEATH.

THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS. IT SEES THROUGH ITSELF PEACEFUL AND EMPTY BETWEEN THE WALLS FREED FROM THE MAN WHO INHABITED IT MONSTROUS BECAUSE EMPTY. THE VOICE SAYS: “THE LUGGAGE IS REGISTERED. THE TRAIN LEAVES IN TWO HOURS.” THE WALLS SLIDE RIGHT AND LEFT. THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF MACADAM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE IRONMONGERS THE LOOPHOLES OF THE BARRACKS AND THE VOICE SAYS: “FOR THE LAST TIME.”

CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANNY OF ANNY FAT OLD ANNY IN HER HOTEL ROOM CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUFFERING AND THE SUFFERING IS CONSCIOUS BETWEEN THE LONG WALLS WHICH LEAVE AND WILL NEVER RETURN: “WILL THERE NEVER BE AN END TO IT?” THE VOICE SINGS A JAZZ TUNE BETWEEN THE WALLS “SOME OF THESE DAYS” WILL THERE NEVER BE AN END TO IT? AND THE TUNE COMES BACK SOFTLY INSIDIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TO TAKE BACK THE VOICE AND THE VOICE SINGS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO STOP AND THE BODY WALKS AND THERE IS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. BUT NO ONE IS THERE TO SUFFER AND WRING HIS HANDS AND TAKE PITY ON HIMSELF. NO ONE IT IS A SUFFERING OF THE CROSSROADS A FORGOTTEN SUFFERING—WHICH CANNOT FORGET ITSELF. AND THE VOICE SAYS: “THERE IS THE ‘RAILWAYMEN’S RENDEZVOUS’” AND THE I SURGES INTO THE CONSCIOUSNESS IT IS I ANTOINE ROQUENTIN I’M LEAVING FOR PARIS SHORTLY; I AM GOING TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE PATRONNE.

‘I’M COMING TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU.”

“YOU’RE LEAVING MONSIEUR ROQUENTIN?”

“I’M GOING TO PARIS. I NEED A CHANGE.”

“LUCKY!”

HOW WAS I ABLE TO PRESS MY LIPS AGAINST THIS LARGE FACE? HER BODY NO LONGER BELONGS TO ME. YESTERDAY I WAS ABLE TO IMAGINE IT UNDER THE BLACK WOOL DRESS. TODAY THE DRESS IS IMPENETRABLE. THIS WHITE BODY WITH VEINS ON THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN WAS IT A DREAM?

“WE’LL MISS YOU” THE PATRONNE SAYS. “WON’T YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK? IT’S ON THE HOUSE.”

WE SIT DOWN TOUCH GLASSES. SHE LOWERS HER VOICE A LITTLE.

“I WAS USED TO YOU” SHE SAYS WITH POLITE REGRET” WE GOT ALONG TOGETHER.”

“I’LL BE BACK TO SEE YOU.”

“BE SURE TO MONSIEUR ANTOINE. STOP IN AND SAY HELLO TO US THE NEXT TIME YOU’RE IN BOUVILLE. YOU JUST TELL YOURSELF: ‘I’M GOING TO SAY HELLO TO MME JEANNE SHE’LL LIKE THAT.’ THAT’S TRUE A PERSON REALLY LIKES TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO OTHERS. BESIDES PEOPLE ALWAYS COME BACK HERE TO SEE US. WE HAVE SAILORS DON’T WE WORKING FOR THE TRANSAT: SOMETIMES I GO FOR TWO YEARS WITHOUT SEEING THEM THEY’RE EITHER IN BRAZIL OR NEW YORK OR ELSE WORKING ON A TRANSPORT IN BORDEAUX. AND THEN ONE FINE DAY I SEE THEM AGAIN. ‘HELLO MADAME JEANNE.’ AND WE HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER. YOU CAN BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT I REMEMBER WHAT EACH ONE LIKES. FROM TWO YEARS BACK! I TELL MADELEINE: GIVE A DRY VERMOUTH TO M. PIERRE A NOILLY CINZANO TO M. LÉON. THEY ASK ME: HOW CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT? IT’S MY BUSINESS I TELL THEM.”

IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM THERE IS A THICK-SET MAN WHO HAS BEEN SLEEPING WITH HER RECENTLY. HE CALLS HER:

“PATRONNE!”

SHE GETS UP:

“EXCUSE ME MONSIEUR ANTOINE.”

THE WAITRESS COMES OVER TO ME:

“SO YOU’RE LEAVING US JUST LIKE THAT?”

“I’M GOING TO PARIS.”

“I LIVED IN PARIS” SHE SAYS PROUDLY. “FOR TWO YEARS. I WORKED IN SIMÉON’S. BUT I WAS HOMESICK.”

SHE HESITATES A SECOND THEN REALIZES SHE HAS NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO ME:

“WELL GOOD-BYE MONSIEUR ANTOINE.”

SHE WIPES HER HAND ON HER APRON AND HOLDS IT OUT TO ME.

“GOOD-BYE MADELEINE.”

SHE LEAVES. I PULL THE JOURNAL DE BOUVILLE OVER TO ME THEN PUSH IT AWAY AGAIN: I READ IT IN THE LIBRARY A LITTLE WHILE AGO FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

THE PATRONNE DOES NOT COME BACK: SHE ABANDONS HER FAT HANDS TO HER BOY FRIEND WHO KNEADS THEM WITH PASSION.

THE TRAIN LEAVES IN THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR.

I COUNT MY MONEY TO PASS THE TIME.

TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS A MONTH ISN’T ENORMOUS. BUT IF I HOLD MYSELF BACK A LITTLE IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. A ROOM FOR 300 FRANCS 15 FRANCS A DAY FOR FOOD: THAT LEAVES 450 FRANCS FOR PETTY CASH LAUNDRY AND MOVIES. I WON’T NEED UNDERWEAR OR CLOTHES FOR A LONG WHILE. BOTH MY SUITS ARE CLEAN EVEN THOUGH THEY SHINE AT THE ELBOWS A LITTLE: THEY’LL LAST ME THREE OR FOUR YEARS IF I TAKE CARE OF THEM.

GOOD GOD! IS IT I WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THIS MUSHROOM EXISTENCE? WHAT WILL I DO ALL DAY LONG? I’LL TAKE WALKS. I’LL SIT ON A FOLDING CHAIR IN THE TUILERIES—OR RATHER ON A BENCH OUT OF ECONOMY. I’LL READ IN THE LIBRARIES. AND THEN WHAT? A MOVIE ONCE A WEEK. AND THEN WHAT? CAN I SMOKE A VOLTIGEUR ON SUNDAY? SHALL I PLAY CROQUET WITH THE RETIRED OLD MEN IN THE LUXEMBOURG? THIRTY YEARS OLD! I PITY MYSELF. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WONDER IF IT WOULDN’T BE BETTER TO SPEND ALL MY 300000 FRANCS IN ONE YEAR—AND AFTER THAT . . . BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO ME? NEW CLOTHES? WOMEN? TRAVEL? I’VE HAD ALL THAT AND NOW IT’S OVER I DON’T FEEL LIKE IT ANY MORE: FOR WHAT I’D GET OUT OF IT! A YEAR FROM NOW I’D FIND MYSELF AS EMPTY AS I AM TODAY WITHOUT EVEN A MEMORY AND A COWARD FACING DEATH.

THIRTY YEARS! AND 14400 FRANCS IN THE BANK. COUPONS TO CASH EVERY MONTH. YET I’M NOT AN OLD MAN! LET THEM GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO NO MATTER WHAT . . . I’D BETTER THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE I’M PLAYING A COMEDY NOW. I KNOW VERY WELL THAT I DON’T WANT TO DO ANYTHING: TO DO SOMETHING IS TO CREATE EXISTENCE—AND THERE’S QUITE ENOUGH EXISTENCE AS IT IS.

THE TRUTH IS THAT I CAN’T PUT DOWN MY PEN: I THINK I’M GOING TO HAVE THE NAUSEA AND I FEEL AS THOUGH I’M DELAYING IT WHILE WRITING. SO I WRITE WHATEVER COMES INTO MY MIND.

MADELEINE WHO WANTS TO PLEASE ME CALLS TO ME FROM THE DISTANCE HOLDING UP A RECORD:

“YOUR RECORD MONSIEUR ANTOINE THE ONE YOU LIKE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT FOR THE LAST TIME?”

“PLEASE.”

I SAID THAT OUT OF POLITENESS BUT I DON’T FEEL TOO WELL DISPOSED TO LISTEN TO JAZZ. STILL I’M GOING TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE AS MADELEINE SAYS I’M HEARING IT FOR THE LAST TIME: IT IS VERY OLD EVEN TOO OLD FOR THE PROVINCES; I WILL LOOK FOR IT IN VAIN IN PARIS. MADELEINE GOES AND SETS IT ON THE GRAMOPHONE IT IS GOING TO SPIN; IN THE GROOVES THE STEEL NEEDLE IS GOING TO START JUMPING AND GRINDING AND WHEN THE GROOVES WILL HAVE SPIRALLED IT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE DISC IT WILL BE FINISHED AND THE HOARSE VOICE SINGING “SOME OF THESE DAYS” WILL BE SILENT FOREVER.

IT BEGINS.

TO THINK THAT THERE ARE IDIOTS WHO GET CONSOLATION FROM THE FINE ARTS. LIKE MY AUNT BIGEOIS: “CHOPIN’S PRELUDES WERE SUCH A HELP TO ME WHEN YOUR POOR UNCLE DIED.” AND THE CONCERT HALLS OVERFLOW WITH HUMILIATED OUTRAGED PEOPLE WHO CLOSE THEIR EYES AND TRY TO TURN THEIR PALE FACES INTO RECEIVING ANTENNÆ. THEY IMAGINE THAT THE SOUNDS FLOW INTO THEM SWEET NOURISHING AND THAT THEIR SUFFERINGS BECOME MUSIC LIKE WERTHER; THEY THINK THAT BEAUTY IS COMPASSIONATE TO THEM. MUGS.

I’D LIKE THEM TO TELL ME WHETHER THEY FIND THIS MUSIC COMPASSIONATE. A WHILE AGO I WAS CERTAINLY FAR FROM SWIMMING IN BEATITUDES. ON THE SURFACE I WAS COUNTING MY MONEY MECHANICALLY. UNDERNEATH STAGNATED ALL THOSE UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS WHICH TOOK THE FORM OF UNFORMULATED QUESTIONS MUTE ASTONISHMENTS AND WHICH LEAVE ME NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT. THOUGHTS OF ANNY OF MY WASTED LIFE. AND THEN STILL FURTHER DOWN NAUSEA TIMID AS DAWN. BUT THERE WAS NO MUSIC THEN I WAS MOROSE AND CALM. ALL THE THINGS AROUND ME WERE MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS I A SORT OF MESSY SUFFERING. THE WORLD WAS SO UGLY OUTSIDE OF ME THESE DIRTY GLASSES ON THE TABLE WERE SO UGLY AND THE BROWN STAINS ON THE MIRROR AND MADELEINE’S APRON AND THE FRIENDLY LOOK OF THE GROSS LOVER OF THE PATRONNE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORLD SO UGLY THAT I FELT COMFORTABLE AT HOME.

NOW THERE IS THIS SONG ON THE SAXOPHONE. AND I AM ASHAMED. A GLORIOUS LITTLE SUFFERING HAS JUST BEEN BORN AN EXEMPLARY SUFFERING. FOUR NOTES ON THE SAXOPHONE. THEY COME AND GO THEY SEEM TO SAY: YOU MUST BE LIKE US SUFFER IN RHYTHM. ALL RIGHT! NATURALLY I’D LIKE TO SUFFER THAT WAY IN RHYTHM WITHOUT COMPLACENCE WITHOUT SELF-PITY WITH AN ARID PURITY. BUT IS IT MY FAULT IF THE BEER AT THE BOTTOM OF MY GLASS IS WARM IF THERE ARE BROWN STAINS ON THE MIRROR IF I AM NOT WANTED IF THE SINCEREST OF MY SUFFERINGS DRAGS AND WEIGHS WITH TOO MUCH FLESH AND THE SKIN TOO WIDE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE A SEA-ELEPHANT WITH BULGING EYES DAMP AND TOUCHING AND YET SO UGLY? NO THEY CERTAINLY CAN’T TELL ME IT’S COMPASSIONATE—THIS LITTLE JEWELLED PAIN WHICH SPINS AROUND ABOVE THE RECORD AND DAZZLES ME. NOT EVEN IRONIC: IT SPINS GAILY COMPLETELY SELF-ABSORBED; LIKE A SCYTHE IT HAS CUT THROUGH THE DRAB INTIMACY OF THE WORLD AND NOW IT SPINS AND ALL OF US MADELEINE THE THICK-SET MAN THE PATRONNE MYSELF THE TABLES BENCHES THE STAINED MIRROR THE GLASSES ALL OF US ABANDON OURSELVES TO EXISTENCE BECAUSE WE WERE AMONG OURSELVES ONLY AMONG OURSELVES IT HAS TAKEN US UNAWARES IN THE DISORDER THE DAY TO DAY DRIFT: I AM ASHAMED FOR MYSELF AND FOR WHAT EXISTS IN FRONT OF IT.

IT DOES NOT EXIST. IT IS EVEN AN ANNOYANCE; IF I WERE TO GET UP AND RIP THIS RECORD FROM THE TABLE WHICH HOLDS IT IF I WERE TO BREAK IT IN TWO I WOULDN’T REACH IT. IT IS BEYOND—ALWAYS BEYOND SOMETHING A VOICE A VIOLIN NOTE. THROUGH LAYERS AND LAYERS OF EXISTENCE IT VEILS ITSELF THIN AND FIRM AND WHEN YOU WANT TO SEIZE IT YOU FIND ONLY EXISTANTS YOU BUTT AGAINST EXISTANTS DEVOID OF SENSE. IT IS BEHIND THEM: I DON’T EVEN HEAR IT I HEAR SOUNDS VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR WHICH UNVEIL IT. IT DOES NOT EXIST BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING SUPERFLUOUS: IT IS ALL THE REST WHICH IN RELATION TO IT IS SUPERFLUOUS. IT IS.

AND I TOO WANTED TO BE. THAT IS ALL I WANTED; THIS IS THE LAST WORD. AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THESE ATTEMPTS WHICH SEEMED WITHOUT BONDS I FIND THE SAME DESIRE AGAIN: TO DRIVE EXISTENCE OUT OF ME TO RID THE PASSING MOMENTS OF THEIR FAT TO TWIST THEM DRY THEM PURIFY MYSELF HARDEN MYSELF TO GIVE BACK AT LAST THE SHARP PRECISE SOUND OF A SAXOPHONE NOTE. THAT COULD EVEN MAKE AN APOLOGUE: THERE WAS A POOR MAN WHO GOT IN THE WRONG WORLD. HE EXISTED LIKE OTHER PEOPLE IN A WORLD OF PUBLIC PARKS BISTROS COMMERCIAL CITIES AND HE WANTED TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE BEHIND THE CANVAS OF PAINTINGS WITH THE DOGES OF TINTORETTO WITH GOZZOLI’S FLORENTINES BEHIND THE PAGES OF BOOKS WITH FABRIZIO DEL DONGO AND JULIEN SOREL BEHIND THE PHONOGRAPH RECORDS WITH THE LONG DRY LAMENTS OF JAZZ. AND THEN AFTER MAKING A COMPLETE FOOL OF HIMSELF HE UNDERSTOOD HE OPENED HIS EYES HE SAW THAT IT WAS A MISDEAL: HE WAS IN A BISTRO JUST IN FRONT OF A GLASS OF WARM BEER. HE STAYED OVERWHELMED ON THE BENCH; HE THOUGHT: I AM A FOOL. AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EXISTENCE IN THIS OTHER WORLD WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE DISTANCE BUT WITHOUT EVER APPROACHING IT A LITTLE MELODY BEGAN TO SING AND DANCE: “YOU MUST BE LIKE ME; YOU MUST SUFFER IN RHYTHM.”

THE VOICE SINGS:

SOME OF THESE DAYS

YOU’LL MISS ME HONEY

SOMEONE MUST HAVE SCRATCHED THE RECORD AT THAT SPOT BECAUSE IT MAKES AN ODD NOISE. AND THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CLUTCHES THE HEART: THE MELODY IS ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHED BY THIS TINY COUGHING OF THE NEEDLE ON THE RECORD. IT IS SO FAR—SO FAR BEHIND. I UNDERSTAND THAT TOO: THE DISC IS SCRATCHED AND IS WEARING OUT PERHAPS THE SINGER IS DEAD; I’M GOING TO LEAVE I’M GOING TO TAKE MY TRAIN. BUT BEHIND THE EXISTENCE WHICH FALLS FROM ONE PRESENT TO THE OTHER WITHOUT A PAST WITHOUT A FUTURE BEHIND THESE SOUNDS WHICH DECOMPOSE FROM DAY TO DAY PEEL OFF AND SLIP TOWARDS DEATH THE MELODY STAYS THE SAME YOUNG AND FIRM LIKE A PITILESS WITNESS.

THE VOICE IS SILENT. THE DISC SCRAPES A LITTLE THEN STOPS. DELIVERED FROM A TROUBLESOME DREAM THE CAFÉ RUMINATES CHEWS THE CUD OVER THE PLEASURE OF EXISTING. THE PATRONNE’S FACE IS FLUSHED SHE SLAPS THE FAT WHITE CHEEKS OF HER NEW FRIEND BUT WITHOUT SUCCEEDING IN COLOURING THEM. CHEEKS OF A CORPSE. I STAGNATE FALL HALF-ASLEEP. IN FIFTEEN MINUTES I WILL BE ON THE TRAIN BUT I DON’T THINK ABOUT IT. I THINK ABOUT A CLEAN-SHAVEN AMERICAN WITH THICK BLACK EYEBROWS SUFFOCATING WITH THE HEAT ON THE TWENTY-FIRST FLOOR OF A NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER. THE SKY BURNS ABOVE NEW YORK THE BLUE OF THE SKY IS INFLAMED ENORMOUS YELLOW FLAMES COME AND LICK THE ROOFS; THE BROOKLYN CHILDREN ARE GOING TO PUT ON BATHING DRAWERS AND PLAY UNDER THE WATER OF A FIRE-HOSE. THE DARK ROOM ON THE TWENTY-FIRST FLOOR COOKS UNDER A HIGH PRESSURE. THE AMERICAN WITH THE BLACK EYEBROWS SIGHS GASPS AND THE SWEAT ROLLS DOWN HIS CHEEKS. HE IS SITTING IN SHIRTSLEEVES IN FRONT OF HIS PIANO; HE HAS A TASTE OF SMOKE IN HIS MOUTH AND VAGUELY A GHOST OF A TUNE IN HIS HEAD. “SOME OF THESE DAYS.” TOM WILL COME IN AN HOUR WITH HIS HIP-FLASK; THEN BOTH OF THEM WILL LOWER THEMSELVES INTO LEATHER ARMCHAIRS AND DRINK BRIMMING GLASSES OF WHISKY AND THE FIRE OF THE SKY WILL COME AND INFLAME THEIR THROATS THEY WILL FEEL THE WEIGHT OF AN IMMENSE TORRID SLUMBER. BUT FIRST THE TUNE MUST BE WRITTEN DOWN. “SOME OF THESE DAYS.” THE MOIST HAND SEIZES THE PENCIL ON THE PIANO. “SOME OF THESE DAYS YOU’LL MISS ME HONEY.”

THAT’S THE WAY IT HAPPENED. THAT WAY OR ANOTHER WAY IT MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE. THAT IS HOW IT WAS BORN. IT IS THE WORN-OUT BODY OF THIS JEW WITH BLACK EYEBROWS WHICH IT CHOSE TO CREATE IT. HE HELD THE PENCIL LIMPLY AND THE DROPS OF SWEAT FELL FROM HIS RINGED FINGERS ON TO THE PAPER. AND WHY NOT I? WHY SHOULD IT NEED PRECISELY THIS FAT FOOL FULL OF STALE BEER AND WHISKY FOR THE MIRACLE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED?

“MADELEINE WOULD YOU PUT THE RECORD BACK? JUST ONCE BEFORE I LEAVE.”

MADELEINE STARTS TO LAUGH. SHE TURNS THE CRANK AND IT BEGINS AGAIN. BUT I NO LONGER THINK OF MYSELF. I THINK OF THE MAN OUT THERE WHO WROTE THIS TUNE ONE DAY IN JULY IN THE BLACK HEAT OF HIS ROOM. I TRY TO THINK OF HIM THROUGH THE MELODY THROUGH THE WHITE ACIDULATED SOUNDS OF THE SAXOPHONE. HE MADE IT. HE HAD TROUBLES EVERYTHING DIDN’T WORK OUT FOR HIM THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE: BILLS TO PAY—AND THEN THERE SURELY MUST HAVE BEEN A WOMAN SOMEWHERE WHO WASN’T THINKING ABOUT HIM THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO—AND THEN THERE WAS THIS TERRIBLE HEAT WAVE WHICH TURNED MEN INTO POOLS OF MELTING FAT. THERE IS NOTHING PRETTY OR GLORIOUS IN ALL THAT. BUT WHEN I HEAR THE SOUND AND I THINK THAT THAT MAN MADE IT I FIND THIS SUFFERING AND SWEAT . . . MOVING. HE WAS LUCKY. HE COULDN’T HAVE REALIZED IT. HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT: WITH A LITTLE LUCK THIS THING WILL BRING IN FIFTY DOLLARS. WELL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS THAT A MAN HAS SEEMED MOVING TO ME. I’D LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. IT WOULD INTEREST ME TO FIND OUT THE TYPE OF TROUBLES HE HAD IF HE HAD A WOMAN OR IF HE LIVED ALONE. NOT AT ALL OUT OF HUMANITY; ON THE CONTRARY—BESIDES HE MAY BE DEAD. JUST TO GET A LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIM AND BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT HIM FROM TIME TO TIME LISTENING TO THE RECORD. I DON’T SUPPOSE IT WOULD MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE TO HIM IF HE WERE TOLD THAT IN THE SEVENTH LARGEST CITY OF FRANCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A STATION SOMEONE IS THINKING ABOUT HIM. BUT I’D BE HAPPY IF I WERE IN HIS PLACE; I ENVY HIM. I HAVE TO GO. I GET UP BUT I HESITATE AN INSTANT I’D LIKE TO HEAR THE NEGRESS SING. FOR THE LAST TIME.

SHE SINGS. SO TWO OF THEM ARE SAVED: THE JEW AND THE NEGRESS. SAVED. MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE LOST IRREVOCABLY DROWNED IN EXISTENCE. YET NO ONE COULD THINK OF ME AS I THINK OF THEM WITH SUCH GENTLENESS. NO ONE NOT EVEN ANNY. THEY ARE A LITTLE LIKE DEAD PEOPLE FOR ME A LITTLE LIKE THE HEROES OF A NOVEL; THEY HAVE WASHED THEMSELVES OF THE SIN OF EXISTING. NOT COMPLETELY OF COURSE BUT AS MUCH AS ANY MAN CAN. THIS IDEA SUDDENLY KNOCKS ME OVER BECAUSE I WAS NOT EVEN HOPING FOR THAT ANY MORE. I FEEL SOMETHING BRUSH AGAINST ME LIGHTLY AND I DARE NOT MOVE BECAUSE I AM AFRAID IT WILL GO AWAY. SOMETHING I DIDN’T KNOW ANY MORE: A SORT OF JOY.

THE NEGRESS SINGS. CAN YOU JUSTIFY YOUR EXISTENCE THEN? JUST A LITTLE? I FEEL EXTRAORDINARILY INTIMIDATED. IT ISN’T BECAUSE I HAVE MUCH HOPE. BUT I AM LIKE A MAN COMPLETELY FROZEN AFTER A TREK THROUGH THE SNOW AND WHO SUDDENLY COMES INTO A WARM ROOM. I THINK HE WOULD STAY MOTIONLESS NEAR THE DOOR STILL COLD AND THAT SLOW SHUDDERS WOULD GO RIGHT THROUGH HIM.

SOME OF THESE DAYS

YOU’LL MISS ME HONEY

COULDN’T I TRY. . . . NATURALLY IT WOULDN’T BE A QUESTION OF A TUNE . . . BUT COULDN’T I IN ANOTHER MEDIUM? . . . IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A BOOK: I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. BUT NOT A HISTORY BOOK: HISTORY TALKS ABOUT WHAT HAS EXISTED—AN EXISTANT CAN NEVER JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER EXISTANT. MY ERROR I WANTED TO RESUSCITATE THE MARQUIS DE ROLLEBON. ANOTHER TYPE OF BOOK. I DON’T QUITE KNOW WHICH KIND—BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO GUESS BEHIND THE PRINTED WORDS BEHIND THE PAGES AT SOMETHING WHICH WOULD NOT EXIST WHICH WOULD BE ABOVE EXISTENCE. A STORY FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN AN ADVENTURE. IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND HARD AS STEEL AND MAKE PEOPLE ASHAMED OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

I MUST LEAVE I AM VACILLATING. I DARE NOT MAKE A DECISION. IF I WERE SURE I HAD TALENT. . . . BUT I HAVE NEVER—NEVER WRITTEN ANYTHING OF THAT SORT. HISTORICAL ARTICLES YES—LOTS OF THEM. A BOOK. A NOVEL. AND THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD READ THIS BOOK AND SAY: “ANTOINE ROQUENTIN WROTE IT A RED-HEADED MAN WHO HUNG AROUND CAFÉS” AND THEY WOULD THINK ABOUT MY LIFE AS I THINK ABOUT THE NEGRESS’S: AS SOMETHING PRECIOUS AND ALMOST LEGENDARY. A BOOK NATURALLY AT FIRST IT WOULD ONLY BE A TROUBLESOME TIRING WORK IT WOULDN’T STOP ME FROM EXISTING OR FEELING THAT I EXIST. BUT A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE BOOK WOULD BE WRITTEN WHEN IT WOULD BE BEHIND ME AND I THINK THAT A LITTLE OF ITS CLARITY MIGHT FALL OVER MY PAST. THEN PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT I COULD REMEMBER MY LIFE WITHOUT REPUGNANCE. PERHAPS ONE DAY THINKING PRECISELY OF THIS HOUR OF THIS GLOOMY HOUR IN WHICH I WAIT STOOPING FOR IT TO BE TIME TO GET ON THE TRAIN PERHAPS I SHALL FEEL MY HEART BEAT FASTER AND SAY TO MYSELF: “THAT WAS THE DAY THAT WAS THE HOUR WHEN IT ALL STARTED.” AND I MIGHT SUCCEED—IN THE PAST NOTHING BUT THE PAST—IN ACCEPTING MYSELF.

NIGHT FALLS. ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOTEL PRINTANIA TWO WINDOWS HAVE JUST LIGHTED UP. THE BUILDING-YARD OF THE NEW STATION SMELLS STRONGLY OF DAMP WOOD: TOMORROW IT WILL RAIN IN BOUVILLE.

GARCIN (ENTERS ACCOMPANIED BY THE VALET AND GLANCES AROUND HIM): SO HERE WE ARE?

VALET: YES MR. GARCIN.

GARCIN: AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?

VALET: YES.

GARCIN: SECOND EMPIRE FURNATURE I OBSERVE... WELL WELL I DARE SAY ONE GETS USED TO IT IN TIME.

VALET: SOME DO SOME DON'T.

GARCIN: ALL THE ROOMS ARE LIKE THIS ONE?

VALET: HOW COULD THEY BE? WE CATER FOR ALL SORTS: CHINAMEN AND INDIANS FOR INSTANCE. WHAT USE WOULD THEY HAVE FOR A SECOND EMPIRE CHAIR?

GARCIN: AND WHAT USE DO YOU SUPPOSE I HAVE FOR ONE? DO YOU KNOW WHO I WAS? ... OH WELL IT'S NO GREAT MATTER. AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAD QUITE A HABIT OF LIVING AMONG FURNITURE THAT I DIDN'T RELISH AND IN FALSE POSITIONS. I'D EVEN COME TO LIKE IT. A FALSE POSITION IN A LOUIS-PHILIPPE DINING ROOM -- YOU KNOW THE STYLE? -- WELL THAT HAD ITS POINTS YOU KNOW. BOGUS IN BOGUS SO TO SPEAK.

VALET: AND YOU'LL FIND THAT LIVING IN A SECOND EMPIRE DRAWING-ROOM HAS ITS POINTS.

GARCIN: REALLY? ... YES YES I DARE SAY... STILL I CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT -- THIS!! YOUY KNOW WHAT THEY TELL US DOWN THERE?

VALET: ABOUT WHAT?

GARCIN: ABOUT...THIS- ER~RESIDENCE.

VALET: REALLY SIR HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE SUCH COCK-AND-BULL STORIES? TOLD BY PEOPLE WHO'D NEVER SET FOOT HERE. FOR OF COURSE IF THEY HAD—

GARCIN: QUITE SO. BUT I SAY WHERE ARE THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE?

VALET: THE WHAT?

GARCIN: THE RACKS AND RED-HOT PINCERS AND ALL THE OTHER PARAPHERNALIA?

THINK ABOUT THE PLACE YOU HAVE CHOSEN AS YOUR HELL. DOES IT LOOK ORDINARY AND BOURGEOIS LIKE SARTRE'S DRAWING ROOM OR IS IT EQUIPPED WITH LITERAL INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE LIKE DANTE'S INFERNO? CAN THE MIND BE IN HELL IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE? IS THERE A WAY TO FIND PEACE IN A HELLISH PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT? ENTER SARTRE'S SPACE MORE FULLY AND IMAGINE HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO LIVE THERE ENDLESSLY NIGHT AND DAY:

VALET: AH YOU MUST HAVE YOUR LITTLE JOKE SIR.

GARCIN: MY LITTLE JOKE? OH I SEE. NO I WASN'T JOKING. NO MIRRORS I NOTICE. NO WINDOWS. ONLY TO BE EXPECTED. AND NOTHING BREAKABLE. BUT DAMN IT ALL THEY MIGHT HAVE LEFT ME MY TOOTHBRUSH!

VALET: THAT'S GOOD! SO YOU HAVEN'T YET GOT OVER YOUR—WHAT-DO-YOU-CALL-IT?—SENSE OF HUMAN DIGNITY? EXCUSE MY SMILING.

GARCIN: I'LL ASK YOU TO BE MORE POLITE. I QUITE REALIZE THE POSITION I'M IN BUT I WON'T TOLERATE...

VALET: SORRY SIR. NO OFFENSE MEANT. BUT ALL OUR GUESTS ASKE ME THE SAME QUESTIONS. SILLY QUESTIONS IF YOU'LL PARDON MY SAYING SO. WHERE'S THE TORTURE-CHAMBER? THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY ASK ALL OF THEM. THEY DON'T BOTHER THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE BATHROOM REQUISITES THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU. BUT AFTER A BIT WHEN THEY'VE GOT THEIR NERVE BACK THEY START IN ABOUT THEIR TOOTHBRUSHES AND WHAT-OT. GOOD HEAVENS MR. GARCIN CAN'T YOU USE YOUR BRAINS? WHAT I ASK YOU WOULD BE THE POINT OF BRUSHING YOUR TEETH?

GARCIN: YES OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT. AND WHY SHOUILD ONE WANT TO SEE ONESELF IN A LOOKING- GLASS? BUT THAT BRONZE CONTRAPTION ON THE MANTELPIECE THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. I SUPPOSE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN I STARE MY EYES OUT AT IT. STARE MY EYES OUT—SEE WHAT I MEAN?...ALL RIGHT LET'S PUT OUR CARDS ON THE TABLE. I ASSURE YOU I'M QUITE CONSCIOUS OF MY POSITION. SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT IT FEELS LIKE? A MAN'S DROWNING CHOKING SINKING BY INCHES TILL ONLY HIS EYES ARE JUST ABOVE WATER. AND WHAT DOES HE SEE? A BRONZE ATROCITY BY— WHAT'S THE FELLOW'S NAME?—BARBEDIENNE. A COLLECTOR'S PIECE. AS IN A NIGHTMARE. THAT'S THEIR IDEA ISN'T IT?...NO I SUPPOSE YOU'RE UNDER ORDERS NOT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS; AND I WON'T INSIST. BUT DON'T FORGET MY MAN I'VE A GOOD NOTION OF WHAT'S COMING TO ME SO

DON'T YOU BOAST YOU'VE CAUGHT ME OFF MY GUARD. I'M FACING THE SITUATION FACING IT. SO THAT'S THAT; NO TOOTHBRUSH. AND NO BED EITHER. ONE NEVER SLEEPS I TAKE IT?

VALET: THAT'S SO.

GARCIN: JUST AS I EXPECTED. WHY SHOULD ONE SLEEP? A SORT OF DROWSINESS STEALS ON YOU TICKLES YOU BEHIND THE EARS AND YOU FEEL YOUR EYES CLOSING— BUT WHY SLEEP? YOU LIE DOWN ON THE SOFA AND— IN A FLASH SLEEP FLIES AWAY. MILES AND MILES AWAY. SO YOU RUB YOUR EYES GET UP AND IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.

VALET: ROMANTIC THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

GARCIN: WILL YOU KEEP QUIET PLEASE! ...I WON'T MAKE A SCENE I SHAN'T BE SORRY FOR MYSELF I'LL FACE THE SITUATION AS I SAID JUST NOW. FACE IT FAIRLY AND SQUARELY. I SON'T HAVE IT SPRINGING AT ME FROM BEHIND BEFORE I'VE TIME TO SIZE IT UP. AND YOU CALL THAT BEING "ROMANTIC!" SO IT COMES TO THIS; ONE DOESN'T NEED REST. WHY BOTHER ABOUT SLEEP IF ONE ISN'T SLEEPY? THAT STANDS TO REASON DOESN'T IT? WAIT A MINUTE THERE'S A SNAG SOMEWHERE; SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE. WHY NOW SHOULD IT BE DISAGREEABLE? ...AH I SEE; IT'S LIFE WITHOUT A BREAK.

COULD HELL BE DESCRIBED AS TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING WITHOUT A BREAK? ARE VARIETY MODERATION AND BALANCE INSTRUMENTS WE USE TO KEEP US FROM BOILING IN ANY INFERNO OF EXCESS' WHETHER IT BE CHEESECAKE OR RAVENOUS SEX?

VALET: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

GARCIN: YOUR EYELIDS. WE MOVE OURS UP AND DOWN. BLINKING WE CALL IT. IT'S LIKE A SMALL BLACK SHUTTER THAT CLICKS DOWN AND MAKES A BREAK. EVERYTHING GOES BLACK; ONE'S EYES ARE MOISTENED. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW RESTFUL REFRESHING IT IS. FOUR THOUSAND LITTLE RESTS PER HOUR. FOUR THOUSAND LITTLE RESPITES—JUST THINK!...SO THAT'S THE IDEA. I'M TO LIVE WITHOUT EYELIDS. DON'T ACT THE FOOL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. NO EYELIDS NO SLEEP; IT FOLLOWS DOESN'T IT? I SHALL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN. BUT THEN—HOW SHALL I ENDURE MY OWN COMPANY? TRY TO UNDERSTAND. YOU SEE I'M FOND OF TEASING IT'S A SECOND NATURE WITH ME— AND I'M USED TO TEASING MYSELF. PLAGUING MYSELF IF YOU PREFER; I DON'T TEASE NICELY. BUT I CAN'T GO ON DOING THAT WITHOUT A BREAK. DOWN THERE I HAD MY NIGHTS. I SLEPT. I ALWAYS HAD GOOD NIGHTS. BY WAY OF COMPENSATION I SUPPOSE. AND HAPPY LITTLE DREAMS. THERE WAS A GREEN FIELD. JUST AN ORDINARY FIELD. I USED TO STROLL IN IT...IS IT DAYTIME NOW?

VALET: CAN'T YOU SEE? THE LIGHTS ARE ON.

GARCIN: AH YES I'VE GOT IT. IT'S YOUR DAYTIME. AND OUTSIDE?

VALET: OUTSIDE?

GARCIN: DAMN IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BEYOND THAT WALL.

VALET: THERE'S A PASSAGE.

GARCIN: AND AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE?

VALET: THERE'S MORE ROOMS MORE PASSAGES AND STAIRS.

GARCIN: AND WHAT LIES BEYOND THEM?

VALET: THAT'S ALL.

GARCIN: BUT SURELY YOU HAVE A DAY OFF SOMETIMES. WHERE DO YOU GO?

VALET: TO MY UNCLE'S PLACE. HE'S THE HEAD VALET HERE. HE HAS A ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

GARCIN: I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED AS MUCH. WHERE'S THE LIGHT-SWITCH?

VALET: THERE ISN'T ANY.

GARCIN: WHAT? CAN'T ONE TURN OFF THE LIGHT?

VALET: OH THE MANAGEMENT CAN CUT OFF THE CURRENT IF THEY WANT TO. BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THEIR HAVING DONE SO ON THIS FLOOR. WE HAVE ALL THE ELECTRICITY WE WANT.

GARCIN: SO ONE HAS TO LIVE WITH ONE'S EYES OPEN ALL THE TIME?

VALET: TO LIVE DID YOU SAY?

GARCIN: DON'T LET'S QUIBBLE OVER WORDS. WITH ONE'S EYES OPEN. FOREVER. ALWAYS BROAD DAYLIGHT IN MY EYES— AND IN MY HEAD. AND SUPPOSE I TOOK THAT CONTRAPTION ON THE MANTELPIECE AND DROPPED IT ON THE LAMP— WOULDN'T IT GO OUT? VALET: YOU CAN'T MOVE IT. IT'S TOO HEAVY.

GARCIN: YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S TOO HEAVY.

VALET: VERY WELL SIR IF YOU DON'T NEED ME ANY MORE I'LL BE OFF.

GARCIN: WHAT? YOU'RE GOING? WAIT. THAT'S A BELL ISN'T IT? AND IF I RING YOU'RE BOUND TO COME?

VALET: WELL YES THAT'S SO— IN A WAY. BUT YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE ABOUT THAT BELL. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WIRING AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.

GARCIN: IT'S WORKING ALL RIGHT.

VALET: SO IT IS. BUT I SHOULDN'T COUNT ON IT TOO MUCH IF I WERE YOU. IT'S— CAPRICIOUS. WELL I REALLY MUST GO NOW. YES SIR?

GARCIN: NO NEVER MIND. WHAT'S THIS?

VALET: CAN'T YOU SEE? AN ORDINARY PAPER-KNIFE.

GARCIN: ARE THERE BOOKS HERE?

VALET: NO.

GARCIN: THEN WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS? VERY WELL. YOU CAN GO. (GARCIN IS BY HIMSELF. HE GOES TO THE BRONZE ORNAMENT AND STROKES IT REFLECTIVELY. HE SITS DOWN; THEN GETS UP GOES TO THE BELL-PUSH AND PRESSES THE BUTTON. THE BELL REMAINS SILENT. HE TRIES TWO OR THREE TIMES WITHOUT SUCCESS. THEN HE TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR ALSO WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE CALLS THE VALET SEVERAL TIMES BUT GETS NO RESULT. HE BEATS THE DOOR WITH HIS FISTS STILL CALLING. SUDDENLY HE GROWS CALM AND SITS DOWN AGAIN. AT THE SAME MOMENT THE DOOR OPENS AND INEZ ENTERS FOLLOWED BY THE VALET>)

HOW DOES SARTRE CREATE A SENSE OF PLACE THROUGH DIALOGUE? CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO STAY AWAKE ALL THE TIME WITH THE LIGHTS ON WITH NO HOPE OF LEAVING A SPECIFIC PLACE? HOW DOES GARCIN REACT TO THIS HELL? HOW COULD YOU TWIST YOUR DAILY ACTIVITIES AROUND SO THAT EVERYDAY HABITS BECOME HELL? IS THERE A PATTERN OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REINFORCES THE EXPERIENCE OF HELL?

VALET: DID YOU CALL SIR?

GARCIN: (ABOUT TO ANSWER "YES" BUT SEES INEZ AND SAYS) NO.

VALET: THIS IS YOUR ROOM MADAM. IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION YOU REQUIRE—? MOST OF OUR GUESTS HAVE QUITE A LOT TO ASK ME. BUT I WON'T INSIST. ANYHOW AS REGARDS THE TOOTHBRUSH AND THE ELECTRIC BELL AND THAT THING ON THE MANTELSHELF THIS GENTLEMAN CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW AS WELL AS I COULD. WE'VE HAD A LITTLE CHAT HIM AND ME. (EXITS.)

INEZ: WHERE'S FLORENCE? DIDN'T YOU HEAR? I ASKED YOU ABOUT FLORENCE. WHERE IS SHE?

GARCIN: I HAVEN'T AN IDEA.

INEZ: AH THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS IS IT? TORTURE BY SEPARATION. WELL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE. FLORENCE WAS A TIRESOME LITTLE FOOL AND I SHAN'T MISS HER IN THE LEAST.

GARCIN: I BEG YOUR PARDON. WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM? INEZ: YOU? WHY THE TORTURER OF COURSE.

GARCIN: WELL THAT'S A GOOD ONE! TOO COMIC FOR WORDS. I THE TORTURER! SO YOU CAME IN HAD A LOOK AT ME AND THOUGHT I WAS—ER—ONE OF THE STAFF. OF COURSE IT'S THAT SILLY FELLOW'S FAULT; HE SHOULD HAVE INTRODUCED US. A TORTURER INDEED! I'M JOSEPH GARCIN JOURNALIST AND MAN OF LETTERS BY PROFESSION. AND AS WE'RE BOTH IN THE SAME BOAT SO TO SPEAK MIGHT I ASK YOU MRS.—?

INEZ:NOT "MRS." I'M UNMARRIED.

GARCIN: RIGHT. THAT'S A START ANYWAY. WELL NOW THAT WE'VE BROKEN THE ICE DO YOU REALLY THINK I LOOK LIKE A TORTURER? AND BY THE WAY HOW DOES ONE RECOGNIZE TORTURERS WHEN ONE SEES THEM? EVIDENTLY YOU'VE IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT.

INEZ: THEY LOOK FRIGHTENED.

GARCIN: FRIGHTENED? BUT HOW RIDICULOUS! OF WHOM SHOULD THEY BE FRIGHTENED? OF THEIR VICTIMS?

INEZ: LAUGH AWAY BUT I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'VE OFTEN WATCHED MY FACE IN THE GLASS.

GARCIN: IN THE GLASS? HOW BEASTLY OF THEM! THEY'VE REMOVED EVERYTHING IN THE LEAST RESEMBLING A GLASS. ANYHOW I CAN ASSURE YOU I'M NOT FRIGHTENED. NOT THAT I TAKE MY POSITION LIGHTLY; I REALIZE ITS GRAVITY ONLY TOO WELL. BUT I'M NOT AFRAID.

INEZ: THAT'S YOUR AFFAIR. MUST YOU BE HERE ALL THE TIME OR DO YOU TAKE A STROLL OUTSIDE NOW AND THEN?

GARCIN: THE DOOR'S LOCKED. OH!.. THAT'S TOO BAD.

GARCIN: I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT IT BORES YOU HAVING ME HERE. AND I TOO—WELL QUITE FRANKLY I'D RATHER BE ALONE. I WANT TO THINK THINGS OUT YOU KNOW; TO SET MY LIFE IN ORDER AND ONE DOES THAT BETTER BY ONESELF. BUT I'M SURE WE'LL MANAGE TO PULL ALONG TOGETHER SOMEHOW. I'M NO TALKER I DON'T MOVE MUCH; IN FACT I'M A PEACEFUL SORT OF FELLOW. ONLY IF I MAY VENTURE ON A SUGGESTION WE SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF BEING EXTREMELY COURTEOUS TO EACH OTHER. THAT WILL EASE THE SITUATION FOR US BOTH.

INEZ: I'M NOT POLITE.

GARCIN: THEN I MUST BE POLITE FOR TWO.

INEZ: YOUR MOUTH!

GARCIN: I BEG YOUR PARDON.

INEZ: CAN'T YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH STILL? YOU KEEP TWISTING IT ABOUT ALL THE TIME. IT'S GROTESQUE.

GARCIN: SO SORRY. I WASN'T AWARE OF IT.

INEZ: THAT'S JUST WHAT I REPROACH YOU WITH. THERE YOU ARE! YOU TALK ABOUT POLITENESS AND YOU DON'T EVEN TRY TO CONTROL YOUR FACE. REMEMBER YOU'RE NOT ALONE; YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO INFLICT THE SIGHT OF YOUR FEAR ON ME.

GARCIN: HOW ABOUT YOU? AREN'T YOU AFRAID?

INEZ: WHAT WOULD BE THE USE? THERE WAS SOME POINT IN BEING AFRAID BEFORE WHILE ONE STILL HAD HOPE.

GARCIN: THERE'S NO MORE HOPE—BUT IT'S STILL "BEFORE." WE HAVEN'T YET BEGUN TO SUFFER.

INEZ: THAT'S SO. WELL? WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

GARCIN: I DON'T KNOW. I'M WAITING. (ENTER ESTELLE WITH THE VALET. SHE LOOKS AT GARCIN WHOSE FACE IS STILL HIDDEN BY HIS HANDS.)

ESTELLE: NO. DON'T LOOK UP. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HIDING WITH YOUR HANDS. I KNOW YOU'VE NO FACE LEFT. WHAT! BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU!

GARCIN: I'M NOT THE TORTURER MADAM.

ESTELLE: I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE. I —I THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO PLAY A RATHER NASTY TRICK ON ME. IS ANYONE ELSE COMING?

VALET: NO MADAM. NO ONE ELSE IS COMING.

ESTELLE: OH! THEN WE'RE TO STAY BY OURSELVES THE THREE OF US THIS GENTLEMAN THIS LADY AND MYSELF (LAUGHS.)

GARCIN: THERE'S NOTHING TO LAUGH ABOUT.

ESTELLE: IT'S THOSE SOFAS. THEY'RE SO HIDEOUS. AND JUST LOOK HOW THEY'VE BEEN ARRANGED. IT MAKES ME THINK OF NEW YEAR'S DAY—WHEN I USED TO VISIT THAT BORING OLD AUNT OF MINE AUNT MARY. HER HOUSE IS FULL OF HORROR LIKE THAT...I SUPPOSE EACH OF US HAS A SOFA OF HIS OWN. IS THAT ONE MINE? BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO SIT ON THAT ONE. IT WOULD BE TOO HORRIBLE FOR WORDS. I'M IN PALE BLUE AND IT'S VIVID GREEN.

INEZ: WOULD YOU PREFER MINE?

ESTELLE: THAT CLARET-COLORED ONE YOU MEAN? THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU BUT REALLY- NO I DON'T THINK IT'D BE SO MUCH BETTER. WHAT'S THE GOOD OF WORRYING ANYHOW? WE'VE GOT TO TAKE WHAT COMES TO US AND I'LL STICK TO THE GREEN ONE. THE ONLY ONE WHICH MIGHT DO AT A PINCH IS THAT GENTLEMAN'S.

INEZ: DID YOU HEAR MR. GARCIN?

GARCIN: OH— THE SOFA YOU MEAN. SO SORRY. PLEASE TAKE IT MADAM.

ESTELLE: THANKS. WELL AS WE'RE TO LIVE TOGETHER I SUPPOSE WE'D BETTER INTRODUCE OURSELVES. MY NAME'S RIGAULT. ESTELLE RIGAULT.

INEZ: AND I'M INEZ SERRANO. VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

GARCIN: JOSEPH GARCIN.

VALET: DO YOU REQUIRE ME ANY LONGER?

ESTELLE: NO YOU CAN GO. I'LL RING WHEN I WANT YOU.

INEZ: YOU'RE VERY PRETTY. I WISH WE'D HAD SOME FLOWERS TO WELCOME YOU WITH.

ESTELLE: FLOWERS? YES I LOVED FLOWERS. ONLY THEY'D FADE SO QUICKLY HERE WOULDN'T THEY? IT'S SO STUFFY. OH WELL THE GREAT THING IS TO KEEP AS CHEERFUL AS WE CAN DON'T YOU AGREE? OF COURSE YOU TOO ARE—

INEZ: YES. LAST WEEK. WHAT ABOUT YOU?

ESTELLE: I'M— QUITE RECENT. YESTERDAY. AS A MATTER OF ACT THE CEREMONY'S NOT QUITE OVER. THE WIND'S BLOWING MY SISTER'S VEIL ALL OVER THE PLACE. SHE'S TRYING HER BEST TO CRY. COME DEAR! MAKE ANOTHER EFFORT. THAT'S BETTER. TWO TEARS TWO LITTLE TEARS ARE TWINKLING UNDER THE BLACK VEIL. OH DEAR! WHAT A SIGHT OLGA LOOKS THIS MORNING! SHE'S HOLDING MY SISTER'S ARM HELPING HER ALONG. SHE'S NOT CRYING AND I DON'T BLAME HER TEARS ALWAYS MESS ONE'S FACE UP DON'T THEY? OLGA WAS MY BOSOM FRIEND YOU KNOW.

INEZ: DID YOU SUFFER MUCH?

ESTELLE: NO. I WAS ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS MOSTLY.

INEZ: WHAT WAS IT?

ESTELLE: PNEUMONIA. IT'S OVER NOW THEY'RE LEAVING THE CEMETERY. GOOD-BY. GOOD-BY. QUITE A CROWD THEY ARE. MY HUSBAND'S STAYED AT HOME. PROSTRATED WITH GRIEF POOR MAN. HOW ABOUT YOU?

INEZ: THE GAS STOVE. ESTELLE: AND YOU MR. GARCIN?

GARCIA: TWELVE BULLETS THROUGH MY CHEST. SORRY! I FEAR I'M NOT GOOD COMPANY AMONG THE DEAD.

ESTELLE: PLEASE PLEASE DON'T USE THAT WORD. IT'S SO—SO CRUDE. IN TERRIBLY BAD TASTE REALLY. IT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH ANYHOW. SOMEHOW I FEEL WE'VE NEVER BEEN SO MUCH ALIVE AS NOW. IF WE'VE ABSOLUTELY GOT TO MENTION THIS—THIS STATE OF THINGS I SUGGEST WE CALL OURSELVES—WAIT!—ABSENTEES. HAVE YOU BEEN—BEEN ABSENT FOR LONG?

GARCIN: ABOUT A MONTH.

ESTELLE: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?

GARCIN: FROM RIO.

ESTELLE: I'M FROM PARIS. HAVE YOU ANYONE LEFT DOWN THERE?

GARCIN: YES MY WIFE. SHE'S WAITING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE BARRACKS. SHE COMES THERE EVERY DAY. BUT THEY WON'T LET HER IN. NOW SHE'S TRYING TO PEEP BETWEEN THE BARS. SHE DOESN'T YET KNOW I'M— ABSENT BUT SHE SUSPECTS IT. NOW SHE'S GOING AWAY. SHE'S WEARING HER BLACK DRESS. SO MUCH THE BETTER SHE WON'T NEED TO CHANGE. SHE ISN'T CRYING BUT SHE NEVER DID CRY ANYHOW. IT'S A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY AND SHE'S LIKE A BLACK SHADOW CREEPING DOWN THE EMPTY STREET. THOSE BIG TRAGIC EYES OF HERS— WITH THAT MARTYRED LOOK THEY ALWAYS HAD. OH HOW SHE GOT ON MY NERVES!

INEZ: ESTELLE!

ESTELLE: PLEASE MR. GARCIN!

GARCIN: WHAT IS IT?

ESTELLE: YOU'RE SITTING ON MY SOFA.

GARCIN: I BEG YOUR PARDON.

ESTELLE: YOU LOOKED SO—SO FAR AWAY. SORRY I DISTURBED YOU.

GARCIN: I WAS SETTING MY LIFE IN ORDER. YOU MAY LAUGH BUT YOU'D DO BETTER TO FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE.

INEZ: NO NEED. MY LIFE'S IN PERFECT ORDER. IT TIDIED ITSELF UP NICELY OF ITS OWN ACCORD. SO I NEEDN'T BOTHER ABOUT IT NOW.

GARCIN: REALLY? YOU IMAGINE IT'S SO SIMPLE AS THAT. WHEW! HOW HOT IT IS HERE! DO YOU MIND IF—

ESTELLE: HOW DARE YOU! NO PLEASE DON'T. I LOATHE MEN IN THEIR SHIRT-SLEEVES.

GARCIN: ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE I USED TO SPEND MY NIGHTS IN THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE AND IT WAS A REGULAR BLACK HOLE SO WE NEVER KEPT OUR COATS ON. STIFLINGLY HOT IT COULD BE. STIFLING THAT IT IS. IT'S NIGHT NOW.

ESTELLE: THAT'S SO. OLGA'S UNDRESSING; IT MUST BE AFTER MIDNIGHT. HOW QUICKLY THE TIME PASSES ON EARTH!

INEZ: YES AFTER MIDNIGHT. THEY'VE SEALED UP MY ROOM. IT'S DARK PITCH-DARK AND EMPTY.

GARCIN: THEY'VE STRUNG THEIR COATS ON THE BACKS OF THE CHAIRS AND ROLLED UP THEIR SHIRTSLEEVES ABOVE THE ELBOW. THE AIR STINKS OF MEN AND CIGAR-SMOKE. I USED TO LIKE LIVING AMONG MEN IN THEIR SHIRT-SLEEVES.

ESTELLE: WELL IN THAT CASE OUR TASTES DIFFER. THAT'S ALL IT PROVES. WHAT ABOUT YOU? DO YOU LIKE MEN IN THEIR SHIRT-SLEEVES?

INEZ: OH I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR MEN ANY WAY.

ESTELLE: REALLY I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THEY PUT US THREE TOGETHER. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

INEZ: WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?

ESTELLE: I'M LOOKING AT YOU TWO AND THINKING THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER...IT'S SO ABSURD. I EXPECTED TO MEET OLD FRIENDS OR RELATIVES.

INEZ: YES A CHARMING OLD FRIEND— WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FACE.

ESTELLE: YES HIM TOO. HE DANCED THE TANGO SO DIVINELY. LIKE A PROFESSIONAL...BUT WHY WHY SHOULD WE OF ALL PEOPLE BE PUT TOGETHER?

GARCIN: A PURE FLUKE I SHOULD SAY. THEY LODGE FOLKS AS THEY CAN IN THE ORDER OF THEIR COMING. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

INEZ: BECAUSE YOU AMUSE ME WITH YOUR "FLUKES."AS IF THEY LEFT ANYTHING TO CHANCE! BUT I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT TO REASSURE YOURSELF SOMEHOW.

ESTELLE: I WONDER NOW. DON'T YOU THINK WE MAY HAVE MET EACH OTHER AT SOME TIME IN OUR LIVES?

INEZ: NEVER. I SHOULDN'T HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU.

ESTELLE: OR PERHAPS WE HAVE FRIENDS IN COMMON. I WONDER IF YOU KNOW THE DUBOIS-SEYMOURS?

INEZ: NOT LIKELY.

ESTELLE: BUT EVERYONE WENT TO THEIR PARTIES.

INEZ: WHAT'S THEIR JOB?

ESTELLE: OH THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. BUT THEY HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY AND HOSTS OF PEOPLE VISIT THEM.

INEZ: I DIDN'T. I WAS A POST-OFFICE CLERK.

ESTELLE: AH YES... OF COURSE IN THAT CASE— AND YOU MR. GARCIN?

GARCIN: WE'VE NEVER MET. I ALWAYS LIVED IN RIO.

ESTELLE: THEN YOU MUST BE RIGHT. IT'S MERE CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

INEZ: MERE CHANCE? THEN IT'S BY CHANCE THIS ROOM IS FURNISHED AS WE SEE IT. IT'S AN ACCIDENT THAT THE SOFA ON THE RIGHT IS A LIVID GREEN AND THAT ONE ON THE LEFT'S WINE-RED. MERE CHANCE? WELL JUST TRY TO SHIFT THE SOFAS AND YOU'LL SEE THE DIFFERENCE QUICK ENOUGH. AND THAT STATUE ON THE MANTELPIECE DO YOU THINK IT'S THERE BY ACCIDENT? AND WHAT ABOUT THE HEAT HERE? HOW ABOUT THAT? I TELL YOU THEY'VE THOUGHT IT ALL OUT. DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL. NOTHING WAS LEFT TO CHANCE. THIS ROOM WAS ALL SET FOR US.

ESTELLE: BUT REALLY! EVERYTHING HERE'S SO HIDEOUS; ALL IN ANGLES SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I ALWAYS LOATHED ANGLES.

INEZ: AND DO YOU THINK I LIVED IN A SECOND EMPIRE DRAWING-ROOM? ESTELLE: SO IT WAS ALL FIXED UP BEFOREHAND? INEZ: YES. AND THEY'VE PUT US TOGETHER DELIBERATELY.

ESTELLE: THEN IT'S NOT MERE CHANCE THAT YOU PRECISELY ARE SITTING OPPOSITE ME? BUT WHAT CAN BE THE IDEA BEHIND IT?

INEZ: ASK ME ANOTHER! I ONLY KNOW THEY'RE WAITING.

ESTELLE: I NEVER COULD BEAR THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S EXPECTING SOMETHING FROM ME. IT ALWAYS MADE ME WANT TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE.

INEZ: WELL DO IT. DO IT IF YOU CAN. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY EXPECT.

ESTELLE: IT'S OUTRAGEOUS! SO SOMETHING'S COMING TO ME FROM YOU TWO? SOMETHING NASTY I SUPPOSE. THERE ARE SOME FACES THAT TELL ME EVERYTHING AT ONCE. YOURS DON'T CONVEY ANYTHING.

GARCIN: LOOK HERE! WHY ARE WE TOGETHER? YOU'VE GIVEN US QUITE ENOUGH HINTS YOU MAY AS WELL COME OUT WITH IT.

INEZ: BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. I'M AS MUCH IN THE DARK AS YOU ARE.

GARCIN: WE'VE GOT TO KNOW.

INEZ: IF ONLY EACH OF US HAD THE GUTS TO TELL—

GARCIN: TELL WHAT?

INEZ: ESTELLE!

ESTELLE: YES?

INEZ: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I MEAN WHY HAVE THEY SENT YOU HERE?

ESTELLE: THAT'S JUST IT. I HAVEN'T A NOTION NOT THE FOGGIEST. IN FACT I'M WONDERING IF THERE HASN'T BEEN SOME GHASTLY MISTAKE. DON'T SMILE. JUST THINK OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO-WHO BECOME ABSENTEES EVERY DAY. THERE MUST BE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND PROBABLY THEY'RE SORTED OUT BY— BY UNDERSTRAPPERS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. STUPID EMPLOYEES WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR JOB. SO THEY'RE BOUND TO MAKE MISTAKES SOMETIMES... DO STOP SMILING. WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK? IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE IN MY CASE THEY MAY HAVE DONE THE SAME ABOUT YOU. AND YOU TOO. ANYHOW ISN'T IT BETTER TO THINK WE'VE GOT HERE BY MISTAKE?

INEZ: IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO TELL ME?

ESTELLE: WHAT ELSE SHOULD I TELL? I'VE NOTHING TO HIDE. I LOST MY PARENTS WHEN I WAS A KID AND I HAD MY YOUNG BROTHER TO BRING UP. WE WERE TERRIBLY POOR AND WHEN AN OLD FRIEND OF MY PEOPLE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM I SAID YES. HE WAS VERY WELL OFF AND QUITE NICE. MY BROTHER WAS A VERY DELICATE CHILD AND NEEDED ALL SORTS OF ATTENTION SO REALLY THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING FOR ME TO DO DON'T YOU AGREE? MY HUSBAND WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY FATHER BUT FOR SIX YEARS WE HAD A HAPPY MARRIED LIFE. THEN TWO YEARS AGO I MET THE MAN I WAS FATED TO LOVE. WE KNEW IT THE MOMENT WE SET EYES ON EACH OTHER. HE ASKED ME TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM AND I REFUSED. THEN I GOT PNEUMONIA AND IT FINISHED ME. THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY. NO DOUBT BY CERTAIN STANDARDS I DID WRONG TO SACRIFICE MY YOUTH TO A MAN NEARLY THREE TIMES MY AGE. DO YOU THINK THAT COULD BE CALLED A SIN?

GARCIN: CERTAINLY NOT. AND NOW TELL ME DO YOU THINK IT'S A CRIME TO STAND BY ONE'S PRINCIPLES?

ESTELLE: OF COURSE NOT. SURELY NO ONE COULD BLAME A MAN FOR THAT!

GARCIN: WAIT A BIT! I RAN A PACIFIST NEWSPAPER. THEN WAR BROKE OUT. WHAT WAS I TO DO? EVERYONE WAS WATCHING ME WONDERING: "WILL HE DARE?" WELL I DARED. I FOLDED MY ARMS AND THEY SHOT ME. HAD I DONE ANYTHING WRONG?

ESTELLE: WRONG? ON THE CONTRARY. YOU WERE— INEZ: —A HERO! AND HOW ABOUT YOUR WIFE MR. GARCIN? GARCIN: THAT'S SIMPLE. I'D RESCUED HER FROM— FROM THE GUTTER.

ESTELLE: YOU SEE! YOU SEE!

INEZ: YES I SEE. LOOK HERE! WHAT' S THE POINT OF PLAY-ACTING TRYING TO THROW DUST IN EACH OTHER'S EYES? WE'RE ALL TARRED WITH THE SAME BRUSH.

ESTELLE: HOW DARE YOU!

INEZ: YES WE ARE CRIMINALS— MURDERERS— ALL THREE OF US. WE'RE IN HELL MY PETS; THEY NEVER MAKE MISTAKES AND PEOPLE AREN'T DAMNED FOR NOTHING.

ESTELLE: STOP! FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE—

INEZ: IN HELL! DAMNED SOULS— THAT'S US ALL THREE!

ESTELLE: KEEP QUIET! I FORBID YOU TO USE SUCH DISGUSTING WORDS.

INEZ: A DAMNED SOUL— THAT'S YOU MY LITTLE PLASTER SAINT. AND DITTO OUR FRIEND THERE THE NOBLE PACIFIST. WE'VE HAD OUR HOUR OF PLEASURE HAVEN'T WE? THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO BURNED THEIR LIVES OUT FOR OUR SAKES— AND WE CHUCKLED OVER IT. SO NOW WE HAVE TO PAY THE RECKONING.

GARCIN: WILL YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT DAMN IT!

INEZ: WELL WELL! AH I UNDERSTAND NOW. I KNOW WHY THEY'VE PUT US THREE TOGETHER.

GARCIN: I ADVISE YOU TO— TO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU SAY ANY MORE.

INEZ: WAIT! YOU'LL SEE HOW SIMPLE IT IS. CHILDISHLY SIMPLE. OBVIOUSLY THERE AREN'T ANY PHYSICAL TORMENTS— YOU AGREE DON'T YOU? AND YET WE'RE IN HELL. AND NO ONE ELSE WILL COME HERE. WE'LL STAY IN THIS ROOM TOGETHER THE THREE OF US FOR EVER AND EVER...IN SHORT THERE'S SOMEONE ABSENT HERE THE OFFICIAL TORTURER.

GARCIN: I'D NOTICED THAT.

INEZ: IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT THEY'RE AFTER— AN ECONOMY OF MAN-POWER— OR DEVIL-POWER IF YOU PREFER. THE SAME IDEA AS IN THE CAFETERIA WHERE CUSTOMERS SERVE THEMSELVES.

ESTELLE: WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

INEZ: I MEAN THAT EACH OF US WILL ACT AS TORTURER OF THE TWO OTHERS.

GARCIN: NO I SHALL NEVER BE YOUR TORTURER. I WISH NEITHER OF YOU ANY HARM AND I'VE NO CONCERN WITH YOU. NONE AT ALL. SO THE SOLUTION'S EASY ENOUGH; EACH OF US STAYS PUT IN HIS OR HER CORNER AND TAKES NO NOTICE OF THE OTHERS. YOU HERE YOU HERE AND I THERE. LIKE SOLDIERS AT OUR POSTS. ALSO WE MUSTN'T SPEAK. NOT ONE WORD. THAT WON'T BE DIFFICULT; EACH OF US HAS PLENTY OF MATERIAL FOR SELF-COMMUNING. I THINK I COULD STAY TEN THOUSAND YEARS WITH ONLY MY THOUGHTS FOR COMPANY.

ESTELLE: HAVE I GOT TO KEEP SILENT TOO?

GARCIN: YES. AND THAT WAY WE—WE'LL WORK OUT OUR SALVATION. LOOKING INTO OURSELVES NEVER RAISING OUR HEADS. AGREED?

INEZ: AGREED. ESTELLE: I AGREE.

GARCIN: THEN-GOOD-BY.

(INEZ SINGS TO HERSELF WHILE ESTELLE HAS BEEN PLYING HER POWDER-PUFF AND LIPSTICK. SHE

LOOKS ROUND FOR A MIRROR FUMBLES IN HER BAG THEN TURNS TOWARD GARCIN.

ESTELLE: EXCUSE ME HAVE YOU A GLASS? ANY SORT OF GLASS A POCKET-MIRROR WILL DO. (GARCIN REMAINS SILENT.) EVEN IF YOU WON'T SPEAK TO ME YOU MIGHT LEND ME A GLASS.

INEZ: DON'T WORRY. I'VE A GLASS IN MY BAG. IT'S GONE! THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN IT FROM ME AT THE ENTRANCE.

ESTELLE: HOW TIRESOME! (ESTELLE SHUTS HER EYES AND SWAYS AS IF ABOUT TO FAINT. INEZ RUNS FORWARD AND HOLDS HER UP.)

INEZ: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

ESTELLE: I FEEL SO QUEER. DON'T YOU EVER GET TAKEN THAT WAY? WHEN I CAN'T SEE MYSELF I BEGIN TO WONDER IF I REALLY AND TRULY EXIST. I PAT MYSELF JUST TO MAKE SURE BUT IT DOESN'T HELP MUCH.

INEZ: YOU'RE LUCKY. I'M ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF— IN MY MIND. PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS.

ESTELLE: AH YES IN YOUR MIND. BUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN ONE'S HEAD IS SO VAGUE ISN'T IT? IT MAKES ONE WANT TO SLEEP. I'VE SIX BIG MIRRORS IN MY BEDROOM. THERE THEY ARE. I CAN SEE THEM. BUT THEY DON'T SEE ME. THEY'RE REFLECTING THE CARPET THE SETTEE THE WINDOW-- BUT HOW EMPTY IT IS A GLASS IN WHICH I'M ABSENT! WHEN I TALKED TO PEOPLE I ALWAYS MADE SURE THERE WAS ONE NEAR BY IN WHICH I COULD SEE MYSELF. I WATCHED MYSELF TALKING. AND SOMEHOW IT KEPT ME ALERT SEEING MYSELF AS THE OTHERS SAW ME...OH DEAR! MY LIPSTICK! I'M SURE I'VE PUT IT ON ALL CROOKED. NO I CAN'T DO WIHTOUT A LOOKING-GLASS FOR EVER AND EVER. I SIMPLY CAN'T.

INEZ: SUPPOSE I TRY TO BE YOUR GLASS? COME AND PAY ME A VISIT DEAR. HERE'S A PLACE FOR YOU ON MY SOFA.

ESTELLE: BUT—(POINTS TO GARCIN)

INEZ: OH HE DOESN'T COUNT.

ESTELLE: BUT WE'RE GOING TO —TO HURT EACH OTHER. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

INEZ: DO I LOOK AS IF I WANTED TO HURT YOU?

ESTELLE: ONE NEVER CAN TELL.

INEZ: MUCH MORE LIKELY YOU'LL HURT ME. STILL WHAT DOES IT MATTER? IF I'VE GOT TO SUFFER IT MAY AS WELL BE AT YOUR HANDS YOUR PRETTY HANDS. SIT DOWN. COME CLOSER. CLOSER. LOOK INTO MY EYES. WHAT DO YOU SEE?

ESTELLE: OH I'M THERE! BUT SO TINY I CAN'T SEE MYSELF PROPERLY.

INEZ: BUT I CAN. EVERY INCH OF YOU. NOW ASK ME QUESTIONS. I'LL BE AS CANDID AS ANY LOOKING-GLASS.

ESTELLE: PLEASE MR. GARCIN. SURE OUR CHATTER ISN'T BORING YOU?

INEZ: DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM. AS I SAID HE DOESN'T COUNT. WE'RE BY OURSELVES...ASK AWAY.

ESTELLE: ARE MY LIPS ALL RIGHT?

INEZ: SHOW! NO THEY'RE A BIT SMUDGY.

ESTELLE: I THOUGHT AS MUCH. LUCKILY NO ONE'S SEEN ME. I'LL TRY AGAIN.

INEZ: THAT'S BETTER. NO. FOLLOW THE LINE OF YOUR LIPS. WAIT!! I'LL GUIDE YOUR HAND. THERE. THAT'S QUITE GOOD.

ESTELLE: AS GOOD AS WHEN I CAME IN?

INEZ: FAR BETTER. CRUDER. YOUR MOUTH LOOKS QUITE DIABOLICAL THAT WAY.

ESTELLE: GOOD GRACIOUS! AND YOU SAY YOU LIKE IT! HOW MADDENING NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE FOR MYSELF! YOU'RE QUITE SURE MISS SERRANO THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW?

INEZ: WON'T YOU CALL ME INEZ? ESTELLE: ARE YOU SURE IT LOOKS ALL RIGHT? INEZ: YOU'RE LOVELY ESTELLE.

ESTELLE: BUT HOW CAN I RELY UPON YOUR TASTE? IS IT THE SAME AS MY TASTE? OH HOW SICKENING IT ALL IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE CRAZY!

INEZ: I HAVE YOUR TASTE MY DEAR BECAUSE I LIKE YOU SO MUCH. LOOK AT ME. NO STRAIGHT. NOW SMILE. I'M NOT SO UGLY EITHER. AM I NOT NICER THAN YOUR GLASS?

ESTELLE: OH I DON'T KNOW. YOUR SCARE ME RATHER. MY REFLECTION IN THE GLASS NEVER DID THAT; OF COURSE I KNEW IT SO WELL. LIKE SOMETHING I HAD TAMED...I'M GOING TO SMILE AND MY SMILE WILL SINK DOWN INTO YOUR PUPILS AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BECOME. INEZ: AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU "TAME" ME? LISTEN! I WANT YOU TO CALL ME INEZ. WE MUST BE GREAT FRIENDS.

ESTELLE: I DON'T MAKE FRIENDS WITH WOMEN VERY EASILY.

INEZ: NOT WITH POSTAL CLERKS YOU MEAN? HULLO WHAT'S THAT— THAT NASTY RED SPOT AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CHEEK? A PIMPLE?

ESTELLE: A PIMPLE? OH HOW SIMPLY FOUL! WHERE!

INEZ: THERE...YOU KNOW THE WAY THE CATCH LARKS— WITH A MIRROR? I'M YOUR LARK-MIRROR MY DEAR AND YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME...THERE ISN'T ANY PIMPLE NOT A TRACE OF ONE. SO WHAT ABOUT IT? SUPPOSE THE MIRROR STARTED TELLING LIES? OR SUPPOSE I COVERED MY EYES—AS HE IS DOING— AND REFUSED TO LOOK AT YOU ALL THAT LOVELINESS OF YOURS WOULD BE WASTED ON THE DESERT AIR. NO DON'T BE AFRAID I CAN'T HELP LOOKING AT YOU. I SHAN'T TURN MY EYES AWAY. AND I'LL BE NICE TO YOU EVER SO NICE. ONLY YOU MUST BE NICE TO ME TOO.

ESTELLE: ARE YOU REALLY— ATTRACTED BY ME?

INEZ: VERY MUCH INDEED.

ESTELLE: BUT I WISH HE'D NOTICE ME TOO.

INEZ: OF COURSE! BECAUSE HE'S A MAN! YOU'VE WON. BUT LOOK AT HER DAMN IT! DON'T PRETEND. YOU HAVEN'T MISSED A WORD OF WHAT WE'VE SAID.

GARCIN: QUITE SO; NOT A WORD. I STUCK MY FINGERS IN MY EARS BUT YOUR VOICES THUDDED IN MY BRAIN. SILLY CHATTER. NOW WILL YOU LEAVE ME IN PEACE YOU TWO? I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU.

INEZ: NOT IN ME PERHAPS—BUT HOW ABOUT THIS CHILD? AREN'T YOU INTERESTED IN HER? OH I SAW THROUGH YOUR GAME; YOU GOT ON YOUR HIGH HORSE JUST TO IMPRESS HER.

GARCIN: I ASKED YOU TO LEAVE ME IN PEACE. THERE'S SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT ME IN THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE AND I WANT TO LISTEN. AND IF IT'LL MAKE YOU ANY HAPPIER LET ME TELL YOU THAT I'VE NO USE FOR THE "CHILD" AS YOU CALL HER.

ESTELLE: THANKS.

GARCIN: OH I DIDN'T MEAN IT RUDELY.

ESTELLE: YOU CAD!

GARCIN: SO THAT'S THAT. YOU KNOW I BEGGED YOU NOT TO SPEAK.

ESTELLE: IT'S HER FAULT; SHE STARTED. I DIDN'T ASK ANYTHING OF HER AND SHE CAME AND OFFERED ME HER-HER GLASS.

INEZ: SO YOU SAY. BUT ALL THE TIME YOU WERE MAKING UP TO HIM TRYING EVERY TRICK TO CATCH HIS ATTENTION.

ESTELLE: WELL WHY SHOULDN'T I?

GARCIN: YOU'RE CRAZY BOTH OF YOU. DON'T YOU SEE WHERE THIS IS LEADING US? FOR PITY'S SAKE KEEP YOUR MOUTHS SHUT. NOW LET'S ALL SIT DOWN AGAIN QUITE QUIETLY; WE'LL LOOK AT THE FLOOR AND EACH MUST TRY TO FORGET THE OTHERS ARE THERE.

INEZ: TO FORGET ABOUT THE OTHERS? HOW UTTERLY ABSURD! I FEEL YOU THERE IN EVERY PORE. YOUR SILENCE CLAMORS IN MY EARS. YOU CAN NAIL UP YOUR MOUTH CUT YOUR TONGUE OUT— BUT YOU CAN'T PREVENT YOUR BEING THERE. CAN YOU STOP YOUR THOUGHTS? I HEAR THEM TICKING AWAY LIKE A CLOCK TICK-TOCK TICK-TOCK AND I'M CERTAIN YOU HEAR MINE. IT'S ALL VERY WELL SKULKING ON YOUR SOFA BUT YOU'RE EVERYWHERE AND EVERY SOUND COMES TO ME SOILED BECAUSE YOU'VE

INTERCEPTED IT ON ITS WAY. WHY YOU'VE EVEN STOLEN MY FACE; YOU KNOW IT AND I DON'T ! AND WHAT ABOUT HER ABOUT ESTELLE? YOU'VE STOLEN HER FROM ME TOO; IF SHE AND I WERE ALONE DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'D TREAT ME AS SHE DOES? NO TAKE YOUR HANDS FROM YOUR FACE I WON'T LEAVE YOU IN PEACE— THAT WOULD SUIT YOUR BOOK TOO WELL. YOU'D GO ON SITTING THERE IN A SORT OF TRANCE LIKE A YOGI AND EVEN IF I DIDN'T SEE HER I'D FEEL IT IN MY BONES— THAT SHE WAS MAKING EVERY SOUND EVEN THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS FOR YOUR BENEFIT THROWING YOU SMILES YOU DIDN'T SEE.... WELL I WON'T STAND FOR THAT I PREFER TO CHOOSE MY HELL; I PREFER TO LOOK YOU IN THE EYES AND FIGHT IT OUT FACE TO FACE.

GARCIN: HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY. I SUPPOSE WE WERE BOUND TO COME TO THIS; THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT AND WE'RE EASY GAME. IF THEY'D PUT ME IN A ROOM WITH MEN— MEN CAN KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT. BUT IT'S NO USE WANTING THE IMPOSSIBLE. SO I ATTRACT YOU LITTLE GIRL? (FONDLES HER.) IT SEEMS YOU WERE MAKING EYES AT ME?

ESTELLE: DON'T TOUCH ME.

GARCIN: WHY NOT? WE MIGHT ANYHOW BE NATURAL... DO YOU KNOW I USED TO BE MAD ABOUT WOMEN? AND SOME WERE FOND OF ME. SO WE MAY AS WELL STOP POSING WE'VE NOTHING TO LOSE. WHY TROUBLE ABOUT POLITENESS AND DECORUM AND THE REST OF IT? WE'RE BETWEEN OURSELVES. AND PRESENTLY WE SHALL BE NAKED AS — AS NEWBORN BABES.

ESTELLE: OH LET ME BE!

GARCIN: AS NEWBORN BABES. WELL I'D WARNED YOU ANYHOW. I ASKED SO LITTLE OF YOU NOTHING BUT PEACE AND A LITTLE SILENCE. I'D PUT MY FINGERS IN MY EARS. GOMEZ WAS SPOUTING AWAY AS USUAL STANDING IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM WITH ALL THE PRESSMEN LISTENING. IN THEIR SHIRT-SLEEVES. I TRIED TO HEAR BUT IT WASN'T EASY. THINGS ON EARTH MOVE SO QUICKLY YOU KNOW. COULDN'T YOU HAVE HELD YOUR TONGUES? NOW IT'S OVER HE'S STOPPED TALKING AND WHAT HE THINKS OF ME HAS GONE BACK INTO HIS HEAD. WELL WE'VE GOT TO SEE IT THROUGH SOMEHOW...NAKED AS WE WERE BORN. SO MUCH THE BETTER; I WANT TO KNOW WHOM I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

INEZ: YOU KNOW ALREADY. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO LEARN.

GARCIN: YOU'RE WRONG. SO LONG AS EACH OF US HASN'T MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT— WHY THEY'VE DAMNED HIM OR HER— WE KNOW NOTHING. NOTHING THAT COUNTS. YOU YOUNG LADY YOU SHALL BEGIN. WHY? TELL US WHY. IF YOU ARE FRANK IF WE BRING OUR SPECTERS INTO THE OPEN IT MAY SAVE US FROM DISASTER. SO- OUT WITH IT! WHY?

ESTELLE: I TELL YOU I HAVEN'T A NOTION. THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHY.

GARCIN: THAT'S SO. THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME EITHER. BUT I'VE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA... PERHAPS YOU'RE SHY OF SPEAKING FIRST? RIGHT. I'LL LEAD OFF. I'M NOT A VERY ESTIMABLE PERSON.

INEZ: NO NEED TO TELL US THAT. WE KNOW YOU WERE A DESERTER.

GARCIN: LET THAT BE. IT'S ONLY A SIDE-ISSUE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I TREATED MY WIFE ABOMINABLY. THAT'S ALL. FOR FIVE YEARS. NATURALLY SHE'S SUFFERING STILL. THERE SHE IS: THE MOMENT I MENTION HER I SEE HER. IT'S GOMEZ WHO INTERESTS ME AND IT'S SHE I SEE. WHERE'S GOMEZ GOT TO? FOR FIVE YEARS. THERE! THEY'VE GIVEN HER BACK MY THINGS; SHE'S SITTING BY THE WINDOW WITH MY COAT ON HER KNEES. THE COAT WITH THE TWELVE BULLET-HOLES. THE BLOOD'S LIKE RUST; A BROWN RING ROUND EACH HOLE. IT'S QUITE A MUSEUM-PIECE THAT COAT; SCARRED WITH HISTORY. AND I USED TO WEAR IT FANCY! ... NOW CAN'T YOU SHED A TEAR MY LOVE! SURELY YOU'LL SQUEEZE ONE OUT— AT LAST? NO? YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT? ... NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I CAME HOME BLIND DRUNK STINKING OF WINE AND WOMEN. SHE'D SAT UP FOR ME OF COURSE. BUT SHE NEVER CRIED NEVER UTTERED A WORD OF REPROACH. ONLY HER EYES SPOKE. BIG TRAGIC EYES. I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING. I MUST PAY THE PRICE BUT I SHAN'T WHINE.... IT'S SNOWING IN THE STREET. WON'T YOU CRY CONFOUND YOU? THAT WOMAN WAS A BORN MARTYR YOU KNOW; A VICTIM BY VOCATION.

INEZ: WHY DID YOU HURT HER LIKE THAT?

GARCIN: IT WAS SO EASY. A WORED WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HER FLINCH. LIKE A SENSITIVE-PLANT. BUT NEVER NEVER A REPROACH. I'M FOND OF TEASING. I WATCHED AND WAITED. BUT NO NOT A TEAR NOT A PROTEST. I'D PICKED HER UP OUT OF THE GUTTER YOU UNDERSTAND...NOW SHE'S STROKING THE COAT. HER EYES ARE SHUT AND SHE'S FEELING WITH HER FINGERES FOR THE BULLET-HOLES. WHAT ARE YOU AFTER? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? I TELL YOU I REGRET NOTHING. THE TRUTH IS SHE ADMIRED ME TOO MUCH. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

INEZ: NO. NOBODY ADMIRED ME.

GARCIN: SO MUCH THE BETTER. SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR YOU. I SUPPOSE ALL THIS TRIKES YOU AS VERY VAGUE. WELL HERE'S SOMETHING HOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO. I BROUGHT A HALF-CASTE GIRL TO STAY IN OUR HOUSE. MY WIFE SLEPT UPSTAIRS; SHE MUST HAVE HEARD— EVERYTHING. SHE WAS AN EARLY RISER AND AS I AND THE GIRL STAYED IN BED LATE SHE SERVED US OUR MORNING COFFEE.

INEZ: YOU BRUTE!

GARCIN: YES A BRUTE IF YOU LIKE. BUT A WELL-BELOVED BRUTE. (FAR-AWAY LOOK COMES TO HIS EYES.) NO IT'S NOTHING. ONLY GOMEZ AND HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT ME... WHAT WERE YOU SAYING? YES A BRUTE. CERTAINLY. ELSE WHY SHOULD I BE HERE? YOUR TURN.

INEZ: WELL I WAS WHAT SOME PEOPLE DOWN THERE CALLED " A DAMNED BITCH." DAMNED ALREADY. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE BEING HERE.

GARCIN: IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

INEZ: NO. THERE WAS THAT AFFAIR WITH FLORENCE. A DEAD MEN'S TALE. WITH THREE CORPSES TO IT. HE TO START WITH; THE SHE AND I. SO THERE'S NO ONE LEFT. I'VE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT; IT WAS A CLEAN SWEEP. ONLY THAT ROOM. I SEE IT NOW AND THEN. EMPTY WITH THE DOORS LOCKED.... NO THEY'VE JUST UNLOCKED THEM. "TO LET." IT'S TO LET; THERE'S A NOTICE ON THE DOOR THAT'S — TOO RIDICULOUS.

GARCIN: THREE. THREE DEATHS YOU SAID?

INEZ: THREE.

GARCIN: ONE MAN AND TWO WOMEN?

INEZ: YES.

GARCIN: WELL WELL. DID HE KILL HIMSELF?

INEZ: HE? NO HE HADN'T THE GUTS FOR THAT. STILL HE'D EVERY REASON; WE LED HIM A DOG'S LIFE. AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS RUN OVER BY A TRAM. A SILLY SORT OF END... I WAS LIVING WITH THEM; HE WAS MY COUSIN.

GARCIN: WAS FLORENCE FAIR?

INEZ: FAIR? YOU KNOW I DON'T REGRET A THING; STILL I'M NOT SO VERY KEEN ON TELLING YOU THE STORY.

GARCIN: THAT'S ALL RIGHT SO YOU GOT SICK OF HIM?

INEZ: QUITE GRADUALLY. ALL SORTS OF LITTLE THINGS GOT ON MY NERVES. FOR INSTANCE HE MADE A NOISE WHEN HE WAS DRINKING— A SORT OF GURGLE. TRIFLES LIKE THAT. HE WAS RATHER PATHETIC REALLY. VULNERABLE. WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

GARCIN: BECAUSE I ANYHOW AM NOT VULNERABLE.

INEZ: DON'T BE TOO SURE... I CREPT INSIDE HER SKIN SHE SAW THE WORLD THROUGH MY EYES. WHEN SHE LEFT HIM I HAD HER ON MY HANDS. WE SHARED A BED-SITTING-ROOM AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN.

GARCIN: AND THEN?

INEZ: THEN THAT TRAM DID ITS JOB. I USED TO REMIND HER EVERY DAY: "YES MY PET WE KILLED HIM BETWEEN US." I'M RATHER CRUEL REALLY.

GARCIN: SO AM I.

INEZ: NO YOU'RE NOT CRUEL. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

GARCIN: WHAT?

INEZ: I'LL TELL YOU LATER. WHEN I SAY I'M CRUEL I MEAN I CAN'T GET ON WITHOUT MAKING PEOPLE SUFFER. LIKE A LIVE COAL. A LIVEK COAL IN OTHERS' HEARTS. WHEN I'M ALONE I FLICKER OUT. FOR SIX MONTHS I FLAMED AWAY IN HER HEART TILL THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A CINDER. ONE NIGHT SHE GOT UP AND TURNED ON THE GAS WHILE I WAS ASLEEP. THEN SHE CREPT BACK INTO BED. SO NOW YOU KNOW.

GARCIN: WELL! WELL!

INEZ: YES? WHAT'S IN YOUR MIND?

GARCIN: NOTHING. ONLY THAT IT'S NOT A PRETTY STORY

INEZ: OBVIOUSLY. BUT WHAT MATTER?

GARCIN: AS YOU SAY WHAT MATTER? YOUR TURN. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.

ESTELLE: AS I TOLD YOU I HAVEN'T A NOTION. I RACK MY BRAIN BUT IT'S NO USE.

GARCIN: RIGHT. THEN WE'LL GIVE YOU A HAND. THAT FELLOW WITH THE SMASHED FACE WHO WAS HE?

ESTELLE: WHO— WHO DO YOU MEAN?

INEZ: YOU KNOW QUITE WELL. THE MAN YOU WERE SO SCARED OF SEEING WHEN YOU CAME IN.

ESTELLE: OH HIM! A FRIEND OF MINE.

GARCIN: WHY WERE YOU AFRAID OF HIM?

ESTELLE: THAT'S MY BUSINESS MR. GARCIN.

INEZ: DID HE SHOOT HIMSELF ON YOUR ACCOUNT?

ESTELLE: OF COURSE NOT. HOW ABSURD YOU ARE!

GARCIN: THEN WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE BEEN SO SCARED? HE BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT DIDN'T HE? THAT'S HOW HIS FACE GOT SMASHED.

ESTELLE: DON'T! PLEASE DON'T GO ON.

GARCIN: BECAUSE OF YOU. BECAUSE OF YOU. INEZ: HE SHOT HIMSELF BECAUSE OF YOU.

ESTELLE: LEAVE ME ALONE! IT'S — IT'S NOT FAIR BULLYING ME LIKE THAT. I WANT TO GO! I WANT TO GO!

GARCIN: GO IF YOU CAN. PERSONALLY I ASK FOR NOTHING BETTER. UNFORTUNATELY THE DOOR'S LOCKED.

ESTELLE: YOU'RE HATEFUL BOTH OF YOU.

INEZ: HATEFUL? YES THAT'S THE WORD. NOW GET ON WITH IT. THAT FELLOW WHO KILLED HIMSELF ON YOUR ACCOUNT— YOU WERE HIS MISTRESS EH?

GARCIN: OF COURSE SHE WAS. AND HE WANTED TO HAVE HER TO HIMSELF ALONE. THAT'S SO ISN'T IT?

INEZ: HE DANCED THE TANGO LIKE A PROFESSIONAL BUT HE WAS POOR AS A CHURCH MOUSE-THAT'S RIGHT ISN'T IT?

GARCIN: WAS HE POOR OR NOT? GIVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER. ESTELLE: YES HE WAS POOR.

GARCIN: AND THEN YOU HAD YOUR REPUTATION TO KEEP UP. ONE DAY HE CAME AND IMPLORED YOU TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM AND YOU LAUGHED IN HIS FACE.

INEZ: THAT'S IT. YOU LAUGHED AT HIM. AND SO HE KILLED HIMSELF. ESTELLE: DID YOU USE TO LOOK AT FLORENCE IN THAT WAY?

INEZ: YES.

ESTELLE: YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG YOU TWO. HE WANTED ME TO HAVE A BABY. SO THERE!

GARCIN: AND YOU DIDN'T WANT ONE?

ESTELLE: I CERTAINLY DIDN'T. BUT THE BABY CAME WORSE LUCK. I WENT TO SWITZERLAND FOR FIVE MONTHS. NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING. IT WAS A GIRL. ROGER WAS WITH ME WHEN SHE WAS BORN. IT PLEASED HIM NO END HAVING A DAUGHTER. IT DIDN'T PLEASE ME!

GARCIN: AND THEN?

ESTELLE: THERE WAS A BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE LAKE. I BROUGHT A BIG STONE. HE COULD SEE WHAT I WAS UP TO AND HE KEPT ON SHOUTING: "ESTELLE FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T!" I HATED HIM THEN. HE SAW IT ALL. HE WAS LEANING OVER THE BALCONY AND HE SAW THE RINGS SPREADING ON THE WATER—

GARCIN: YES? AND THEN?

ESTELLE: THAT'S ALL. I CAME BACK TO PARIS— AND HE DID AS HE WISHED.

GARCIN: YOU MEAN HE BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT?

ESTELLE: IT WAS ABSURD OF HIM REALLY MY HUSBAND NEVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING. OH HOW I LOATHE YOU!

GARCIN: NOTHING DOING. TEARS DON'T FLOW IN THIS PLACE.

ESTELLE: I'M A COWARD. A COWARD! IF YOU KNEW HOW I HATE YOU!

INEZ: POOR CHILD! SO THE HEARING'S OVER. BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO LOOK LIKE A HANGING JUDGE.

GARCIN: A HANGING JUDGE? I'D GIVE A LOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE MYSELF IN A GLASS. HOW HOT IT IS! (TAKES OFF COAT.) OH SORRY! (PUTS IT ON AGAIN.)

ESTELLE: DON'T BOTHER. YOU CAN STAY IN YOUR SHIRT-SLEEVES. AS THINGS ARE-

GARCIN: JUST SO. YOU MUSTN'T BE ANGRY WITH ME ESTELLE.

ESTELLE: I'M NOT ANGRY WITH YOU.

INEZ: AND WHAT ABOUT ME? ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME?

ESTELLE: YES.

INEZ: WELL MR. GARCIN NOW YOU HAVE US IN THE NUDE ALL RIGHT. DO YOUR UNDERSTAND THINGS ANY BETTER FOR THAT?

GARCIN: I WONDER. YES PERHAPS A TRIFLE BETTER. AND NOW I SUPPOSE WE START TRYING TO HELP EACH OTHER.

INEZ: I DON'T NEED HELP.

GARCIN: INEZ THEY'VE LAID THEIR SNARE DAMNED CUNNINGLY— LIKE A COBWEB. IF YOU MAKE ANY MOVEMENT IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND TO FAN YOURSELF ESTELLE AND I FEEL A LITTLE TUG. ALONE NONE OF US CAN SAVE HIMSELF OR HERSELF; WE'RE LINKED TOGETHER INEXTRICABLY. SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHOICE. HULLO? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

INEZ: THEY'VE LET IT. THE WINDOWS ARE WIDE OPEN A MAN IS SITTING ON MY BED. MY BED IF YOU PLEASE! THEY'VE LET IT LET IT! STEP IN STEP IN MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME YOU BRUTE! AH THERE'S A WOMAN TOO. SHE'S GOING UP TO HIM PUTTING HER HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS...DAMN IT WHY DON'T THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON? IT'S GETTING DARK. NOW HE'S GOING TO KISS HER. BUT THAT'S MY ROOM MY ROOM! PITCH-DARK NOW. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT I HEAR THEM WHISPERING WHISPERING. IS HE GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO HER ON MY BED? WHAT'S THAT SHE SAID? THAT IT'S NOON AND THE SUN IS SHINING? I MUST BE GOING BLIND. BLACKED OUT. I CAN'T SEE OR HEAR A THING. SO I'M DONE WITH THE EARTH IT SEEMS. NO MORE ALIBIS FOR ME! I FEEL SO EMPTY DESICCATED— REALLY DEAD AT LAST. ALL OF ME'S HERE IN THIS ROOM. WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

SOMETHING ABOUT HELPING ME WASN'T IT?

GARCIN: YES.

INEZ: HELPING ME TO DO WHAT?

GARCIN: TO DEFEAT THEIR DEVILISH TRICKS.

INEZ: AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO IN RETURN?

GARCIN: TO HELP ME. IT ONLY NEEDS A LITTLE EFFORT INEZ; JUST A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING.

INEZ: HUMAN FEELING. THAT'S BEYOND MY RANGE. I'M ROTTEN TO THE CORE.

GARCIN: AND HOW ABOUT ME? ALL THE SAME SUPPOSE WE TRY?

INEZ: IT'S NO USE. I'M ALL DRIED UP. I CAN'T GIVE AND I CAN'T RECEIVE. HOW COULD I HELP YOU? A DEAD TWIG READY FOR THE BURNING. FLORENCE WAS FAIR A NATURAL BLONDE.

GARCIN: DO YOUR REALIZE THAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S FATED TO BE YOUR TORTURER? INEZ: PERHAPS I'VE GUESSED IT.

GARCIN: IT'S THROUGH HER THEY'LL GET YOU. I OF COURSE I'M DIFFERENT— ALOOF. I TAKE NO NOTICE OF HER. SUPPOSE YOU HAD A TRY—

INEZ: YES?

GARCIN: IT'S A TRAP. THEY'RE WATCHING YOU TO SEE IF YOU'LL FALL INTO IT.

INEZ: I KNOW. AND YOU'RE ANOTHER TRAP. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVEN'T FOREKNOWN EVERY WORD YOU SAY? AND OF COURSE THERE'S A WHOLE NEST OF PITFALLS THAT WE CAN'T SEE. EVERYTHING HERE'S

A BOOBY-TRAP. BUT WHAT DO I CARE? I'M A PITFALL TOO. FOR HER OBVIOUSLY. AND PERHAPS I'LL CATCH HER.

GARCIN: YOU WON'T CATCH ANYTHING. WE'RE CHASING AFTER EACH OTHER ROUND AND ROUND IN A VICIOUS CIRCLE LIKE THE HORSES ON A ROUNDABOUT. THAT'S PART OF THEIR PLAN OF COURSE... DROP IT INEZ. OPEN YOUR HANDS AND LET GO OF EVERYTHING. OR ELSE YOU'LL BRING DISASTER ON ALL THREE OF US.

INEZ: DO I LOOK THE SORT OF PERSON WHO LETS GO? I KNOW WHAT'S COMING TO ME. I'M GOING TO BURN AND IT'S TO LAST FOREVER. YES I KNOW EVERYTHING. BUT DO YOU THINK I'LL LET GO? I'LL CATCH HER SHE'LL SEE YOU THROUGH MY EYES AS FLORENCE SAW THAT OTHER MAN. WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TRYING TO ENLIST MY SYMPATHY? I ASSURE YOU I KNOW EVERYTHING AND I CAN'T FEEL SORRY EVEN FOR MYSELF. A TRAP! DON'T I KNOW IT AND THAT I'M IN A TRAP MYSELF UP TO THE NECK AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT? AND IF IT SUITS THEIR BOOK SO MUCH THE BETTER!

GARCIN: WELL I ANYHOW CAN FEEL SORRY FOR YOU TOO. LOOK AT ME WE'RE NAKED NAKED RIGHT THROUGH AND I CAN SEE INTO YOUR HEART. THAT'S ONE LINK BETWEEN US. DO YOU THINK I'D WANT TO HURT YOU? I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING I'M DRIED UP TOO. BUT FOR YOU I CAN STILL FEEL PITY.

INEZ: DON'T. I HATE BEING PAWED ABOUT. AND KEEP YOUR PITY FOR YOURSELF. DON'T FORGET GARCIN THAT THERE ARE TRAPS FOR YOU TOO IN THIS ROOM. AL1 NICELY SET FOR YOU. YOU'D DO BETTER TO WATCH YOUR OWN INTERESTS. BUT IF YOU WILL ELAVE US IN PEACE THIS CHILD AND ME I'LL SEE I DON'T DO YOU ANY HARM.

GARCIN: VERY WELL. ESTELLE: PLEASE GARCIN. GARCIN: WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME? ESTELLE: YOU CAN HELP ME ANYHOW. GARCIN: IF YOU WANT HELP APPLY TO HER.

ESTELLE: I IMPLORE YOU GARCIN— YOU GAVE ME YOUR PROMISE DIDN'T YOU? HELP ME QUICK. I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE. OLGA'S TAKEN HIM TO A CABARET.

INEZ: TAKEN WHOM?

ESTELLE: PETER....OH NOW THEY'RE DANCING TOGETHER.

INEZ: WHO'S PETER?

ESTELLE: SUCH A SILLY BOY. HE CALLED ME HIS GLANCING STREAM— JUST FANCY! HE WAS TERRIBLY IN LOVE WITH ME... SHE'S PERSUADED HIM TO COME OUT WITH HER TONIGHT.

INEZ: DO YOU LOVE HIM?

ESTELLE: THEY'RE SITTING DOWN NOW. SHE'S PUFFING LIKE A GRAMPUS. WHAT A FOOL THE GIRL IS TO INSIST ON DANCING! BUT I DARE SAY SHE DOES IT TO REDUCE...NO OF COURSE I DON'T LOVE HIM. HE'S ONLY EIGHTEEN AND I'M NOT A BABY-SNATCHER.

INEZ: THEN WHY BOTHER ABOUT THEM? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

ESTELLE: HE BELONGED TO ME.

INEZ: NOTHING ON EARTH BELONGS TO YOU ANY MORE.

ESTELLE: I TELL YOU HE WAS MINE. ALL MINE.

INEZ: YES HE WAS YOURS— ONCE. BUT NOW—TRY TO MAKE HIM HEAR TRY TO TOUCH HIM. OLGA CAN TOUCH HIM TALK TO HIM AS MUCH AS SHE LIKES. THAT'S SO ISN'T IT? SHE CAN SQUEEZE HIS HANDS RUB HERSELF AGAINST HIM—

ESTELLE: YES LOOK! SHE'S PRESSING HER GREAT FAT CHEST AGAINST HIM PUFFING AND BLOWING HIS HIS FACE. BUT MY POOR LITTLE LAMB CAN'T YOU SEE HOW RIDICULOUS SHE IS? WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH AT HER? OH ONCE I'D HAVE ONLY HAD TO GLANCE AT THEM AND SHE'D HAVE SLUNK AWAY. IS THERE REALLY NOTHING NOTHING LEFT OF ME?

INEZ: NOTHING WHATEVER. NOTHING OF YOU'S LEFT ON EARTH— NOT EVEN A SHADOW. ALL YOU OWN IS HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT PAPER-KNIFE? OR THAT ORNAMENT ON THE MANTELPIECE? THAT BLUE SOFA'S YOURS. AND I MY DEAR AM YOURS FOREVER.

ESTELLE: YOU MINE! THAT'S GOOD! WELL WHICH OF YOU TWO WOULD DARE TO CALL ME HIS GLANCING STREAM HIS CRYSTAL GIRL? YOU KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT ME YOU KNOW I'M ROTTEN THROUGH AND THROUGH... PETER DEAR THINK OF ME FIX YOUR THOUGHTS ON ME AND SAVE ME. ALL THE TIME YOU'RE THINKING "MY GLANCING STREAM HIS CRYSTAL GIRL" I'M ONLY HALF HERE. I'M ONLY HALF WICKED AND HALF OF ME IS DOWN THERE WITH YOU CLEAN AND BRIGHT AND CRYSTAL-CLEAR AS RUNNING WATER...OH JUST LOOK AT HER FACE ALL SCARLET LIKE A TOMATO. NO IT'S ABSURD WE'VE LAUGHED AT HER TOGETHER YOU AND I OFTEN AND OFTEN... WHAT'S THAT TUNE? — I ALWAYS LOVED IT. YES THE "ST. LOUIS BLUES"....ALL RIGHT DANCE AWAY DANCE AWAY. GARCIN I WISH YOU COULD SEE HER YOU'D DIE OF LAUGHING.ONLY—SHE'LL NEVER KNOW I SEE HER. YES I SEE YOU OLGA WITH YOUR HAIR ALL ANYHOW AND YOU DO LOOK LIKE A DOPE MY DEAR. OH NOW YOU'RE TREADING ON HIS TOES. IT'S A SCREAM! HURRY UP! QUICKER! QUICKER! HE'S DRAGGING HER ALONG BUNDLING HER ROUND AND ROUND— IT'S TOO GHASTLY! HE ALWAYS SAID I WAS SO LIGHT HE LOVED TO DANCE WITH ME. I TELL YOU OLGA I CAN SEE YOU. NO SHE DOESN'T CARE SHE'S DANCING THROUGH MY GAZE. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID? "OUR POOR DEAR ESTELLE"? OH DON'T BE SUCH A HUMBUG! YOU DIDN'T EVEN SHED A TEAR AT THE FUNERAL...AND SHE HAS THE NERVE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HER POOR DEAR FRIEND ESTELLE! HOW DARE SHE DISCUSS ME WITH PETER? NOW THEN KEEP TIME. SHE NEVER COULD DANCE AND TALK AT ONCE. OH WHAT'S THAT? NO NO. DON'T TELL HIM. PLEASE PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM. YOU CAN KEEP HIM DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH HIM BUT PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM ABOUT— THAT! ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN HAVE HIM NOW. ISN'T IT FOUL GARCIN? SHE'S TOLD HIM EVERYTHING ABOUT ROGER MY TRIP TO SWITZERLAND THE BABY. "POOR ESTELLE WASN'T EXACTLY—" "NO I WASN'T EXACTLY— TRUE ENOUGH. HE'S LOOKING GRAVE SHAKING HIS HEAD BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM SO MUCH SURPRISED NOT WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT. KEEP HIM THEN— I WON'T HAGGLE WITH YOU OVER HIS LONG EYELASHES HIS PRETTY GIRLISH FACE. THEY'RE YOURS FOR THE ASKING. HIS GLANCING STREAM HIS CRYSTAL. WELL THE CRYSTAL'S SHATTERED INTO BITS. "POOR ESTELLE!" DANCE DANCE DANCE. ON WITH IT. BUT DO KEEP TIME. ONE TWO. ONE TWO. HOW I'D LOVE TO GO DOWN TO EARTH FOR JUST A MOMENT AND DANCE WITH HIM AGAIN. THE MUSIC'S GROWING FAINTER. THEY'VE TURNED DOWN THE LIGHTS AS THEY DO FOR A TANGO. WHY ARE THEY PLAYING SO SOFTLY? LOUDER PLEASE. I CAN'T HEAR. IT'S SO FAR AWAY SO FAR AWAY. I—I CAN'T HEAR A SOUND. ALL OVER. IT'S THE END. THE EARTH HAS LEFT ME. DON'T TURN FROM ME— PLEASE. TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS.

INEZ: NOW THEN GARCIN!

GARCIN: IT'S TO HER YOU SHOULD SAY THAT.

ESTELLE: DON'T TURN AWAY. YOU'RE A MAN AREN'T YOU AND SURELY I'M NOT A FRIGHT AS ALL THAT! EVERYONE SAYS I'VE LOVELY HAIR AND AFTER ALL A MAN KILLED HIMSELF ON MY ACCOUNT. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING AND THERE'S NOTHING HERE TO SEE EXCEPT THE SOFAS AND THAT

AWFUL ORNAMENT AND THE TABLE. SURELY I'M BETTER TO LOOK AT THAT AN LOT OF STUPID FURNITURE. LISTEN! I'VE DROPPED OUT OF THEIR HEART LIKE A LITTLE SPARROW FALLEN FROM ITS NEST. SO GATHER ME UP DEAR FOLD ME TO YOUR HEART—AND YOU'LL SEE HOW NICE I CAN BE.

GARCIN: I TELL YOU IT'S TO THAT LADY YOU SHOULD SPEAK. ESTELLE: TO HER? BUT SHE DOESN'T COUNT SHE'S A WOMAN.

INEZ: OH I DON'T COUNT? IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? BUT MY POOR LITTLE FALLEN NESTLING YOU'VE BEEN SHELTERING IN MY HEART FOR AGES THOUGH YOU DIDN'T REALIZE IT. DON'T BE AFRAID; I'LL KEEP LOOKING AT YOU FOR EVER AND EVER WITHOUT A FLUTTER OF MY EYELIDS AND YOU'LL LIVE IN MY GAZE LIKE A MOTE IN A SUNBEAM.

ESTELLE: A SUNBEAM INDEED! DON'T TALK SUCH RUBBISH! YOU'VE TRIED THAT TRICK ALREADY AND YOU SHOULD KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK.

INEZ: ESTELLE! MY GLANCING STREAM! MY CRYSTAL!

ESTELLE: YOUR CRYSTAL? IT'S GROTESQUE. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FOOL ME WITH THAT SORT OF TALK? EVERYONE KNOW BY NOW WHAT I DID TO MY BABY. THE CRYSTAL'S SHATTERED BUT I DON'T CARE. I'M JUST A HOLLOW DUMMY ALL THAT'S LEFT OF ME IS THE OUTSIDE—BUT IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

INEZ: COME TO ME ESTELLE. YOU SHALL BE WHATEVER YOU LIKE: A GLANCING STREAM A MUDDY STREAM. AND DEEP DOWN IN MY EYES YOU'LL SEE YOURSELF JUST AS YOU WANT TO BE.

ESTELLE: OH LEAVE ME IN PEACE. YOU HAVEN'T ANY EYES. OH DAMN IT ISN'T THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO GET RID OF YOU? I'VE AN IDEA. (SPITS IN GARCIN'S FACE.) THERE!

INEZ: GARCIN YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS. GARCIN: SO IT'S A MAN YOU NEED? ESTELLE: NOT ANY MAN. YOU.

GARCIN: NO HUMBUG NOW. ANY MAN WOULD DO YOUR BUSINESS. AS I HAPPEN TO BE HERE YOU WANT ME. RIGHT! MIND I'M NOT YOUR SORT AT ALL REALLY; I'M NOT A YOUNG NINCOMPOOP AND I DON'T DANCE THE TANGO.

ESTELLE: I'LL TAKE YOU AS YOU ARE. AND PERHAPS I SHALL CHANGE YOU.

GARCIN: I DOUBT IT. I SHAN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION; I'VE OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

ESTELLE: WHAT THINGS?

GARCIN: THEY WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU.

ESTELLE: I'LL SIT ON YOUR SOFA AND WAIT FOR YOU TO TAKE SOME NOTICE OF ME. I PROMISE NOT TO BOTHER YOU AT ALL.

INEZ: THAT'S RIGHT FAWN ON HIM LIKE THE SILLY BITCH YOU ARE. GROVEL AND CRINGE! AND HE HASN'T EVEN GOOD LOOKS TO COMMEND HIM!

ESTELLE: DON'T LISTEN TO HER. SHE HAS NO EYES NO EARS. SHE'S— NOTHING.

GARCIN: I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT I CAN. IT DOESN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH. I SHAN'T LOVE YOU; I KNOW YOU TOO WELL.

ESTELLE: DO YOU WANT ME ANYHOW?

GARCIN: YES.

ESTELLE: I ASK NO MORE.

GARCIN: IN THAT CASE-

INEZ: ESTELLE! GARCIN! YOU MUST BE GOING CRAZY. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. I'M HERE TOO.

GARCIN: OF COURSE- BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER? INEZ: UNDER MY EYES? YOU COULDN'T— COULDN'T DO IT. ESTELLE: WHY NOT? I OFTEN UNDRESSED WITH MY MAID LOOKING ON. INEZ: LET HER ALONE. DON'T PAW HER WITH YOUR DIRTY MAN'S HANDS.

GARCIN: TAKE CARE. I'M NO GENTLEMAN AND I'D HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT STRIKING A WOMAN.

INEZ: BUT YOU PROMISED ME; YOU PROMISED. I'M ONLY ASKING YOU TO KEEP YOUR WORD. GARCIN: WHY SHOULD I CONSIDERING YOU WERE THE FIRST TO BREAK OUR AGREEMENT?

INEZ: VERY WELL HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY. I'M THE WEAKER PARTY ONE AGAINST TWO. BUT DON'T FORGET I'M HERE AND WATCHING. I SHAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU GARCIN; WHEN YOU'RE KISSING HER YOU'LL FEEL THEM BORING INTO YOU. YES HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY MAKE LOVE AND GET IT OVER. WE'RE IN HELL; MY TURN WILL COME.

GARCIN: NOW THEN. YOUR LIPS. GIVE ME YOUR LIPS. ESTELLE: REALLY! DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER?

GARCIN: YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG. IT'S GOMEZ; HE'S BACK IN THE PRESS-ROOM. THEY'VE SHUT THE WINDOWS; IT MUST BE WINTER DOWN THERE. SIX MONTHS SINCE I—WELL I WARNED YOU I'D BE ABSENT-MINDED SOMETIMES DIDN'T I? THEY'RE SHIVERING THEY'VE KEPT THEIR COATS ON. FUNNY THEY SHOULD FEEL THE COLD LIKE THAT WHEN I'M FEELING SO HOT. AH THIS TIME HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

ESTELLE: IS IT GOING TO LAST LONG? YOU MIGHT AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT HE'S SAYING.

GARCIN: NOTHING. NOTHING WORTH REPEATING. HE'S A SWINE THAT'S ALL. A GOD-DAMNED BLOODY SWINE. LET'S COME BACK TO— TO OURSELVES. ARE YOU GOING TO LOVE ME?

ESTELLE: I WONDER NOW!

GARCIN: WILL YOU TRUST ME?

ESTELLE: WHAT A QUAINT THING TO ASK! CONSIDERING YOU'LL BE UNDER MY EYES ALL THE TIME AND I DON'T THINK I'VE MUCH TO FEAR FROM INEZ SO FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED.

GARCIN: OBVIOUSLY. I WAS THINKING OF ANOTHER KIND OF TRUST. TALK AWAY TALK AWAY YOU SWINE. I'M NOT THERE TO DEFEND MYSELF. ESTELLE YOU MUST GIVE ME YOUR TRUST.

ESTELLE: OH WHAT A NUISANCE YOU ARE! I'M GIVING YOU MY MOUTH MY ARMS MY WHOLE BODY— AND EVERYTHING COULD BE SO SIMPLE...MY TRUST! I HAVEN'T ANY TO GIVE I'M AFRAID AND YOU'RE MAKING ME TERRIBLY EMBARRASSED. YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING PRETTY GHASTLY ON YOUR CONSCIENCE TO MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT MY TRUSTING YOU.

GARCIN: THEY SHOT ME.

ESTELLE: I KNOW. BECAUSE YOU REFUSED TO FIGHT. WELL WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?

GARCIN: I—I DIDN'T EXACTLY REFUSE. I MUST SAY HE TALKS WELL HE MAKES OUT A GOOD CASE AGAINST ME BUT HE NEVER SAYS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE INSTEAD. SHOULD I HAVE GONE TO THE GENERAL AND SAID: "GENERAL I DECLINE TO FIGHT"? A MUG'S GAME; THEY'D HAVE PROMPTLY LOCKED ME UP. BUT I WANTED TO SHOW MY COLORS MY TRUE COLORS DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I WASN'T GOING TO BE SILENCED. SO I—I TOOK THE TRAIN.... THEY CAUGHT ME AT THE FRONTIER.

ESTELLE: WHERE WERE YOU TRYING TO GO?

GARCIN: TO MEXICO. I MEANT TO LAUNCH A PACIFIST NEWSPAPER DOWN THERE. WELL WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK?

ESTELLE: WHAT COULD I SAY? YOU ACTED QUITE RIGHTLY AS YOU DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT. BUT DARLING HOW ON EARTH CAN I GUESS WHAT YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER?

INEZ: CAN'T YOU GUESS? WELL I CAN. HE WANTS YOU TO TELL HIM THAT HE BOLTED LIKE A LION. FOR "BOLT" HE DID AND THAT'S WHAT BITING HIM.

GARCIN: "BOLTED" "WENT AWAY"— WE WON'T QUARREL OVER WORDS.

ESTELLE: BUT YOU HAD TO RUN AWAY. IF YOU'D STAYED THEY'D HAVE SENT YOU TO JAIL WOULDN'T THEY?

GARCIN: OF COURSE. WELL ESTELLE AM I A COWARD?

ESTELLE: HOW CAN I SAY? DON'T BE SO UNREASONABLE DARLING. I CAN'T PUT MYSELF IN YOUR SKIN. YOU MUST DECIDE THAT FOR YOURSELF.

GARCIN: I CAN'T DECIDE.

ESTELLE: ANYWAY YOU MUST REMEMBER. YOU MUST HAVE HAD REASONS FOR ACTING AS YOU DID.

GARCIN: I HAD.

ESTELLE: WELL?

GARCIN: BUT WERE THEY THE REAL REASONS?

ESTELLE: YOU'VE A TWISTED MIND THAT'S YOUR TROUBLE. PLAGUING YOURSELF OVER SUCH TRIFLES!

GARCIN: I'D THOUGHT IT ALL OUT AND I WANTED TO MAKE A STAND. BUT WAS THAT MY REAL MOTIVE?

INEZ: EXACTLY. THAT'S THE QUESTION. WAS THAT YOUR REAL MOTIVE? NO DOUBT YOU ARGUED IT OUT WITH YOURSELF YOU WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS YOU FOUND GOOD REASONS FOR WHAT YOU DID. BUT FEAR AND HATRED AND ALL THE DIRTY LITTLE INSTINCTS ONE KEEPS DARK— THEY'RE MOTIVES TOO. SO CARRY ON MR. GARCIN AND TRY TO BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF— FOR ONCE.

GARCIN: DO I REALLY NEED YOU TO TELL ME THAT? DAY AND NIGHT I PACED MY CELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE DOOR FROM THE DOOR TO THE WINDOW. I PRIED INTO MY HEART I SLEUTHED MYSELF

LIKE A DETECTIVE. BY THE END OF IT I FELT AS IF I'D GIVEN MY WHOLE LIFE TO INTROSPECTION. BUT ALWAYS I HARKED BACK TO THE ONE THING CERTAIN— THAT I HAD ACTED AS I DID I'D TAKEN THAT TRAIN TO THE FRONTIER. BUT WHY? WHY?FINALLY I THOUGHT: MY DEATH WILL SETTLE IT. IF I FACE DEATH COURAGEOUSLY I'LL PROVE I AM NO COWARD.

INEZ: AND HOW DID YOU FACE DEATH?

GARCIN: MISERABLY. ROTTENLY. OH IT WAS ONLY A PHYSICAL LAPSE— THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ANYONE; I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT. ONLY EVERYTHING'S BEEN LEFT IN SUSPENSE FOREVER. COME HERE ESTELLE. LOOK AT ME. I WANT TO FEEL SOMEONE LOOKING AT ME WHILE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME ON EARTH... I LIKE GREEN EYES.

INEZ: GREEN EYES! JUST HARK TO HIM! AND YOU ESTELLE DO YOU LIKE COWARDS?

ESTELLE: IF YOU KNEW HOW LITTLE I CARE! COWARD OR HERO IT'S ALL ONE— PROVIDED HE KISSES WELL.

GARCIN: THERE THEY ARE SLUMPED IN THEIR CHAIRS SUCKING AT THEIR CIGARS. BORED THEY LOOK. HALF-ASLEEP. THEY'RE THINKING:"GARCIN'S A COWARD." BUT ONLY VAGUELY DREAMILY. ONE'S GOT TO THINK OF SOMETHING. "THAT CHAP GARCIN WAS A COWARD." THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DECIDED THOSE DEAR FRIENDS OF MINE. IN SIX MONTHS'TIME THEY'LL BE SAYING: "COWARDLY AS THAT SKUNK GARCIN." YOU'RE LUCKY YOU TWO; NO ONE ON EARTH IS GIVING YOU ANOTHER THOUGHT. BUT I—I'M LONG IN DYING.

INEZ: WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE GARCIN?

GARCIN: OH DIDN'T I TELL YOU? SHE'S DEAD.

INEZ: DEAD?

GARCIN: YES SHE DIED JUST NOW. ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.

INEZ: OF GRIEF?

GARCIN: WHAT ELSE SHOULD SHE DIE OF? SO ALL IS FOR THE BEST YOU SEE; THE WAR'S OVER MY WIFE'S DEAD AND I'VE CARVED OUT MY PLACE IN HISTORY.

ESTELLE: MY POOR DARLING! LOOK AT ME. PLEASE LOOK. TOUCH ME. TOUCH ME. THERE! KEEP YOUR HAND THERE. NO DON'T MOVE. WHY TROUBLE WHAT THOSE MEN ARE THINKING? THEY'LL DIE OFF ONE BY ONE. FORGET THEM. THERE'S ONLY ME NOW.

GARCIN: BUT THEY WON'T FORGET ME NOT THEY! THEY'LL DIE BUT OTHERS WILL COME AFTER THEM TO CARRY ON THE LEGEND. I'VE LEFT MY FATE IN THEIR HANDS.

ESTELLE: YOU THINK TOO MUCH THAT'S YOUR TROUBLE.

GARCIN: WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO NOW? I WAS A MAN OF ACTION ONCE... OH IF ONLY I COULD BE WITH THEM AGAIN FOR JUST ONE DAY—I'D FLING THEIR LIE IN THEIR TEETH. BUT I'M LOCKED OUT; THEY'RE PASSING JUDGMENT ON MY LIFE WITHOUT TROUBLING ABOUT ME AND THEY'RE RIGHT BECAUSE I'M DEAD. DEAD AND DONE WITH. A BACK NUMBER.

ESTELLE: GARCIN.

GARCIN: STILL THERE? NOW LISTEN! I WANT YOU TO DO ME A SERVICE. NO DON'T SHRINK AWAY. I KNOW IT MUST SEEM STRANGE TO YOU HAVING SOMEONE ASKING YOU FOR HELP; YOU'RE NOT USED TO THAT. BUT IF YOU'LL MAKE THE EFFORT IF YOU'LL ONLY WILL IT HARD ENOUGH I DARE SAY WE CAN REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. A THOUSAND OF THEM ARE PROCLAIMING I'M A COWARD; BUT WHAT DO NUMBERS MATTER? IF THERE'S SOMEONE JUST ONE PERSON TO SAY QUITE POSITIVELY I DID NOT RUN AWAY THAT I'M NOT THE SORT WHO RUNS AWAY THAT I'M BRAVE AND DECENT AND THE REST OF IT— WELL THAT ONE PERSON'S FAITH WOULD SAVE ME. WILL YOU HAVE THAT FAITH IN ME? THEN I SHALL LOVE YOU AND CHERISH YOU FOR EVER. ESTELLE— WILL YOU?

ESTELLE: OH YOU DEAR SILLY MAN DO YOU THINK I COULD LOVE A COWARD? GARCIN: BUT JUST NOW YOU SAID-

ESTELLE: I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU. I LIKE MEN MY DEAR WHO'RE REAL MEN WITH TOUGH SKIN AND STRONG HANDS. YOU HAVEN'T A COWARD'S CHIN OR A COWARD'S MOUTH OR A COWARD'S VOICE OR A COWARD'S HAIR. AND IT'S FOR YOUR MOUTH YOUR HAIR YOUR VOICE I LOVE.

GARCIN: DO YOU MEAN THIS? REALLY MEAN IT?

ESTELLE: SHALL I SWEAR IT?

GARCIN: THEN I SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM ALL THOSE BELOW AND THOSE IN HERE. ESTELLE WE SHALL CLIMB OUT OF HELL. (INEZ LAUGHS.) WHAT'S THAT?

INEZ: BUT SHE DOESN'T MEAN A WORD OF WHAT SHE SAYS. HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A SIMPLETON? "ESTELLE AM I A COWARD?" AS IF SHE CARED A DAMN EITHER WAY.

ESTELLE: INEZ HOW DARE YOU? DON'T LISTEN TO HER. IF YOU WANT ME TO HAVE FAITH IN YOU YOU MUST BEGIN BY TRUSTING ME.

INEZ: THAT'S RIGHT! THAT'S RIGHT! TRUST AWAY! SHE WANTS A MAN— THAT FAR YOU CAN TRUST HER-- SHE WANTS A MAN'S ARM ROUND HER WAIST A MAN'S SMELL A MAN'S EYES GLOWING WITH DESIRE. AND THAT'S ALL SHE WANTS. SHE'D ASSURE YOU YOU WERE GOD ALMIGHTY IF SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD GIVE YOU PLEASURE.

GARCIN: ESTELLE IS IT TRUE? ANSWER ME. IS IT TRUE?

ESTELLE: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY? DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW MADDENING IT IS TO HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ONE CAN'T MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF? YOU DO MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT...ANYHOW I'D LOVE YOU JUST THE SAME EVEN IF YOU WERE A COWARD. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

GARCIN: YOU DISGUST ME BOTH OF YOU. ESTELLE: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? GARCIN: I'M GOING.

INEZ: YOU WON'T GET FAR. THE DOOR IS LOCKED. GARCIN: I'LL MAKE THEM OPEN IT.

ESTELLE: PLEASE! PLEASE!

INEZ: DON'T WORRY MY PET. THE BELL DOESN'T WORK.

GARCIN: I TELL YOU THEY SHALL OPEN. I CAN'T ENDURE IT ANY LONGER I'M THROUGH WITH YOU BOTH. GO AWAY.(TO ESTELLE) YOU'RE EVEN FOULER THAN SHE. I WON'T LET MYSELF GET BOGGED IN YOUR EYES. YOU'RE SOFT AND SLIMY. UGH! LIKE AN OCTOPUS. LIKE A QUAGMIRE.

ESTELLE: I BEG YOU OH I BEG YOU NOT TO LEAVE ME. I'LL PROMISE NOT TO SPEAK AGAIN I WON'T TROUBLE YOU IN ANY WAY— BUT DON'T GO. I DAREN'T BE LEFT ALONE WITH INEZ NOW SHE'S SHOWN HER CLAWS.

GARCIN: LOOK AFTER YOURSELF. I NEVER ASKED YOU TO COME HERE. ESTELLE: OH HOW MEAN YOU ARE! YES IT'S QUITE TRUE YOU'RE A COWARD.

INEZ: WELL MY LITTLE SPARROW FALLEN FROM THE NEST I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED NOW. YOU SPAT IN MY FACE— PLAYING UP TO HIM OF COURSE— AND WE HAD A TIFF ON HIS ACCOUNT. BUT HE'S GOING AND A GOOD RIDDANCE IT WILL BE. WE TWO WOMEN WILL HAVE THE PLACE TO OURSELVES.

ESTELLE: YOU WON'T GAIN ANYTHING. IF THAT DOOR OPENS I'M GOING TOO.

INEZ: WHERE?

ESTELLE: I DON'T CARE WHERE. AS FAR FROM YOU AS I CAN.

GARCIN: OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN BLAST YOU! I'LL ENDURE ANYTHING YOUR RED-HOT TONGS AND MOLTEN LEAD YOUR RACKS AND PRONGS AND GARROTES— ALL YOUR FIENDISH GADGETS EVERYTHING THAT BURNS AND FLAYS AND TEARS— I'LL PUT UP WITH ANY TORTURE YOU IMPOSE. ANYTHING ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS AGONY OF MIND THIS CREEPING PAIN THAT GNAWS AND FUMBLES AND CARESSES ONE AND NEVER HURTS QUITE ENOUGH. NOW WILL YOU OPEN? (THE DOOR FLIES OPEN: A LONG SILENCE.)

INEZ: WELL GARCIN? YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

GARCIN: NOW I WONDER WHY THAT DOOR OPENED. INEZ: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? HURRY UP AND GO. GARCIN: I SHALL NOT GO.

INEZ: AND YOU ESTELLE? SO WHAT? WHICH SHALL IT BE? WHICH OF THE THREE OF US WILL LEAVE? THE BARRIER'S DOWN WHY ARE WE WAITING? BUT WHAT A SITUATION! IT'S A SCREAM! WE'RE INSEPARABLES!

ESTELLE: INSEPARABLES? GARCIN COME AND LEND A HAND. QUICKLY. WE'LL PUSH HER OUT AND SLAM THE DOOR ON HER. THAT'LL TEACH HER A LESSON.

INEZ:(STRUGGLING WITH INEZ) ESTELLE I BEG YOU LET ME STAY. I WON'T GO I WON'T GO! NOT INTO THE PASSAGE.

GARCIN: LET GO OF HER.

ESTELLE: YOU'RE CRAZY. SHE HATES YOU.

GARCIN: IT'S BECAUSE OF HER I'M STAYING HERE.

INEZ: BECAUSE OF ME? ALL RIGHT SHUT THE DOOR. IT'S TEN TIMES HOTTER HERE SINCE IT OPENED. BECAUSE OF ME YOU SAID?

GARCIN: YES. YOU ANYHOW KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A COWARD. INEZ: YES I KNOW.

GARCIN: AND YOU KNOW WHAT WICKEDNESS IS AND SHAME AND FEAR. THERE WERE DAYS WHEN YOU PEERED INTO YOURSELF INTO THE SECRET PLACES OF YOUR HEART AND WHAT YOU SAW THERE MADE YOU FAINT WITH HORROR. AND THEN NEXT DAY YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT YOU COULDN'T INTERPRET THE HORROR YOU HAD GLIMPSED THE DAY BEFORE. YES YOU KNOW WHAT EVIL COSTS. AND WHEN YOU SAY I'M A COWARD YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE WHAT THAT MEANS.

IS THAT SO?

INEZ: YES.

GARCIN: SO IT'S YOU WHOM I HAVE TO CONVINCE; YOU ARE OF MY KIND. DID YOU SUPPOSE I MEANT TO GO? NO I COULDN'T LEAVE YOU HERE GLOATING OVER MY DEFEAT WITH ALL THOSE THOUGHTS ABOUT ME RUNNING IN YOUR HEAD.

INEZ: DO YOU REALLY WISH TO CONVINCE ME?

GARCIN: THAT'S THE ONE AND ONLY THING I WISH FOR NOW. I CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER YOU KNOW. PROBABLY THAT MEANS THEY'RE THROUGH WITH ME. FOR GOOD AND ALL. THE CURTAIN'S DOWN NOTHING OF ME IS LEFT ON EARTH— NOT EVEN THE NAME OF COWARD. SO INEZ WE'RE ALONE. ONLY YOU TWO REMAIN TO GIVE A THOUGHT TO ME. SHE- SHE DOESN'T COUNT. IT'S YOU WHO MATTER; YOU WHO HATE ME. IF YOU'LL HAVE FAITH IN ME I'M SAVED.

INEZ: IT WON'T BE EASY. HAVE A LOOK AT ME. I'M A HARD-HEADED WOMAN. GARCIN: I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE TIME THAT'S NEEDED. INEZ: YES WE'VE LOTS OF TIME IN HAND. ALL TIME.

GARCIN: LISTEN! EACH MAN HAS AN AIM IN LIFE A LEADING MOTIVE; THAT'S SO ISN'T IT? WELL I DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN FOR WEALTH OR FOR LOVE. I AIMED AT BEING A REAL MAN. A TOUGH AS THEY SAY. I STAKED EVERYTHING ON THE SAME HORSE... CAN ONE POSSIBLY BE A COWARD WHEN ONE'S DELIBERATELY COURTED DANGER AT EVERY TURN? AND CAN JUDGE A LIFE BY A SINGLE ACTION?

INEZ: WHY NOT? FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU DREAMT YOU WERE A HERO AND CONDONED A THOUSAND PETTY LAPSES—BECAUSE A HERO OF COURSE CAN DO NO WRONG. AN EASY METHOD OBVIOUSLY. THEN A DAY CAME WHEN YOU WERE UP AGAINST IT THE RED LIGHT OF REAL DANGER— AND YOU TOOK THE TRAIN TO MEXICO.

GARCIN: I "DREAMT" YOU SAY. IT WAS NO DREAM. WHEN I CHOSE THE HARDEST PATH I MADE MY CHOICE DELIBERATELY. A MAN IS WHAT HE WILLS HIMSELF TO BE.

INEZ: PROVE IT. PROVE IT WAS NO DREAM. IT'S WHAT ONE DOES AND NOTHING ELSE THAT SHOWS THE STUFF ONE'S MADE OF.

GARCIN: I DIED TOO SOON. I WASN'T ALLOWED TIME TO—TO DO MY DEEDS.

INEZ: ONE ALWAYS DIES TOO SOON— OR TOO LATE. AND YET ONE'S WHOLE LIFE IS COMPLETE AT THAT MOMENT WITH A LINE DRAWN NEATLY UNDER IT READY FOR THE SUMMING UP. YOU ARE— YOUR LIFE AND NOTHING ELSE.

GARCIN: WHAT A POISONOUS WOMAN YOU ARE! WITH AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.

INEZ: NOW THEN! DON'T LOSE HEART. IT SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD CONVINCING ME. PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER  MAN RAKE UP SOME ARGUMENTS. AH WASN'T I RIGHT WHEN I SAID YOU WERE VULNERABLE? NOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THE PRICE AND WHAT A PRICE! YOU'RE A COWARD GARCIN BECAUSE I WISH IT! I WISH IT— DO YOU HEAR?--1 WISH IT. AND YET JUST LOOK AT ME SEE HOW WEAK I AM A MERE BREATH ON THE AIR A GAZE OBSERVING YOU A FORMLESS THOUGHT THAT THINKS YOU. AH THEY'RE OPEN NOW THOSE BIG HANDS THOSE COARSE MAN'S HANDS! BUT WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO DO? YOU CAN'T THROTTLE THOUGHTS WITH HANDS. SO YOU'VE NO CHOICE YOU MUST CONVINCE ME AND YOU'RE AT MY MERCY.

ESTELLE: GARCIN!

GARCIN: WHAT?

ESTELLE: REVENGE YOURSELF.

GARCIN: HOW?

ESTELLE: KISS ME DARLING—THEN YOU'LL HEAR HER SQUEAL.

GARCIN: THAT'S TRUE INEZ. I'M AT YOUR MERCY BUT YOU'RE AT MINE AS WELL.

INEZ: OH YOU COWARD YOU WEAKLING RUNNING TO WOMEN TO CONSOLE YOU!

ESTELLE: THAT'S RIGHT INEZ. SQUEAL AWAY.

INEZ: WHAT A LOVELY PAIR YOU MAKE! IF YOU COULD SEE HIS BIG PAW SPLAYED OUT ON YOUR BACK RUCKING UP YOUR SKIN AND CREASING THE SILK. BE CAREFUL THOUGH! HE'S PERSPIRING HIS HAND WILL LEAVE A BLUE STAIN ON YOUR DRESS.

ESTELLE: SQUEAL AWAY INEZ SQUEAL AWAY!...HUG ME TIGHT DARLING; TIGHTER STILL—THAT'LL FINISH HER OFF AND A GOOD THING TOO!

INEZ: YES GARCIN SHE'S RIGHT. CARRY ON WITH IT PRESS HER TO YOU TILL YOU FEEL YOUR BODIES MELTING INTO EACH OTHER; A LUMP OF WARM THROBBING FLESH... LOE'S A GRAND SOLACE ISN'T IT MY FRIEND? DEEP AND DARK AS SLEEP. BUT I'LL SEE YOU DON'T SLEEP.

ESTELLE: DON'T LISTEN TO HER. PRESS YOUR LIPS TO MY MOUTH. OH I'M YOURS YOURS YOURS.

INEZ: WELL WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. WHAT A LOVELY SCENE: COWARD GARCIN HOLDING BABY-KILLER ESTELLE IN HIS MANLY ARMS! MAKE YOUR STAKES EVERYONE. WILL COWARD GARCIN KISS THE LADY OR WON'T HE DARE? WHAT'S THE BETTING? I'M WATCHING YOU EVERYBODY'S WATCHING I'M A CROWD ALL BY MYSELF. DO YOU HEAR THE CROWD? DO YOU HEAR THEM MUTTERING GARCIN? "COWARD!COWARD!" —THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...IT'S NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET FROM HER SILLY LIPS? FORGETFULNESS? BUT I SHAN'T FORGET YOU NOT I! "IT'S I YOU MUST CONVINCE." SO COME TO ME. I'M WAITING. COME ALONG NOW...LOOK HOW OBEDIENT HE IS LIKE A WELL-TRAINED DOG WHO COMES WHEN HIS MISTRESS CALLS. YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM AND YOU NEVER WILL.

GARCIN: WILL NIGHT NEVER COME?

INEZ: NEVER.

GARCIN: YOU WILL ALWAYS SEE ME?

INEZ: ALWAYS.

GARCIN: THIS BRONZE. YES NOW'S THE MOMENT; I'M LOOKING AT THIS THING ON THE MANTELPIECE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M IN HELL. I TELL YOU EVERYTHING'S BEEN THOUGHTOUT BEFOREHAND. THEY KNEW I'D STAND AT THE FIREPLACE STROKING THIS THING OF BRONZE WITH ALL THOSE EYES INTENT ON ME. DEVOURING ME. WHAT? ONLY TWO OF YOU? I THOUGHT THERE WERE

MORE; MANY MORE. SO THIS IS HELL. I'D NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT. YOU REMEMBER ALL WE WERE TOLD ABOUT THE TORTURE-CHAMBERS THE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE THE "BURNING MARL." OLD WIVES' TALES! THERE'S NO NEED FOR RED-HOT POKERS. HELL IS-OTHER PEOPLE!

ESTELLE: MY DARLING! PLEASE-

GARCIN: NO LET ME BE. SHE IS BETWEEN US. I CANNOT LOVE YOU WHEN SHE'S WATCHING.

ESTELLE: RIGHT! IN THAT CASE I'LL STOP HER WATCHING. (SHE PICKS UP THE PAPER KNIFE AND STABS INEZ SEVERAL TIMES.)

INEZ: BUT YOU CRAZY CREATURE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YOU KNOW QUITE WELL I'M DEAD.

ESTELLE: DEAD?

INEZ: DEAD! DEAD! DEAD! KNIVES POISON ROPES—USELESS. IT HAS HAPPENED ALREADY DO YOU UNDERSTAND? ONCE AND FOR ALL. SO HERE WE ARE FOREVER.

ESTELLE: FOREVER. MY GOD HOW FUNNY! FOREVER.

GARCIN: FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER. (A LONG SILENCE.)

GARCIN: WELL WELL LET'S GET ON WITH IT...


SOME WERE DREADFULLY INSULTED AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TO HAVE HELD UP AS A MODEL SUCH AN IMMORAL CHARACTER AS A HERO OF OUR TIME; OTHERS SHREWDLY NOTICED THAT THE AUTHOR HAD PORTRAYED HIMSELF AND HIS ACQUAINTANCES.… A HERO OF OUR TIME GENTLEMEN IS IN FACT A PORTRAIT BUT NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL; IT IS THE AGGREGATE OF THE VICES OF OUR WHOLE GENERATION IN THEIR FULLEST EXPRESSION.

MAY I MONSIEUR OFFER MY SERVICES WITHOUT RUNNING THE RISK OF INTRUDING? I FEAR YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE YOURSELF UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORTHY APE WHO PRESIDES OVER THE FATE OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT. IN FACT HE SPEAKS NOTHING BUT DUTCH. UNLESS YOU AUTHORIZE ME TO PLEAD YOUR CASE HE WILL NOT GUESS THAT YOU WANT GIN. THERE I DARE HOPE HE UNDERSTOOD ME; THAT NOD MUST MEAN THAT HE YIELDS TO MY ARGUMENTS. HE IS TAKING STEPS; INDEED HE IS MAKING HASTE WITH PRUDENT DELIBERATION. YOU ARE LUCKY; HE DIDN’T GRUNT. WHEN HE REFUSES TO SERVE SOMEONE HE MERELY GRUNTS. NO ONE INSISTS. BEING MASTER OF ONE’S MOODS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE LARGER ANIMALS. NOW I SHALL WITHDRAW MONSIEUR HAPPY TO HAVE BEEN OF HELP TO YOU. THANK YOU; I’D ACCEPT IF I WERE SURE OF NOT BEING A NUISANCE. YOU ARE TOO KIND. THEN I SHALL BRING MY GLASS OVER BESIDE YOURS.

YOU ARE RIGHT. HIS SILENCE IS DEAFENING. IT’S THE SILENCE OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST HEAVY WITH THREATS. AT TIMES I AM AMAZED BY HIS OBSTINACY IN SNUBBING CIVILIZED LANGUAGES. HIS BUSINESS CONSISTS IN ENTERTAINING SAILORS OF ALL NATIONALITIES IN THIS AMSTERDAM BAR WHICH FOR THAT MATTER HE NAMED—NO ONE KNOWS WHY—MEXICO CITY. WITH SUCH DUTIES WOULDN’T YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME FEAR THAT HIS IGNORANCE WOULD BE AWKWARD? FANCY THE CRO-MAGNON MAN LODGED IN THE TOWER OF BABEL! HE WOULD CERTAINLY FEEL OUT OF HIS ELEMENT. YET THIS ONE IS NOT AWARE OF HIS EXILE; HE GOES HIS OWN SWEET WAY AND NOTHING TOUCHES HIM. ONE OF THE RARE SENTENCES I HAVE EVER HEARD FROM HIS MOUTH PROCLAIMED THAT YOU COULD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. WHAT DID ONE HAVE TO TAKE OR LEAVE? DOUBTLESS OUR FRIEND HIMSELF. I CONFESS I AM DRAWN BY SUCH CREATURES WHO ARE ALL OF A PIECE. ANYONE WHO HAS CONSIDERABLY MEDITATED ON MAN BY PROFESSION OR VOCATION IS LED TO FEEL NOSTALGIA FOR THE PRIMATES. THEY AT LEAST DON’T HAVE ANY ULTERIOR MOTIVES.

OUR HOST TO TELL THE TRUTH HAS SOME ALTHOUGH HE HARBORS THEM DEEP WITHIN HIM. AS A RESULT OF NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS SAID IN HIS PRESENCE HE HAS ADOPTED A DISTRUSTFUL DISPOSITION. WHENCE THAT LOOK OF TOUCHY DIGNITY AS IF HE AT LEAST SUSPECTED THAT ALL IS NOT PERFECT AMONG MEN. THAT DISPOSITION MAKES IT LESS EASY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH HIM THAT DOES NOT CONCERN HIS BUSINESS. NOTICE FOR INSTANCE ON THE BACK WALL ABOVE HIS HEAD THAT EMPTY RECTANGLE MARKING THE PLACE WHERE A PICTURE HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN. INDEED THERE WAS A PICTURE THERE AND A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ONE A REAL MASTERPIECE. WELL I WAS PRESENT WHEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE RECEIVED IT AND WHEN HE GAVE IT UP. IN BOTH CASES HE DID SO WITH THE SAME DISTRUST AFTER WEEKS OF RUMINATION. IN THAT REGARD YOU MUST ADMIT THAT SOCIETY HAS SOMEWHAT SPOILED THE FRANK SIMPLICITY OF HIS NATURE.

MIND YOU I AM NOT JUDGING HIM. I CONSIDER HIS DISTRUST JUSTIFIED AND SHOULD BE INCLINED TO SHARE IT IF AS YOU SEE MY COMMUNICATIVE NATURE WERE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS. I AM TALKATIVE ALAS AND MAKE FRIENDS EASILY. ALTHOUGH I KNOW HOW TO KEEP MY DISTANCE I SEIZE ANY AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY. WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN FRANCE WERE I TO MEET AN INTELLIGENT MAN I IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT HIS COMPANY. IF THAT BE FOOLISH … AH I SEE YOU SMILE AT THAT USE OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE. I CONFESS MY WEAKNESS FOR THAT MOOD AND FOR FINE SPEECH IN GENERAL. A WEAKNESS THAT I CRITICIZE IN MYSELF BELIEVE ME. I AM WELL AWARE THAT AN ADDICTION TO SILK UNDERWEAR DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT ONE’S FEET ARE DIRTY. NONETHELESS STYLE LIKE SHEER SILK TOO OFTEN HIDES ECZEMA. MY CONSOLATION IS TO TELL MYSELF THAT AFTER ALL THOSE WHO MURDER THE LANGUAGE ARE NOT PURE EITHER. WHY YES LET’S HAVE ANOTHER GIN.

ARE YOU STAYING LONG IN AMSTERDAM? A BEAUTIFUL CITY ISN’T IT? FASCINATING? THERE’S AN ADJECTIVE I HAVEN’T HEARD IN SOME TIME. NOT SINCE LEAVING PARIS IN FACT YEARS AGO. BUT THE HEART HAS ITS OWN MEMORY AND I HAVE FORGOTTEN NOTHING OF OUR BEAUTIFUL CAPITAL NOR OF ITS QUAYS. PARIS IS A REAL TROMPE-L’ŒIL A MAGNIFICENT STAGE-SETTING INHABITED BY FOUR MILLION SILHOUETTES. NEARLY FIVE MILLION AT THE LAST CENSUS? WHY THEY MUST HAVE MULTIPLIED. AND THAT WOULDN’T SURPRISE ME. IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT OUR FELLOW CITIZENS HAD TWO PASSIONS: IDEAS AND FORNICATION. WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON SO TO SPEAK. STILL LET US TAKE CARE NOT TO CONDEMN THEM; THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FOR ALL EUROPE IS IN THE SAME BOAT. I SOMETIMES THINK OF WHAT FUTURE HISTORIANS WILL SAY OF US. A SINGLE SENTENCE WILL SUFFICE FOR MODERN MAN: HE FORNICATED AND READ THE PAPERS. AFTER THAT VIGOROUS DEFINITION THE SUBJECT WILL BE IF I MAY SAY SO EXHAUSTED.

OH NOT THE DUTCH; THEY ARE MUCH LESS MODERN! THEY HAVE TIME—JUST LOOK AT THEM. WHAT DO THEY DO? WELL THESE GENTLEMEN OVER HERE LIVE OFF THE LABORS OF THOSE LADIES OVER THERE. ALL OF THEM MOREOVER BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ARE VERY MIDDLE-CLASS CREATURES WHO HAVE COME HERE AS USUAL OUT OF MYTHOMANIA OR STUPIDITY. THROUGH TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE IMAGINATION IN SHORT. FROM TIME TO TIME THESE GENTLEMEN INDULGE IN A LITTLE KNIFE- OR REVOLVER-PLAY BUT DON’T GET THE IDEA THAT THEY’RE KEEN ON IT. THEIR ROLE CALLS FOR IT THAT’S ALL AND THEY ARE DYING OF FRIGHT AS THEY SHOOT IT OUT. NEVERTHELESS I FIND THEM MORE MORAL THAN THE OTHERS THOSE WHO KILL IN THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY BY ATTRITION. HAVEN’T YOU NOTICED THAT OUR SOCIETY IS ORGANIZED FOR THIS KIND OF LIQUIDATION? YOU HAVE HEARD OF COURSE OF THOSE TINY FISH IN THE RIVERS OF BRAZIL THAT ATTACK THE UNWARY SWIMMER BY THOUSANDS AND WITH SWIFT LITTLE NIBBLES CLEAN HIM UP IN A FEW MINUTES LEAVING ONLY AN IMMACULATE SKELETON? WELL THAT’S WHAT THEIR ORGANIZATION IS. “DO YOU WANT A GOOD CLEAN LIFE? LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?” YOU SAY YES OF COURSE. HOW CAN ONE SAY NO? “O.K. YOU’LL BE CLEANED UP. HERE’S A JOB A FAMILY AND ORGANIZED LEISURE ACTIVITIES.” AND THE LITTLE TEETH ATTACK THE FLESH RIGHT DOWN TO THE BONE. BUT I AM UNJUST. I SHOULDN’T SAY THEIR ORGANIZATION. IT IS OURS AFTER ALL: IT’S A QUESTION OF WHICH WILL CLEAN UP THE OTHER.

HERE IS OUR GIN AT LAST. TO YOUR PROSPERITY. YES THE APE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO CALL ME DOCTOR. IN THESE COUNTRIES EVERYONE IS A DOCTOR OR A PROFESSOR. THEY LIKE SHOWING RESPECT OUT OF KINDNESS AND OUT OF MODESTY. AMONG THEM AT LEAST SPITEFULNESS IS NOT A NATIONAL INSTITUTION. BESIDES I AM NOT A DOCTOR. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW I WAS A LAWYER BEFORE COMING HERE. NOW I AM A JUDGE-PENITENT.

BUT ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF: JEAN-BAPTISTE CLAMENCE AT YOUR SERVICE. PLEASED TO KNOW YOU. YOU ARE IN BUSINESS NO DOUBT? IN A WAY? EXCELLENT REPLY! JUDICIOUS TOO: IN ALL THINGS WE ARE MERELY “IN A WAY.” NOW ALLOW ME TO PLAY THE DETECTIVE. YOU ARE MY AGE IN A WAY WITH THE SOPHISTICATED EYE OF THE MAN IN HIS FORTIES WHO HAS SEEN EVERYTHING IN A WAY; YOU ARE WELL DRESSED IN A WAY THAT IS AS PEOPLE ARE IN OUR COUNTRY; AND YOUR HANDS ARE SMOOTH. HENCE A BOURGEOIS IN A WAY! BUT A CULTURED BOURGEOIS! SMILING AT THE USE OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE IN FACT PROVES YOUR CULTURE TWICE OVER BECAUSE YOU RECOGNIZE IT TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN BECAUSE YOU FEEL SUPERIOR TO IT. LASTLY I AMUSE YOU. AND BE IT SAID WITHOUT VANITY THIS IMPLIES IN YOU A CERTAIN OPEN-MINDEDNESS. CONSEQUENTLY YOU ARE IN A WAY … BUT NO MATTER. PROFESSIONS INTEREST ME LESS THAN SECTS. ALLOW ME TO ASK YOU TWO QUESTIONS AND DON’T ANSWER IF YOU CONSIDER THEM INDISCREET. DO YOU HAVE ANY POSSESSIONS? SOME? GOOD. HAVE YOU SHARED THEM WITH THE POOR? NO? THEN YOU ARE WHAT I CALL A SADDUCEE. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SCRIPTURES I ADMIT THAT THIS WON’T HELP YOU. BUT IT DOES HELP YOU? SO YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURES? DECIDEDLY YOU INTEREST ME.

AS FOR ME … WELL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. BY MY STATURE MY SHOULDERS AND THIS FACE THAT I HAVE OFTEN BEEN TOLD WAS SHY I RATHER LOOK LIKE A RUGBY PLAYER DON’T I? BUT IF I AM JUDGED BY MY CONVERSATION I HAVE TO BE GRANTED A LITTLE SUBTLETY. THE CAMEL THAT PROVIDED THE HAIR FOR MY OVERCOAT WAS PROBABLY MANGY; YET MY NAILS ARE MANICURED. I TOO AM SOPHISTICATED AND YET I CONFIDE IN YOU WITHOUT CAUTION ON THE SOLE BASIS OF YOUR LOOKS. FINALLY DESPITE MY GOOD MANNERS AND MY FINE SPEECH I FREQUENT SAILORS’ BARS IN THE ZEEDIJK. COME ON GIVE UP. MY PROFESSION IS DOUBLE THAT’S ALL LIKE THE HUMAN BEING. I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I AM A JUDGE-PENITENT. ONLY ONE THING IS SIMPLE IN MY CASE: I POSSESS NOTHING. YES I WAS RICH. NO I SHARED NOTHING WITH THE POOR. WHAT DOES THAT PROVE? THAT I TOO WAS A SADDUCEE … OH DO YOU HEAR THE FOGHORNS IN THE HARBOR? THERE’LL BE FOG TONIGHT ON THE ZUIDER ZEE.

YOU’RE LEAVING ALREADY? FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING PERHAPS DETAINED YOU. NO I BEG YOU; I WON’T LET YOU PAY. I AM AT HOME AT MEXICO CITY AND HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO RECEIVE YOU HERE. I SHALL CERTAINLY BE HERE TOMORROW AS I AM EVERY EVENING AND I SHALL BE PLEASED TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION. YOUR WAY BACK?… WELL … BUT IF YOU DON’T HAVE ANY OBJECTION THE EASIEST THING WOULD BE FOR ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU AS FAR AS THE HARBOR. THENCE BY GOING AROUND THE JEWISH QUARTER YOU’LL FIND THOSE FINE AVENUES WITH THEIR PARADE OF STREETCARS FULL OF FLOWERS AND THUNDERING SOUNDS. YOUR HOTEL IS ON ONE OF THEM THE DAMRAK. YOU FIRST PLEASE. I LIVE IN THE JEWISH QUARTER OR WHAT WAS CALLED SO UNTIL OUR HITLERIAN BRETHREN MADE ROOM. WHAT A CLEANUP! SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND JEWS DEPORTED OR ASSASSINATED; THAT’S REAL VACUUM-CLEANING. I ADMIRE THAT DILIGENCE THAT METHODICAL PATIENCE! WHEN ONE HAS NO CHARACTER ONE HAS TO APPLY A METHOD. HERE IT DID WONDERS INCONTROVERTIBLY AND I AM LIVING ON THE SITE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST CRIMES IN HISTORY. PERHAPS THAT’S WHAT HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND THE APE AND HIS DISTRUST. THUS I CAN STRUGGLE AGAINST MY NATURAL INCLINATION CARRYING ME TOWARD FRATERNIZING. WHEN I SEE A NEW FACE SOMETHING IN ME SOUNDS THE ALARM. “SLOW! DANGER!” EVEN WHEN THE ATTRACTION IS STRONGEST I AM ON MY GUARD.

DO YOU KNOW THAT IN MY LITTLE VILLAGE DURING A PUNITIVE OPERATION A GERMAN OFFICER COURTEOUSLY ASKED AN OLD WOMAN TO PLEASE CHOOSE WHICH OF HER TWO SONS WOULD BE SHOT AS A HOSTAGE? CHOOSE!—CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? THAT ONE? NO THIS ONE. AND SEE HIM GO. LET’S NOT DWELL ON IT BUT BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR ANY SURPRISE IS POSSIBLE. I KNEW A PURE HEART WHO REJECTED DISTRUST. HE WAS A PACIFIST AND LIBERTARIAN AND LOVED ALL HUMANITY AND THE ANIMALS WITH AN EQUAL LOVE. AN EXCEPTIONAL SOUL THAT’S CERTAIN. WELL DURING THE LAST WARS OF RELIGION IN EUROPE HE HAD RETIRED TO THE COUNTRY. HE HAD WRITTEN ON HIS THRESHOLD: “WHEREVER YOU COME FROM COME IN AND BE WELCOME.” WHO DO YOU THINK ANSWERED THAT NOBLE INVITATION? THE MILITIA WHO MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME AND DISEMBOWELED HIM.

OH PARDON MADAME! BUT SHE DIDN’T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT ANYWAY. ALL THESE PEOPLE EH? OUT SO LATE DESPITE THIS RAIN WHICH HASN’T LET UP FOR DAYS. FORTUNATELY THERE IS GIN THE SOLE GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN THIS DARKNESS. DO YOU FEEL THE GOLDEN COPPER-COLORED LIGHT IT KINDLES IN YOU? I LIKE WALKING THROUGH THE CITY OF AN EVENING IN THE WARMTH OF GIN. I WALK FOR NIGHTS ON END I DREAM OR TALK TO MYSELF INTERMINABLY. YES LIKE THIS EVENING—AND I FEAR MAKING YOUR HEAD SWIM SOMEWHAT. THANK YOU YOU ARE MOST COURTEOUS. BUT IT’S THE OVERFLOW; AS SOON AS I OPEN MY MOUTH SENTENCES START TO FLOW. BESIDES THIS COUNTRY INSPIRES ME. I LIKE THESE PEOPLE SWARMING ON THE SIDEWALKS WEDGED INTO A LITTLE SPACE OF HOUSES AND CANALS HEMMED IN BY FOGS COLD LANDS AND THE SEA STEAMING LIKE A WET WASH. I LIKE THEM FOR THEY ARE DOUBLE. THEY ARE HERE AND ELSEWHERE.

YES INDEED! FROM HEARING THEIR HEAVY TREAD ON THE DAMP PAVEMENT FROM SEEING THEM MOVE HEAVILY BETWEEN THEIR SHOPS FULL OF GILDED HERRINGS AND JEWELS THE COLOR OF DEAD LEAVES YOU PROBABLY THINK THEY ARE HERE THIS EVENING? YOU ARE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE; YOU TAKE THESE GOOD PEOPLE FOR A TRIBE OF SYNDICS AND MERCHANTS COUNTING THEIR GOLD CROWNS WITH THEIR CHANCES OF ETERNAL LIFE WHOSE ONLY LYRICISM CONSISTS IN OCCASIONALLY WITHOUT DOFFING THEIR BROAD-BRIMMED HATS TAKING ANATOMY LESSONS? YOU ARE WRONG. THEY WALK ALONG WITH US TO BE SURE AND YET SEE WHERE THEIR HEADS ARE: IN THAT FOG COMPOUNDED OF NEON GIN AND MINT EMANATING FROM THE SHOP SIGNS ABOVE THEM. HOLLAND IS A DREAM MONSIEUR A DREAM OF GOLD AND SMOKE—SMOKIER BY DAY MORE GILDED BY NIGHT. AND NIGHT AND DAY THAT DREAM IS PEOPLED WITH LOHENGRINS LIKE THESE DREAMILY RIDING THEIR BLACK BICYCLES WITH HIGH HANDLE-BARS FUNEREAL SWANS CONSTANTLY DRIFTING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LAND AROUND THE SEAS ALONG THE CANALS. THEIR HEADS IN THEIR COPPER-COLORED CLOUDS THEY DREAM; THEY CYCLE IN CIRCLES; THEY PRAY SOMNAMBULISTS IN THE FOG’S GILDED INCENSE; THEY HAVE CEASED TO BE HERE. THEY HAVE GONE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY TOWARD JAVA THE DISTANT ISLE. THEY PRAY TO THOSE GRIMACING GODS OF INDONESIA WITH WHICH THEY HAVE DECORATED ALL THEIR SHOPWINDOWS AND WHICH AT THIS MOMENT ARE FLOATING AIMLESSLY ABOVE US BEFORE ALIGHTING LIKE SUMPTUOUS MONKEYS ON THE SIGNS AND STEPPED ROOFS TO REMIND THESE HOMESICK COLONIALS THAT HOLLAND IS NOT ONLY THE EUROPE OF MERCHANTS BUT ALSO THE SEA THE SEA THAT LEADS TO CIPANGO AND TO THOSE ISLANDS WHERE MEN DIE MAD AND HAPPY.

BUT I AM LETTING MYSELF GO! I AM PLEADING A CASE! FORGIVE ME. HABIT MONSIEUR VOCATION ALSO THE DESIRE TO MAKE YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS CITY AND THE HEART OF THINGS! FOR WE ARE AT THE HEART OF THINGS HERE. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT AMSTERDAM’S CONCENTRIC CANALS RESEMBLE THE CIRCLES OF HELL? THE MIDDLE-CLASS HELL OF COURSE PEOPLED WITH BAD DREAMS. WHEN ONE COMES FROM THE OUTSIDE AS ONE GRADUALLY GOES THROUGH THOSE CIRCLES LIFE—AND HENCE ITS CRIMES—BECOMES DENSER DARKER. HERE WE ARE IN THE LAST CIRCLE. THE CIRCLE OF THE … AH YOU KNOW THAT? BY HEAVEN YOU BECOME HARDER TO CLASSIFY. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THEN WHY I CAN SAY THAT THE CENTER OF THINGS IS HERE ALTHOUGH WE STAND AT THE TIP OF THE CONTINENT. A SENSITIVE MAN GRASPS SUCH ODDITIES. IN ANY CASE THE NEWSPAPER READERS AND THE FORNICATORS CAN GO NO FURTHER. THEY COME FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF EUROPE AND STOP FACING THE INNER SEA ON THE DRAB STRAND. THEY LISTEN TO THE FOGHORNS VAINLY TRY TO MAKE OUT THE SILHOUETTES OF BOATS IN THE FOG THEN TURN BACK OVER THE CANALS AND GO HOME THROUGH THE RAIN. CHILLED TO THE BONE THEY COME AND ASK IN ALL LANGUAGES FOR GIN AT MEXICO CITY. THERE I WAIT FOR THEM.

TILL TOMORROW THEN MONSIEUR ET CHER COMPATRIOTE. NO YOU WILL EASILY FIND YOUR WAY NOW: I’LL LEAVE YOU NEAR THIS BRIDGE. I NEVER CROSS A BRIDGE AT NIGHT. IT’S THE RESULT OF A VOW. SUPPOSE AFTER ALL THAT SOMEONE SHOULD JUMP IN THE WATER. ONE OF TWO THINGS—EITHER YOU DO LIKEWISE TO FISH HIM OUT AND IN COLD WEATHER YOU RUN A GREAT RISK! OR YOU FORSAKE HIM THERE AND SUPPRESSED DIVES SOMETIMES LEAVE ONE STRANGELY ACHING. GOOD NIGHT. WHAT? THOSE LADIES BEHIND THOSE WINDOWS? DREAM MONSIEUR CHEAP DREAM A TRIP TO THE INDIES! THOSE PERSONS PERFUME THEMSELVES WITH SPICES. YOU GO IN THEY DRAW THE CURTAINS AND THE NAVIGATION BEGINS. THE GODS COME DOWN ONTO THE NAKED BODIES AND THE ISLANDS ARE SET ADRIFT LOST SOULS CROWNED WITH THE TOUSLED HAIR OF PALM TREES IN THE WIND. TRY IT.

WHAT IS A JUDGE-PENITENT? AH I INTRIGUED YOU WITH THAT BUSINESS. I MEANT NO HARM BY IT BELIEVE ME AND I CAN EXPLAIN MYSELF MORE CLEARLY. IN A WAY THAT EVEN BELONGS TO MY OFFICIAL DUTIES. BUT FIRST I MUST SET FORTH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FACTS THAT WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND MY STORY.

A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS A LAWYER IN PARIS AND INDEED A RATHER WELL-KNOWN LAWYER. OF COURSE I DIDN’T TELL YOU MY REAL NAME. I HAD A SPECIALTY: NOBLE CASES. WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AS THE SAYING GOES—I DON’T KNOW WHY BECAUSE THERE ARE IMPROPER WIDOWS AND FEROCIOUS ORPHANS. YET IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME TO SNIFF THE SLIGHTEST SCENT OF VICTIM ON A DEFENDANT FOR ME TO SWING INTO ACTION. AND WHAT ACTION! A REAL TORNADO! MY HEART WAS ON MY SLEEVE. YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE THOUGHT THAT JUSTICE SLEPT WITH ME EVERY NIGHT. I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE ADMIRED THE RIGHTNESS OF MY TONE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF MY EMOTION THE PERSUASION AND WARMTH THE RESTRAINED INDIGNATION OF MY SPEECHES BEFORE THE COURT. NATURE FAVORED ME AS TO MY PHYSIQUE AND THE NOBLE ATTITUDE COMES EFFORTLESSLY. FURTHERMORE I WAS BUOYED UP BY TWO SINCERE FEELINGS: THE SATISFACTION OF BEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BAR AND AN INSTINCTIVE SCORN FOR JUDGES IN GENERAL. THAT SCORN AFTER ALL WASN’T PERHAPS SO INSTINCTIVE. I KNOW NOW THAT IT HAD ITS REASONS. BUT SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKED RATHER LIKE A PASSION. IT CAN’T BE DENIED THAT FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST WE HAVE TO HAVE JUDGES DON’T WE? HOWEVER I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A MAN COULD OFFER HIMSELF TO PERFORM SUCH A SURPRISING FUNCTION. I ACCEPTED THE FACT BECAUSE I SAW IT BUT RATHER AS I ACCEPTED LOCUSTS. WITH THIS DIFFERENCE: THAT THE INVASIONS OF THOSE ORTHOPTERA NEVER BROUGHT ME A SOU WHEREAS I EARNED MY LIVING BY CARRYING ON A DIALOGUE WITH PEOPLE I SCORNED.

BUT AFTER ALL I WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE; THAT WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY CONSCIENCE. THE FEELING OF THE LAW THE SATISFACTION OF BEING RIGHT THE JOY OF SELF-ESTEEM CHER MONSIEUR ARE POWERFUL INCENTIVES FOR KEEPING US UPRIGHT OR KEEPING US MOVING FORWARD. ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DEPRIVE MEN OF THEM YOU TRANSFORM THEM INTO DOGS FROTHING WITH RAGE. HOW MANY CRIMES COMMITTED MERELY BECAUSE THEIR AUTHORS COULD NOT ENDURE BEING WRONG! I ONCE KNEW A MANUFACTURER WHO HAD A PERFECT WIFE ADMIRED BY ALL AND YET HE DECEIVED HER. THAT MAN WAS LITERALLY FURIOUS TO BE IN THE WRONG TO BE BLOCKED FROM RECEIVING OR GRANTING HIMSELF A CERTIFICATE OF VIRTUE. THE MORE VIRTUES HIS WIFE MANIFESTED THE MORE VEXED HE BECAME. EVENTUALLY LIVING IN THE WRONG BECAME UNBEARABLE TO HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID THEN? HE GAVE UP DECEIVING HER? NOT AT ALL. HE KILLED HER. THAT IS HOW I ENTERED INTO RELATIONS WITH HIM.

MY SITUATION WAS MORE ENVIABLE. NOT ONLY DID I RUN NO RISK OF JOINING THE CRIMINAL CAMP (IN PARTICULAR I HAD NO CHANCE OF KILLING MY WIFE BEING A BACHELOR) BUT I EVEN TOOK UP THEIR DEFENSE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD BE NOBLE MURDERERS AS OTHERS ARE NOBLE SAVAGES. THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH I CONDUCTED THAT DEFENSE GAVE ME GREAT SATISFACTIONS. I WAS TRULY ABOVE REPROACH IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. I NEVER ACCEPTED A BRIBE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AND I NEVER STOOPED EITHER TO ANY SHADY PROCEEDINGS. AND—THIS IS EVEN RARER—I NEVER DEIGNED TO FLATTER ANY JOURNALIST TO GET HIM ON MY SIDE NOR ANY CIVIL SERVANT WHOSE FRIENDSHIP MIGHT BE USEFUL TO ME. I EVEN HAD THE LUCK OF SEEING THE LEGION OF HONOR OFFERED TO ME TWO OR THREE TIMES AND OF BEING ABLE TO REFUSE IT WITH A DISCREET DIGNITY IN WHICH I FOUND MY TRUE REWARD. FINALLY I NEVER CHARGED THE POOR A FEE AND NEVER BOASTED OF IT. DON’T THINK FOR A MOMENT CHER MONSIEUR THAT I AM BRAGGING. I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS. THE AVIDITY WHICH IN OUR SOCIETY SUBSTITUTES FOR AMBITION HAS ALWAYS MADE ME LAUGH. I WAS AIMING HIGHER; YOU WILL SEE THAT THE EXPRESSION IS EXACT IN MY CASE.

BUT YOU CAN ALREADY IMAGINE MY SATISFACTION. I ENJOYED MY OWN NATURE TO THE FULLEST AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE LIES HAPPINESS ALTHOUGH TO SOOTHE ONE ANOTHER MUTUALLY WE OCCASIONALLY PRETEND TO CONDEMN SUCH JOYS AS SELFISHNESS. AT LEAST I ENJOYED THAT PART OF MY NATURE WHICH REACTED SO APPROPRIATELY TO THE WIDOW AND ORPHAN THAT EVENTUALLY THROUGH EXERCISE IT CAME TO DOMINATE MY WHOLE LIFE. FOR INSTANCE I LOVED TO HELP BLIND PEOPLE CROSS STREETS. FROM AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD SEE A CANE HESITATING ON THE EDGE OF A SIDEWALK I WOULD RUSH FORWARD SOMETIMES ONLY A SECOND AHEAD OF ANOTHER CHARITABLE HAND ALREADY OUTSTRETCHED SNATCH THE BLIND PERSON FROM ANY SOLICITUDE BUT MINE AND LEAD HIM GENTLY BUT FIRMLY ALONG THE CROSSWALK AMONG THE TRAFFIC OBSTACLES TOWARD THE REFUGE OF THE OTHER SIDEWALK WHERE WE WOULD SEPARATE WITH A MUTUAL EMOTION. IN THE SAME WAY I ALWAYS ENJOYED GIVING DIRECTIONS IN THE STREET OBLIGING WITH A LIGHT LENDING A HAND TO HEAVY PUSHCARTS PUSHING A STRANDED CAR BUYING A PAPER FROM THE SALVATION ARMY LASS OR FLOWERS FROM THE OLD PEDDLER THOUGH I KNEW SHE STOLE THEM FROM THE MONTPARNASSE CEMETERY. I ALSO LIKED—AND THIS IS HARDER TO SAY—I LIKED TO GIVE ALMS. A VERY CHRISTIAN FRIEND OF MINE ADMITTED THAT ONE’S INITIAL FEELING ON SEEING A BEGGAR APPROACH ONE’S HOUSE IS UNPLEASANT. WELL WITH ME IT WAS WORSE: I USED TO EXULT. BUT LET’S NOT DWELL ON THIS.

LET US SPEAK RATHER OF MY COURTESY. IT WAS FAMOUS AND UNQUESTIONABLE. INDEED GOOD MANNERS PROVIDED ME WITH GREAT DELIGHTS. IF I HAD THE LUCK CERTAIN MORNINGS TO GIVE UP MY SEAT IN THE BUS OR SUBWAY TO SOMEONE WHO OBVIOUSLY DESERVED IT TO PICK UP SOME OBJECT AN OLD LADY HAD DROPPED AND RETURN IT TO HER WITH A SMILE I KNEW WELL OR MERELY TO FORFEIT MY TAXI TO SOMEONE IN A GREATER HURRY THAN I IT WAS A RED-LETTER DAY. I EVEN REJOICED I MUST ADMIT THOSE DAYS WHEN THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM BEING ON STRIKE I HAD A CHANCE TO LOAD INTO MY CAR AT THE BUS STOPS SOME OF MY UNFORTUNATE FELLOW CITIZENS UNABLE TO GET HOME. GIVING UP MY SEAT IN THE THEATER TO ALLOW A COUPLE TO SIT TOGETHER HOISTING A GIRL’S SUITCASES ONTO THE RACK IN A TRAIN—THESE WERE ALL DEEDS I PERFORMED MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS BECAUSE I PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND WAS BETTER ABLE TO RELISH THE PLEASURE THEY GIVE.

CONSEQUENTLY I WAS CONSIDERED GENEROUS AND SO I WAS. I GAVE A GREAT DEAL IN PUBLIC AND IN PRIVATE. BUT FAR FROM SUFFERING WHEN I HAD TO GIVE UP AN OBJECT OR A SUM OF MONEY I DERIVED CONSTANT PLEASURES FROM THIS—AMONG THEM A SORT OF MELANCHOLY WHICH OCCASIONALLY ROSE WITHIN ME AT THE THOUGHT OF THE STERILITY OF THOSE GIFTS AND THE PROBABLE INGRATITUDE THAT WOULD FOLLOW. I EVEN TOOK SUCH PLEASURE IN GIVING THAT I HATED TO BE OBLIGED TO DO SO. EXACTITUDE IN MONEY MATTERS BORED ME TO DEATH AND I CONFORMED UNGRACIOUSLY. I HAD TO BE THE MASTER OF MY LIBERALITIES.

THESE ARE JUST LITTLE TOUCHES BUT THEY WILL HELP YOU GRASP THE CONSTANT DELIGHTS I EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE AND ESPECIALLY IN MY PROFESSION. BEING STOPPED IN THE CORRIDOR OF THE LAW COURTS BY THE WIFE OF A DEFENDANT YOU REPRESENTED OUT OF JUSTICE OR PITY ALONE—I MEAN WITHOUT CHARGE—HEARING THAT WOMAN WHISPER THAT NOTHING NO NOTHING COULD EVER REPAY WHAT YOU HAD DONE FOR THEM REPLYING THAT IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH EVEN OFFERING SOME FINANCIAL HELP TO TIDE OVER THE BAD DAYS AHEAD THEN—IN ORDER TO CUT THE EFFUSIONS SHORT AND PRESERVE THEIR PROPER RESONANCE—KISSING THE HAND OF A POOR WOMAN AND BREAKING AWAY—BELIEVE ME CHER MONSIEUR THIS IS ACHIEVING MORE THAN THE VULGAR AMBITIOUS MAN AND RISING TO THAT SUPREME SUMMIT WHERE VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD.

LET’S PAUSE ON THESE HEIGHTS. NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SPOKE OF AIMING HIGHER. I WAS TALKING IT SO HAPPENS OF THOSE SUPREME SUMMITS THE ONLY PLACES I CAN REALLY LIVE. YES I HAVE NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE EXCEPT IN LOFTY PLACES. EVEN IN THE DETAILS OF DAILY LIFE I NEEDED TO FEEL ABOVE. I PREFERRED THE BUS TO THE SUBWAY OPEN CARRIAGES TO TAXIS TERRACES TO CLOSED-IN PLACES. AN ENTHUSIAST FOR SPORT PLANES IN WHICH ONE’S HEAD IS IN THE OPEN ON BOATS I WAS THE ETERNAL PACER OF THE TOP DECK. IN THE MOUNTAINS I USED TO FLEE THE DEEP VALLEYS FOR THE PASSES AND PLATEAUS; I WAS THE MAN OF THE MESAS AT LEAST. IF FATE HAD FORCED ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WORK AT A LATHE OR AS A ROOFER DON’T WORRY I’D HAVE CHOSEN THE ROOFS AND BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH DIZZINESS. COALBINS SHIPS’ HOLDS UNDERGROUNDS GROTTOES PITS WERE REPULSIVE TO ME. I HAD EVEN DEVELOPED A SPECIAL LOATHING FOR SPELEOLOGISTS WHO HAD THE NERVE TO FILL THE FRONT PAGE OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND WHOSE RECORDS NAUSEATED ME. STRIVING TO REACH ELEVATION MINUS EIGHT HUNDRED AT THE RISK OF GETTING ONE’S HEAD CAUGHT IN A ROCKY FUNNEL (A SIPHON AS THOSE FOOLS SAY!) SEEMED TO ME THE EXPLOIT OF PERVERTED OR TRAUMATIZED CHARACTERS. THERE WAS SOMETHING CRIMINAL UNDERLYING IT.

A NATURAL BALCONY FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET ABOVE A SEA STILL VISIBLE BATHED IN SUNLIGHT ON THE OTHER HAND WAS THE PLACE WHERE I COULD BREATHE MOST FREELY ESPECIALLY IF I WERE ALONE WELL ABOVE THE HUMAN ANTS. I COULD READILY UNDERSTAND WHY SERMONS DECISIVE PREACHINGS AND FIRE MIRACLES TOOK PLACE ON ACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS. IN MY OPINION NO ONE MEDITATED IN CELLARS OR PRISON CELLS (UNLESS THEY WERE SITUATED IN A TOWER WITH A BROAD VIEW); ONE JUST BECAME MOLDY. AND I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT MAN WHO HAVING ENTERED HOLY ORDERS GAVE UP THE FROCK BECAUSE HIS CELL INSTEAD OF OVERLOOKING A VAST LANDSCAPE AS HE EXPECTED LOOKED OUT ON A WALL. REST ASSURED THAT AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I DID NOT GROW MOLDY. AT EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY WITHIN MYSELF AND AMONG OTHERS I WOULD SCALE THE HEIGHTS AND LIGHT CONSPICUOUS FIRES AND A JOYFUL GREETING WOULD RISE TOWARD ME. THUS AT LEAST I TOOK PLEASURE IN LIFE AND IN MY OWN EXCELLENCE.

MY PROFESSION SATISFIED MOST HAPPILY THAT VOCATION FOR SUMMITS. IT CLEANSED ME OF ALL BITTERNESS TOWARD MY NEIGHBOR WHOM I ALWAYS OBLIGATED WITHOUT EVER OWING HIM ANYTHING. IT SET ME ABOVE THE JUDGE WHOM I JUDGED IN TURN ABOVE THE DEFENDANT WHOM I FORCED TO GRATITUDE. JUST WEIGH THIS CHER MONSIEUR I LIVED WITH IMPUNITY. I WAS CONCERNED IN NO JUDGMENT; I WAS NOT ON THE FLOOR OF THE COURTROOM BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE FLIES LIKE THOSE GODS THAT ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY MACHINERY FROM TIME TO TIME TO TRANSFIGURE THE ACTION AND GIVE IT ITS MEANING. AFTER ALL LIVING ALOFT IS STILL THE ONLY WAY OF BEING SEEN AND HAILED BY THE LARGEST NUMBER.

BESIDES SOME OF MY GOOD CRIMINALS HAD KILLED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SAME FEELING. READING THE NEWSPAPERS AFTERWARD IN THE SORRY CONDITION IN WHICH THEY THEN WERE DOUBTLESS BROUGHT THEM A SORT OF UNHAPPY COMPENSATION. LIKE MANY MEN THEY HAD NO LONGER BEEN ABLE TO ENDURE ANONYMITY AND THAT IMPATIENCE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO LEADING THEM TO UNFORTUNATE EXTREMITIES. TO ACHIEVE NOTORIETY IT IS ENOUGH AFTER ALL TO KILL ONE’S CONCIERGE. UNHAPPILY THIS IS USUALLY AN EPHEMERAL REPUTATION SO MANY CONCIERGES ARE THERE WHO DESERVE AND RECEIVE THE KNIFE. CRIME CONSTANTLY MONOPOLIZES THE HEADLINES BUT THE CRIMINAL APPEARS THERE ONLY FUGITIVELY TO BE REPLACED AT ONCE. IN SHORT SUCH BRIEF TRIUMPHS COST TOO DEAR. DEFENDING OUR UNFORTUNATE ASPIRANTS AFTER A REPUTATION AMOUNTED ON THE OTHER HAND TO BECOMING REALLY WELL KNOWN AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME PLACES BUT BY MORE ECONOMICAL MEANS. CONSEQUENTLY THIS ENCOURAGED ME TO MAKING MORE MERITORIOUS EFFORTS SO THAT THEY WOULD PAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. WHAT THEY WERE PAYING THEY WERE DOING SO TO SOME EXTENT IN MY PLACE. THE INDIGNATION TALENT AND EMOTION I EXPENDED ON THEM WASHED AWAY IN RETURN ANY DEBT I MIGHT FEEL TOWARD THEM. THE JUDGES PUNISHED AND THE DEFENDANTS EXPIATED WHILE I FREE OF ANY DUTY SHIELDED FROM JUDGMENT AS FROM PENALTY I FREELY HELD SWAY BATHED IN A LIGHT AS OF EDEN.

INDEED WASN’T THAT EDEN CHER MONSIEUR: NO INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN LIFE AND ME? SUCH WAS MY LIFE. I NEVER HAD TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE. IN THAT REGARD I ALREADY KNEW EVERYTHING AT BIRTH. SOME PEOPLE’S PROBLEM IS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM MEN OR AT LEAST TO COME TO TERMS WITH THEM. IN MY CASE THE UNDERSTANDING WAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED. FAMILIAR WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE SILENT WHEN NECESSARY CAPABLE OF A FREE AND EASY MANNER AS READILY AS OF DIGNITY I WAS ALWAYS IN HARMONY. HENCE MY POPULARITY WAS GREAT AND MY SUCCESSES IN SOCIETY INNUMERABLE. I WAS ACCEPTABLE IN APPEARANCE; I REVEALED MYSELF TO BE BOTH A TIRELESS DANCER AND AN UNOBTRUSIVELY LEARNED MAN; I MANAGED TO LOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY—AND THIS IS NOT EASY—WOMEN AND JUSTICE; I INDULGED IN SPORTS AND THE FINE ARTS—IN SHORT I’LL NOT GO ON FOR FEAR YOU MIGHT SUSPECT ME OF SELF-FLATTERY. BUT JUST IMAGINE I BEG YOU A MAN AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS IN PERFECT HEALTH GENEROUSLY GIFTED SKILLED IN BODILY EXERCISES AS IN THOSE OF THE MIND NEITHER RICH NOR POOR SLEEPING WELL AND FUNDAMENTALLY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF WITHOUT SHOWING THIS OTHERWISE THAN BY A FELICITOUS SOCIABILITY. YOU WILL READILY SEE HOW I CAN SPEAK WITHOUT IMMODESTY OF A SUCCESSFUL LIFE.

YES FEW CREATURES WERE MORE NATURAL THAN I. I WAS ALTOGETHER IN HARMONY WITH LIFE FITTING INTO IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITHOUT REJECTING ANY OF ITS IRONIES ITS GRANDEUR OR ITS SERVITUDE. IN PARTICULAR THE FLESH MATTER THE PHYSICAL IN SHORT WHICH DISCONCERTS OR DISCOURAGES SO MANY MEN IN LOVE OR IN SOLITUDE WITHOUT ENSLAVING ME BROUGHT ME STEADY JOYS. I WAS MADE TO HAVE A BODY. WHENCE THAT HARMONY IN ME THAT RELAXED MASTERY THAT PEOPLE FELT EVEN TO TELLING ME SOMETIMES THAT IT HELPED THEM IN LIFE. HENCE MY COMPANY WAS IN DEMAND. OFTEN FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY HAD MET ME BEFORE. LIFE ITS CREATURES AND ITS GIFTS OFFERED THEMSELVES TO ME AND I ACCEPTED SUCH MARKS OF HOMAGE WITH A KINDLY PRIDE. TO TELL THE TRUTH JUST FROM BEING SO FULLY AND SIMPLY A MAN I LOOKED UPON MYSELF AS SOMETHING OF A SUPERMAN.

I WAS OF RESPECTABLE BUT HUMBLE BIRTH (MY FATHER WAS AN OFFICER) AND YET CERTAIN MORNINGS LET ME CONFESS IT HUMBLY I FELT LIKE A KING’S SON OR A BURNING BUSH. IT WAS NOT A MATTER MIND YOU OF THE CERTAINTY I HAD OF BEING MORE INTELLIGENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE. BESIDES SUCH CERTAINTY IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE SO MANY IMBECILES SHARE IT. NO AS A RESULT OF BEING SHOWERED WITH BLESSINGS I FELT I HESITATE TO ADMIT MARKED OUT. PERSONALLY MARKED OUT AMONG ALL FOR THAT LONG AND UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS. THIS AFTER ALL WAS A RESULT OF MY MODESTY. I REFUSED TO ATTRIBUTE THAT SUCCESS TO MY OWN MERITS AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CONJUNCTION IN A SINGLE PERSON OF SUCH DIFFERENT AND SUCH EXTREME VIRTUES WAS THE RESULT OF CHANCE ALONE. THIS IS WHY IN MY HAPPY LIFE I FELT SOMEHOW THAT THAT HAPPINESS WAS AUTHORIZED BY SOME HIGHER DECREE. WHEN I ADD THAT I HAD NO RELIGION YOU CAN SEE EVEN BETTER HOW EXTRAORDINARY THAT CONVICTION WAS. WHETHER ORDINARY OR NOT IT SERVED FOR SOME TIME TO RAISE ME ABOVE THE DAILY ROUTINE AND I LITERALLY SOARED FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS FOR WHICH TO TELL THE TRUTH I STILL LONG IN MY HEART OF HEARTS. I SOARED UNTIL THE EVENING WHEN … BUT NO THAT’S ANOTHER MATTER AND IT MUST BE FORGOTTEN. ANYWAY I AM PERHAPS EXAGGERATING. I WAS AT EASE IN EVERYTHING TO BE SURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME SATISFIED WITH NOTHING. EACH JOY MADE ME DESIRE ANOTHER. I WENT FROM FESTIVITY TO FESTIVITY. ON OCCASION I DANCED FOR NIGHTS ON END EVER MADDER ABOUT PEOPLE AND LIFE. AT TIMES LATE ON THOSE NIGHTS WHEN THE DANCING THE SLIGHT INTOXICATION MY WILD ENTHUSIASM EVERYONE’S VIOLENT UNRESTRAINT WOULD FILL ME WITH A TIRED AND OVERWHELMED RAPTURE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME—AT THE BREAKING POINT OF FATIGUE AND FOR A SECOND’S FLASH—THAT AT LAST I UNDERSTOOD THE SECRET OF CREATURES AND OF THE WORLD. BUT MY FATIGUE WOULD DISAPPEAR THE NEXT DAY AND WITH IT THE SECRET; I WOULD RUSH FORTH ANEW. I RAN ON LIKE THAT ALWAYS HEAPED WITH FAVORS NEVER SATIATED WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TO STOP UNTIL THE DAY—UNTIL THE EVENING RATHER WHEN THE MUSIC STOPPED AND THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. THE GAY PARTY AT WHICH I HAD BEEN SO HAPPY … BUT ALLOW ME TO CALL ON OUR FRIEND THE PRIMATE. NOD YOUR HEAD TO THANK HIM AND ABOVE ALL DRINK UP WITH ME I NEED YOUR UNDERSTANDING.

I SEE THAT THAT DECLARATION AMAZES YOU. HAVE YOU NEVER SUDDENLY NEEDED UNDERSTANDING HELP FRIENDSHIP? YES OF COURSE. I HAVE LEARNED TO BE SATISFIED WITH UNDERSTANDING. IT IS FOUND MORE READILY AND BESIDES IT’S NOT BINDING. “I BEG YOU TO BELIEVE IN MY SYMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING” IN THE INNER DISCOURSE ALWAYS PRECEDES IMMEDIATELY “AND NOW LET’S TURN TO OTHER MATTERS.” IT’S A BOARD CHAIRMAN’S EMOTION; IT COMES CHEAP AFTER CATASTROPHES. FRIENDSHIP IS LESS SIMPLE. IT IS LONG AND HARD TO OBTAIN BUT WHEN ONE HAS IT THERE’S NO GETTING RID OF IT; ONE SIMPLY HAS TO COPE WITH IT. DON’T THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL TELEPHONE YOU EVERY EVENING AS THEY OUGHT TO IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF THIS DOESN’T HAPPEN TO BE THE EVENING WHEN YOU ARE DECIDING TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR SIMPLY WHETHER YOU DON’T NEED COMPANY WHETHER YOU ARE NOT IN A MOOD TO GO OUT. NO DON’T WORRY THEY’LL RING UP THE EVENING YOU ARE NOT ALONE WHEN LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. AS FOR SUICIDE THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO PUSH YOU TO IT BY VIRTUE OF WHAT YOU OWE TO YOURSELF ACCORDING TO THEM. MAY HEAVEN PROTECT US CHER MONSIEUR FROM BEING SET ON A PEDESTAL BY OUR FRIENDS! THOSE WHOSE DUTY IS TO LOVE US—I MEAN RELATIVES AND CONNECTIONS (WHAT AN EXPRESSION!)—ARE ANOTHER MATTER. THEY FIND THE RIGHT WORD ALL RIGHT AND IT HITS THE BULL’S-EYE; THEY TELEPHONE AS IF SHOOTING A RIFLE. AND THEY KNOW HOW TO AIM. OH THE BAZAINES!

WHAT? WHAT EVENING? I’LL GET TO IT BE PATIENT WITH ME. IN A CERTAIN WAY I AM STICKING TO MY SUBJECT WITH ALL THAT ABOUT FRIENDS AND CONNECTIONS. YOU SEE I’VE HEARD OF A MAN WHOSE FRIEND HAD BEEN IMPRISONED AND WHO SLEPT ON THE FLOOR OF HIS ROOM EVERY NIGHT IN ORDER NOT TO ENJOY A COMFORT OF WHICH HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN DEPRIVED. WHO CHER MONSIEUR WILL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR FOR US? WHETHER I AM CAPABLE OF IT MYSELF? LOOK I’D LIKE TO BE AND I SHALL BE. YES WE SHALL ALL BE CAPABLE OF IT ONE DAY AND THAT WILL BE SALVATION. BUT IT’S NOT EASY FOR FRIENDSHIP IS ABSENT-MINDED OR AT LEAST UNAVAILING. IT IS INCAPABLE OF ACHIEVING WHAT IT WANTS. MAYBE AFTER ALL IT DOESN’T WANT IT ENOUGH? MAYBE WE DON’T LOVE LIFE ENOUGH? HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT DEATH ALONE AWAKENS OUR FEELINGS? HOW WE LOVE THE FRIENDS WHO HAVE JUST LEFT US? HOW WE ADMIRE THOSE OF OUR TEACHERS WHO HAVE CEASED TO SPEAK THEIR MOUTHS FILLED WITH EARTH! THEN THE EXPRESSION OF ADMIRATION SPRINGS FORTH NATURALLY THAT ADMIRATION THEY WERE PERHAPS EXPECTING FROM US ALL THEIR LIVES. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE ALWAYS MORE JUST AND MORE GENEROUS TOWARD THE DEAD? THE REASON IS SIMPLE. WITH THEM THERE IS NO OBLIGATION. THEY LEAVE US FREE AND WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME FIT THE TESTIMONIAL IN BETWEEN A COCKTAIL PARTY AND A NICE LITTLE MISTRESS IN OUR SPARE TIME IN SHORT. IF THEY FORCED US TO ANYTHING IT WOULD BE TO REMEMBERING AND WE HAVE A SHORT MEMORY. NO IT IS THE RECENTLY DEAD WE LOVE AMONG OUR FRIENDS THE PAINFUL DEAD OUR EMOTION OURSELVES AFTER ALL!

FOR INSTANCE I HAD A FRIEND I GENERALLY AVOIDED. HE RATHER BORED ME AND BESIDES HE WAS SOMETHING OF A MORALIST. BUT WHEN HE WAS ON HIS DEATHBED I WAS THERE—DON’T WORRY. I NEVER MISSED A DAY. HE DIED SATISFIED WITH ME HOLDING BOTH MY HANDS. A WOMAN WHO USED TO CHASE AFTER ME AND IN VAIN HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO DIE YOUNG. WHAT ROOM IN MY HEART AT ONCE! AND WHEN IN ADDITION IT’S A SUICIDE! LORD WHAT A DELIGHTFUL COMMOTION! ONE’S TELEPHONE RINGS ONE’S HEART OVERFLOWS AND THE INTENTIONALLY SHORT SENTENCES YET HEAVY WITH IMPLICATIONS ONE’S RESTRAINED SUFFERING AND EVEN YES A BIT OF SELF-ACCUSATION!

THAT’S THE WAY MAN IS CHER MONSIEUR. HE HAS TWO FACES: HE CAN’T LOVE WITHOUT SELF-LOVE. NOTICE YOUR NEIGHBORS IF PERCHANCE A DEATH TAKES PLACE IN THE BUILDING. THEY WERE ASLEEP IN THEIR LITTLE ROUTINE AND SUDDENLY FOR EXAMPLE THE CONCIERGE DIES. AT ONCE THEY AWAKE BESTIR THEMSELVES GET THE DETAILS COMMISERATE. A NEWLY DEAD MAN AND THE SHOW BEGINS AT LAST. THEY NEED TRAGEDY DON’T YOU KNOW; IT’S THEIR LITTLE TRANSCENDENCE THEIR APÉRITIF. MOREOVER IS IT MERE CHANCE THAT I SHOULD SPEAK OF A CONCIERGE? I HAD ONE REALLY ILL FAVORED MALICE INCARNATE A MONSTER OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND RANCOR WHO WOULD HAVE DISCOURAGED A FRANCISCAN. I HAD EVEN GIVEN UP SPEAKING TO HIM BUT BY HIS MERE EXISTENCE HE COMPROMISED MY CUSTOMARY CONTENTEDNESS. HE DIED AND I WENT TO HIS FUNERAL. CAN YOU TELL ME WHY?

ANYWAY THE TWO DAYS PRECEDING THE CEREMONY WERE FULL OF INTEREST. THE CONCIERGE’S WIFE WAS ILL LYING IN THE SINGLE ROOM AND NEAR HER THE COFFIN HAD BEEN SET ON SAWHORSES. EVERYONE HAD TO GET HIS MAIL HIMSELF. YOU OPENED THE DOOR SAID “BONJOUR MADAME” LISTENED TO HER PRAISE OF THE DEAR DEPARTED AS SHE POINTED TO HIM AND TOOK YOUR MAIL. NOTHING VERY AMUSING ABOUT THAT. AND YET THE WHOLE BUILDING PASSED THROUGH HER ROOM WHICH STANK OF CARBOLIC ACID. AND THE TENANTS DIDN’T SEND THEIR SERVANTS EITHER; THEY CAME THEMSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNEXPECTED ATTRACTION. THE SERVANTS DID TOO OF COURSE BUT ON THE SLY. THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL THE COFFIN WAS TOO BIG FOR THE DOOR. “O MY DEARIE” THE WIFE SAID FROM HER BED WITH A SURPRISE AT ONCE DELIGHTED AND GRIEVED “HOW BIG HE WAS!” “DON’T WORRY MADAME” REPLIED THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR “WE’LL GET HIM THROUGH EDGEWISE AND UPRIGHT.” HE WAS GOT THROUGH UPRIGHT AND THEN LAID DOWN AGAIN AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE (WITH A FORMER CABARET DOORMAN WHO I GATHERED USED TO DRINK HIS PERNOD EVERY EVENING WITH THE DEPARTED) TO GO AS FAR AS THE CEMETERY AND STREW FLOWERS ON A COFFIN OF ASTOUNDING LUXURY. THEN I PAID A VISIT TO THE CONCIERGE’S WIFE TO RECEIVE HER THANKS EXPRESSED AS BY A GREAT TRAGEDIENNE. TELL ME WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR ALL THAT? NONE EXCEPT THE APÉRITIF.

I LIKEWISE BURIED AN OLD FELLOW MEMBER OF THE LAWYERS’ GUILD. A CLERK TO WHOM NO ONE PAID ATTENTION BUT I ALWAYS SHOOK HIS HAND. WHERE I WORKED I USED TO SHAKE EVERYONE’S HAND MOREOVER BEING DOUBLY SURE TO MISS NO ONE. WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT SUCH CORDIAL SIMPLICITY WON ME THE POPULARITY SO NECESSARY TO MY CONTENTMENT. FOR THE FUNERAL OF OUR CLERK THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUILD HAD NOT GONE OUT OF HIS WAY. BUT I DID AND ON THE EVE OF A TRIP AS WAS AMPLY POINTED OUT. IT SO HAPPENED THAT I KNEW MY PRESENCE WOULD BE NOTICED AND FAVORABLY COMMENTED ON. HENCE YOU SEE NOT EVEN THE SNOW THAT WAS FALLING THAT DAY MADE ME WITHDRAW.

WHAT? I’M GETTING TO IT NEVER FEAR; BESIDES I HAVE NEVER LEFT IT. BUT LET ME FIRST POINT OUT THAT MY CONCIERGE’S WIFE WHO HAD GONE TO SUCH AN OUTLAY FOR THE CRUCIFIX HEAVY OAK AND SILVER HANDLES IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF HER EMOTION HAD SHACKED UP A MONTH LATER WITH AN OVERDRESSED YOKEL PROUD OF HIS SINGING VOICE. HE USED TO BEAT HER; FRIGHTFUL SCREAMS COULD BE HEARD AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD HE WOULD OPEN THE WINDOW AND GIVE FORTH WITH HIS FAVORITE SONG: “WOMEN HOW PRETTY YOU ARE!” “ALL THE SAME!” THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY. ALL THE SAME WHAT? I ASK YOU. ALL RIGHT APPEARANCES WERE AGAINST THE BARITONE AND AGAINST THE CONCIERGE’S WIFE TOO. BUT NOTHING PROVES THAT THEY WERE NOT IN LOVE. AND NOTHING PROVES EITHER THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HER HUSBAND. MOREOVER WHEN THE YOKEL TOOK FLIGHT HIS VOICE AND ARM EXHAUSTED SHE—THAT FAITHFUL WIFE—RESUMED HER PRAISES OF THE DEPARTED. AFTER ALL I KNOW OF OTHERS WHO HAVE APPEARANCES ON THEIR SIDE AND ARE NO MORE FAITHFUL OR SINCERE. I KNEW A MAN WHO GAVE TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO A SCATTERBRAINED WOMAN SACRIFICING EVERYTHING TO HER HIS FRIENDSHIPS HIS WORK THE VERY RESPECTABILITY OF HIS LIFE AND WHO ONE EVENING RECOGNIZED THAT HE HAD NEVER LOVED HER. HE HAD BEEN BORED THAT’S ALL BORED LIKE MOST PEOPLE. HENCE HE HAD MADE HIMSELF OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH A LIFE FULL OF COMPLICATIONS AND DRAMA. SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN—AND THAT EXPLAINS MOST HUMAN COMMITMENTS. SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN EVEN LOVELESS SLAVERY EVEN WAR OR DEATH. HURRAY THEN FOR FUNERALS!

BUT I AT LEAST DIDN’T HAVE THAT EXCUSE. I WAS NOT BORED BECAUSE I WAS RIDING ON THE CREST OF THE WAVE. ON THE EVENING I AM SPEAKING ABOUT I CAN SAY THAT I WAS EVEN LESS BORED THAN EVER. AND YET … YOU SEE CHER MONSIEUR IT WAS A FINE AUTUMN EVENING STILL WARM IN TOWN AND ALREADY DAMP OVER THE SEINE. NIGHT WAS FALLING; THE SKY STILL BRIGHT IN THE WEST WAS DARKENING; THE STREET LAMPS WERE GLOWING DIMLY. I WAS WALKING UP THE QUAYS OF THE LEFT BANK TOWARD THE PONT DES ARTS. THE RIVER WAS GLEAMING BETWEEN THE STALLS OF THE SECONDHAND BOOKSELLERS. THERE WERE BUT FEW PEOPLE ON THE QUAYS; PARIS WAS ALREADY AT DINNER. I WAS TREADING ON THE DUSTY YELLOW LEAVES THAT STILL RECALLED SUMMER. GRADUALLY THE SKY WAS FILLING WITH STARS THAT COULD BE SEEN FOR A MOMENT AFTER LEAVING ONE STREET LAMP AND HEADING TOWARD ANOTHER. I ENJOYED THE RETURN OF SILENCE THE EVENING’S MILDNESS THE EMPTINESS OF PARIS. I WAS HAPPY. THE DAY HAD BEEN GOOD: A BLIND MAN THE REDUCED SENTENCE I HAD HOPED FOR A CORDIAL HANDCLASP FROM MY CLIENT A FEW LIBERALITIES AND IN THE AFTERNOON A BRILLIANT IMPROVISATION IN THE COMPANY OF SEVERAL FRIENDS ON THE HARD-HEARTEDNESS OF OUR GOVERNING CLASS AND THE HYPOCRISY OF OUR LEADERS.

I HAD GONE UP ON THE PONT DES ARTS DESERTED AT THAT HOUR TO LOOK AT THE RIVER THAT COULD HARDLY BE MADE OUT NOW NIGHT HAD COME. FACING THE STATUE OF THE VERT-GALANT I DOMINATED THE ISLAND. I FELT RISING WITHIN ME A VAST FEELING OF POWER AND—I DON’T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT—OF COMPLETION WHICH CHEERED MY HEART. I STRAIGHTENED UP AND WAS ABOUT TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE THE CIGARETTE OF SATISFACTION WHEN AT THAT VERY MOMENT A LAUGH BURST OUT BEHIND ME. TAKEN BY SURPRISE I SUDDENLY WHEELED AROUND; THERE WAS NO ONE THERE. I STEPPED TO THE RAILING; NO BARGE OR BOAT. I TURNED BACK TOWARD THE ISLAND AND AGAIN HEARD THE LAUGHTER BEHIND ME A LITTLE FARTHER OFF AS IF IT WERE GOING DOWNSTREAM. I STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS. THE SOUND OF THE LAUGHTER WAS DECREASING BUT I COULD STILL HEAR IT DISTINCTLY BEHIND ME COME FROM NOWHERE UNLESS FROM THE WATER. AT THE SAME TIME I WAS AWARE OF THE RAPID BEATING OF MY HEART. PLEASE DON’T MISUNDERSTAND ME; THERE WAS NOTHING MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THAT LAUGH; IT WAS A GOOD HEARTY ALMOST FRIENDLY LAUGH WHICH RE-ESTABLISHED THE PROPER PROPORTIONS. SOON I HEARD NOTHING MORE ANYWAY. I RETURNED TO THE QUAYS WENT UP THE RUE DAUPHINE BOUGHT SOME CIGARETTES I DIDN’T NEED AT ALL. I WAS DAZED AND HAD TROUBLE BREATHING. THAT EVENING I RANG UP A FRIEND WHO WASN’T AT HOME. I WAS HESITATING ABOUT GOING OUT WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD LAUGHTER UNDER MY WINDOWS. I OPENED THEM. ON THE SIDEWALK IN FACT SOME YOUTHS WERE LOUDLY SAYING GOOD NIGHT. I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS AS I CLOSED THE WINDOWS; AFTER ALL I HAD A BRIEF TO STUDY. I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM TO DRINK A GLASS OF WATER. MY REFLECTION WAS SMILING IN THE MIRROR BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MY SMILE WAS DOUBLE …

WHAT? FORGIVE ME I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE. I’LL SEE YOU AGAIN TOMORROW PROBABLY. TOMORROW YES THAT’S RIGHT. NO NO I CAN’T STAY. BESIDES I AM CALLED IN CONSULTATION BY THAT BROWN BEAR OF A MAN YOU SEE OVER THERE. A DECENT FELLOW FOR SURE WHOM THE POLICE ARE MEANLY PERSECUTING OUT OF SHEER PERVERSITY. YOU THINK HE LOOKS LIKE A KILLER? REST ASSURED THAT HIS ACTIONS CONFORM TO HIS LOOKS. HE BURGLES LIKEWISE AND YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THAT CAVE MAN IS SPECIALIZED IN THE ART TRADE. IN HOLLAND EVERYONE IS A SPECIALIST IN PAINTINGS AND IN TULIPS. THIS ONE WITH HIS MODEST MIEN IS THE AUTHOR OF THE MOST FAMOUS THEFT OF A PAINTING. WHICH ONE? I MAY TELL YOU. DON’T BE SURPRISED AT MY KNOWLEDGE. ALTHOUGH I AM A JUDGE-PENITENT I HAVE MY SIDE LINE HERE: I AM THE LEGAL COUNSELOR OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE. I STUDIED THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY AND BUILT UP A CLIENTELE IN THIS QUARTER WHERE DIPLOMAS ARE NOT REQUIRED. IT WASN’T EASY BUT I INSPIRE CONFIDENCE DON’T I? I HAVE A GOOD HEARTY LAUGH AND AN ENERGETIC HANDSHAKE AND THOSE ARE TRUMP CARDS. BESIDES I SETTLED A FEW DIFFICULT CASES OUT OF SELF-INTEREST TO BEGIN WITH AND LATER OUT OF CONVICTION. IF PIMPS AND THIEVES WERE INVARIABLY SENTENCED ALL DECENT PEOPLE WOULD GET TO THINKING THEY THEMSELVES WERE CONSTANTLY INNOCENT CHER MONSIEUR. AND IN MY OPINION—ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT I’M COMING!—THAT’S WHAT MUST BE AVOIDED ABOVE ALL. OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WOULD BE JUST A JOKE.

REALLY MON CHER COMPATRIOTE I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR CURIOSITY. HOWEVER THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT MY STORY. SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED I’LL TELL YOU THAT I THOUGHT A LITTLE ABOUT THAT LAUGH FOR A FEW DAYS THEN FORGOT ABOUT IT. ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE I SEEMED TO HEAR IT WITHIN ME. BUT MOST OF THE TIME WITHOUT MAKING ANY EFFORT I THOUGHT OF OTHER THINGS.

YET I MUST ADMIT THAT I CEASED TO WALK ALONG THE PARIS QUAYS. WHEN I WOULD RIDE ALONG THEM IN A CAR OR BUS A SORT OF SILENCE WOULD DESCEND ON ME. I WAS WAITING I BELIEVE. BUT I WOULD CROSS THE SEINE NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN AND I WOULD BREATHE AGAIN. I ALSO HAD SOME HEALTH PROBLEMS AT THAT TIME. NOTHING DEFINITE A DEJECTION PERHAPS A SORT OF DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING MY GOOD SPIRITS. I SAW DOCTORS WHO GAVE ME STIMULANTS. I WAS ALTERNATELY STIMULATED AND DEPRESSED. LIFE BECAME LESS EASY FOR ME: WHEN THE BODY IS SAD THE HEART LANGUISHES. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS HALF UNLEARNING WHAT I HAD NEVER LEARNED AND YET KNEW SO WELL—HOW TO LIVE. YES I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY THEN THAT EVERYTHING BEGAN.

BUT THIS EVENING I DON’T FEEL QUITE UP TO SNUFF EITHER. I EVEN FIND TROUBLE EXPRESSING MYSELF. I’M NOT TALKING SO WELL IT SEEMS TO ME AND MY WORDS ARE LESS ASSURED. PROBABLY THE WEATHER. IT’S HARD TO BREATHE; THE AIR IS SO HEAVY IT WEIGHS ON ONE’S CHEST. WOULD YOU OBJECT MON CHER COMPATRIOTE TO GOING OUT AND WALKING IN THE TOWN A LITTLE? THANK YOU.

HOW BEAUTIFUL THE CANALS ARE THIS EVENING! I LIKE THE BREATH OF STAGNANT WATERS THE SMELL OF DEAD LEAVES SOAKING IN THE CANAL AND THE FUNEREAL SCENT RISING FROM THE BARGES LOADED WITH FLOWERS. NO NO THERE’S NOTHING MORBID ABOUT SUCH A TASTE I ASSURE YOU. ON THE CONTRARY IT’S DELIBERATE WITH ME. THE TRUTH IS THAT I FORCE MYSELF TO ADMIRE THESE CANALS. WHAT I LIKE MOST IN THE WORLD IS SICILY YOU SEE AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE TOP OF ETNA IN THE SUNLIGHT PROVIDED I DOMINATE THE ISLAND AND THE SEA. JAVA TOO BUT AT THE TIME OF THE TRADE WINDS. YES I WENT THERE IN MY YOUTH. IN A GENERAL WAY I LIKE ALL ISLANDS. IT IS EASIER TO DOMINATE THEM.

CHARMING HOUSE ISN’T IT? THE TWO HEADS YOU SEE UP THERE ARE HEADS OF NEGRO SLAVES. A SHOP SIGN. THE HOUSE BELONGED TO A SLAVE DEALER. OH THEY WEREN’T SQUEAMISH IN THOSE DAYS! THEY HAD ASSURANCE; THEY ANNOUNCED: “YOU SEE I’M A MAN OF SUBSTANCE; I’M IN THE SLAVE TRADE; I DEAL IN BLACK FLESH.” CAN YOU IMAGINE ANYONE TODAY MAKING IT KNOWN PUBLICLY THAT SUCH IS HIS BUSINESS? WHAT A SCANDAL! I CAN HEAR MY PARISIAN COLLEAGUES RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE ADAMANT ON THE SUBJECT; THEY WOULDN’T HESITATE TO LAUNCH TWO OR THREE MANIFESTOES MAYBE EVEN MORE! AND ON REFLECTION I’D ADD MY SIGNATURE TO THEIRS. SLAVERY?—CERTAINLY NOT WE ARE AGAINST IT! THAT WE SHOULD BE FORCED TO ESTABLISH IT AT HOME OR IN OUR FACTORIES—WELL THAT’S NATURAL; BUT BOASTING ABOUT IT THAT’S THE LIMIT!

I AM WELL AWARE THAT ONE CAN’T GET ALONG WITHOUT DOMINEERING OR BEING SERVED. EVERY MAN NEEDS SLAVES AS HE NEEDS FRESH AIR. COMMANDING IS BREATHING—YOU AGREE WITH ME? AND EVEN THE MOST DESTITUTE MANAGE TO BREATHE. THE LOWEST MAN IN THE SOCIAL SCALE STILL HAS HIS WIFE OR HIS CHILD. IF HE’S UNMARRIED A DOG. THE ESSENTIAL THING AFTER ALL IS BEING ABLE TO GET ANGRY WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO TALK BACK. “ONE DOESN’T TALK BACK TO ONE’S FATHER”—YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION? IN ONE WAY IT IS VERY ODD. TO WHOM SHOULD ONE TALK BACK IN THIS WORLD IF NOT TO WHAT ONE LOVES? IN ANOTHER WAY IT IS CONVINCING. SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE THE LAST WORD. OTHERWISE EVERY REASON CAN BE ANSWERED WITH ANOTHER ONE AND THERE WOULD NEVER BE AN END TO IT. POWER ON THE OTHER HAND SETTLES EVERYTHING. IT TOOK TIME BUT WE FINALLY REALIZED THAT. FOR INSTANCE YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED THAT OUR OLD EUROPE AT LAST PHILOSOPHIZES IN THE RIGHT WAY. WE NO LONGER SAY AS IN SIMPLE TIMES: “THIS IS THE WAY I THINK. WHAT ARE YOUR OBJECTIONS?” WE HAVE BECOME LUCID. FOR THE DIALOGUE WE HAVE SUBSTITUTED THE COMMUNIQUÉ: “THIS IS THE TRUTH” WE SAY. “YOU CAN DISCUSS IT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT; WE AREN’T INTERESTED. BUT IN A FEW YEARS THERE’LL BE THE POLICE WHO WILL SHOW YOU WE ARE RIGHT.”

AH THIS DEAR OLD PLANET! ALL IS CLEAR NOW. WE KNOW OURSELVES; WE NOW KNOW OF WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE. JUST TAKE ME TO CHANGE EXAMPLES IF NOT SUBJECTS I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE SERVED WITH A SMILE. IF THE MAID LOOKED SAD SHE POISONED MY DAYS. SHE HAD A RIGHT NOT TO BE CHEERFUL TO BE SURE. BUT I TOLD MYSELF THAT IT WAS BETTER FOR HER TO PERFORM HER SERVICE WITH A LAUGH THAN WITH TEARS. IN FACT IT WAS BETTER FOR ME. YET WITHOUT BOASTING MY REASONING WAS NOT ALTOGETHER IDIOTIC. LIKEWISE I ALWAYS REFUSED TO EAT IN CHINESE RESTAURANTS. WHY? BECAUSE ORIENTALS WHEN THEY ARE SILENT AND IN THE PRESENCE OF WHITES OFTEN LOOK SCORNFUL. NATURALLY THEY KEEP THAT LOOK WHEN SERVING. HOW THEN CAN YOU ENJOY THE GLAZED CHICKEN? AND ABOVE ALL HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT THEM AND THINK YOU ARE RIGHT?

JUST BETWEEN US SLAVERY PREFERABLY WITH A SMILE IS INEVITABLE THEN. BUT WE MUST NOT ADMIT IT. ISN’T IT BETTER THAT WHOEVER CANNOT DO WITHOUT HAVING SLAVES SHOULD CALL THEM FREE MEN? FOR THE PRINCIPLE TO BEGIN WITH AND SECONDLY NOT TO DRIVE THEM TO DESPAIR. WE OWE THEM THAT COMPENSATION DON’T WE? IN THAT WAY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SMILE AND WE SHALL MAINTAIN OUR GOOD CONSCIENCE. OTHERWISE WE’D BE OBLIGED TO RECONSIDER OUR OPINION OF OURSELVES; WE’D GO MAD WITH SUFFERING OR EVEN BECOME MODEST—FOR EVERYTHING WOULD BE POSSIBLE. CONSEQUENTLY NO SHOP SIGNS AND THIS ONE IS SHOCKING. BESIDES IF EVERYONE TOLD ALL DISPLAYED HIS TRUE PROFESSION AND IDENTITY WE SHOULDN’T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN! IMAGINE THE VISITING CARDS: DUPONT JITTERY PHILOSOPHER OR CHRISTIAN LANDOWNER OR ADULTEROUS HUMANIST—INDEED THERE’S A WIDE CHOICE. BUT IT WOULD BE HELL! YES HELL MUST BE LIKE THAT: STREETS FILLED WITH SHOP SIGNS AND NO WAY OF EXPLAINING ONESELF. ONE IS CLASSIFIED ONCE AND FOR ALL.

YOU FOR INSTANCE MON CHER COMPATRIOTE STOP AND THINK OF WHAT YOUR SIGN WOULD BE. YOU ARE SILENT? WELL YOU’LL TELL ME LATER ON. I KNOW MINE IN ANY CASE: A DOUBLE FACE A CHARMING JANUS AND ABOVE IT THE MOTTO OF THE HOUSE: “DON’T RELY ON IT.” ON MY CARDS: “JEAN-BAPTISTE CLAMENCE PLAY ACTOR.” WHY SHORTLY AFTER THE EVENING I TOLD YOU ABOUT I DISCOVERED SOMETHING. WHEN I WOULD LEAVE A BLIND MAN ON THE SIDEWALK TO WHICH I HAD CONVOYED HIM I USED TO TIP MY HAT TO HIM. OBVIOUSLY THE HAT TIPPING WASN’T INTENDED FOR HIM SINCE HE COULDN’T SEE IT. TO WHOM WAS IT ADDRESSED? TO THE PUBLIC. AFTER PLAYING MY PART I WOULD TAKE THE BOW. NOT BAD EH? ANOTHER DAY DURING THE SAME PERIOD TO A MOTORIST WHO WAS THANKING ME FOR HELPING HIM I REPLIED THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE DONE AS MUCH. I MEANT OF COURSE ANYONE. BUT THAT UNFORTUNATE SLIP WEIGHED HEAVY ON ME. FOR MODESTY REALLY I TOOK THE CAKE.

I HAVE TO ADMIT IT HUMBLY MON CHER COMPATRIOTE I WAS ALWAYS BURSTING WITH VANITY. I I I IS THE REFRAIN OF MY WHOLE LIFE WHICH COULD BE HEARD IN EVERYTHING I SAID. I COULD NEVER TALK WITHOUT BOASTING ESPECIALLY IF I DID SO WITH THAT SHATTERING DISCRETION THAT WAS MY SPECIALTY. IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT I ALWAYS LIVED FREE AND POWERFUL. I SIMPLY FELT RELEASED IN REGARD TO ALL FOR THE EXCELLENT REASON THAT I RECOGNIZED NO EQUALS. I ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF MORE INTELLIGENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE AS I’VE TOLD YOU BUT ALSO MORE SENSITIVE AND MORE SKILLFUL A CRACK SHOT AN INCOMPARABLE DRIVER A BETTER LOVER. EVEN IN THE FIELDS IN WHICH IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO VERIFY MY INFERIORITY—LIKE TENNIS FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH I WAS BUT A PASSABLE PARTNER—IT WAS HARD FOR ME NOT TO THINK THAT WITH A LITTLE TIME FOR PRACTICE I WOULD SURPASS THE BEST PLAYERS. I ADMITTED ONLY SUPERIORITIES IN ME AND THIS EXPLAINED MY GOOD WILL AND SERENITY. WHEN I WAS CONCERNED WITH OTHERS I WAS SO OUT OF PURE CONDESCENSION IN UTTER FREEDOM AND ALL THE CREDIT WENT TO ME: MY SELF-ESTEEM WOULD GO UP A DEGREE.

ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER TRUTHS I DISCOVERED THESE FACTS LITTLE BY LITTLE IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE EVENING I TOLD YOU ABOUT. NOT ALL AT ONCE NOR VERY CLEARLY. FIRST I HAD TO RECOVER MY MEMORY. BY GRADUAL DEGREES I SAW MORE CLEARLY I LEARNED A LITTLE OF WHAT I KNEW. UNTIL THEN I HAD ALWAYS BEEN AIDED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO FORGET. I USED TO FORGET EVERYTHING BEGINNING WITH MY RESOLUTIONS. FUNDAMENTALLY NOTHING MATTERED. WAR SUICIDE LOVE POVERTY GOT MY ATTENTION OF COURSE WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED ME BUT A COURTEOUS SUPERFICIAL ATTENTION. AT TIMES I WOULD PRETEND TO GET EXCITED ABOUT SOME CAUSE FOREIGN TO MY DAILY LIFE. BUT BASICALLY I DIDN’T REALLY TAKE PART IN IT EXCEPT OF COURSE WHEN MY FREEDOM WAS THWARTED. HOW CAN I EXPRESS IT? EVERYTHING SLID OFF—YES JUST ROLLED OFF ME.

IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT SOMETIMES MY FORGETFULNESS WAS PRAISEWORTHY. YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOSE RELIGION CONSISTS IN FORGIVING ALL OFFENSES AND WHO DO IN FACT FORGIVE THEM BUT NEVER FORGET THEM? I WASN’T GOOD ENOUGH TO FORGIVE OFFENSES BUT EVENTUALLY I ALWAYS FORGOT THEM. AND THE MAN WHO THOUGHT I HATED HIM COULDN’T GET OVER SEEING ME TIP MY HAT TO HIM WITH A SMILE. ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE HE WOULD THEN ADMIRE MY NOBILITY OF CHARACTER OR SCORN MY ILL BREEDING WITHOUT REALIZING THAT MY REASON WAS SIMPLER: I HAD FORGOTTEN HIS VERY NAME. THE SAME INFIRMITY THAT OFTEN MADE ME INDIFFERENT OR UNGRATEFUL IN SUCH CASES MADE ME MAGNANIMOUS.

I LIVED CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT ANY OTHER CONTINUITY THAN THAT FROM DAY TO DAY OF I I I. FROM DAY TO DAY WOMEN FROM DAY TO DAY VIRTUE OR VICE FROM DAY TO DAY LIKE DOGS—BUT EVERY DAY MYSELF SECURE AT MY POST. THUS I PROGRESSED ON THE SURFACE OF LIFE IN THE REALM OF WORDS AS IT WERE NEVER IN REALITY. ALL THOSE BOOKS BARELY READ THOSE FRIENDS BARELY LOVED THOSE CITIES BARELY VISITED THOSE WOMEN BARELY POSSESSED! I WENT THROUGH THE GESTURES OUT OF BOREDOM OR ABSENT-MINDEDNESS. THEN CAME HUMAN BEINGS; THEY WANTED TO CLING BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO CLING TO AND THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE—FOR THEM. AS FOR ME I FORGOT. I NEVER REMEMBERED ANYTHING BUT MYSELF.

GRADUALLY HOWEVER MY MEMORY RETURNED. OR RATHER I RETURNED TO IT AND IN IT I FOUND THE RECOLLECTION THAT WAS AWAITING ME. BUT BEFORE TELLING YOU OF IT ALLOW ME MON CHER COMPATRIOTE TO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES (THEY WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU I AM SURE) OF WHAT I DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATION.

ONE DAY IN MY CAR WHEN I WAS SLOW IN MAKING A GETAWAY AT THE GREEN LIGHT WHILE OUR PATIENT FELLOW CITIZENS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN HONKING FURIOUSLY BEHIND ME I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED ANOTHER OCCASION SET IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. A MOTORCYCLE RIDDEN BY A SPARE LITTLE MAN WEARING SPECTACLES AND PLUS FOURS HAD GONE AROUND ME AND PLANTED ITSELF IN FRONT OF ME AT THE RED LIGHT. AS HE CAME TO A STOP THE LITTLE MAN HAD STALLED HIS MOTOR AND WAS VAINLY STRIVING TO REVIVE IT. WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED I ASKED HIM WITH MY USUAL COURTESY TO TAKE HIS MOTORCYCLE OUT OF MY WAY SO I MIGHT PASS. THE LITTLE MAN WAS GETTING IRRITABLE OVER HIS WHEEZY MOTOR. HENCE HE REPLIED ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF PARISIAN COURTESY THAT I COULD GO CLIMB A TREE. I INSISTED STILL POLITE BUT WITH A SLIGHT SHADE OF IMPATIENCE IN MY VOICE. I WAS IMMEDIATELY TOLD THAT IN ANY CASE I COULD GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. MEANWHILE SEVERAL HORNS BEGAN TO BE HEARD BEHIND ME. WITH GREATER FIRMNESS I BEGGED MY INTERLOCUTOR TO BE POLITE AND TO REALIZE THAT HE WAS BLOCKING TRAFFIC. THE IRASCIBLE CHARACTER PROBABLY EXASPERATED BY THE NOW EVIDENT ILL WILL OF HIS MOTOR INFORMED ME THAT IF I WANTED WHAT HE CALLED A THOROUGH DUSTING OFF HE WOULD GLADLY GIVE IT TO ME. SUCH CYNICISM FILLED ME WITH A HEALTHY RAGE AND I GOT OUT OF MY CAR WITH THE INTENTION OF THRASHING THIS COARSE INDIVIDUAL. I DON’T THINK I AM COWARDLY (BUT WHAT DOESN’T ONE THINK!); I WAS A HEAD TALLER THAN MY ADVERSARY AND MY MUSCLES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RELIABLE. I STILL BELIEVE THE DUSTING OFF WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED RATHER THAN GIVEN. BUT I HAD HARDLY SET FOOT ON THE PAVEMENT WHEN FROM THE GATHERING CROWD A MAN STEPPED FORTH RUSHED AT ME ASSURED ME THAT I WAS THE LOWEST OF THE LOW AND THAT HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO STRIKE A MAN WHO HAD A MOTORCYCLE BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND HENCE WAS AT A DISADVANTAGE. I TURNED TOWARD THIS MUSKETEER AND IN TRUTH DIDN’T EVEN SEE HIM. INDEED HARDLY HAD I TURNED MY HEAD WHEN ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY I HEARD THE MOTORCYCLE BEGIN POPPING AGAIN AND RECEIVED A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE EAR. BEFORE I HAD THE TIME TO REGISTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE MOTORCYCLE RODE AWAY. DAZED I MECHANICALLY WALKED TOWARD D’ARTAGNAN WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT AN EXASPERATED CONCERT OF HORNS ROSE FROM THE NOW CONSIDERABLE LINE OF VEHICLES. THE LIGHT WAS CHANGING TO GREEN. THEN STILL SOMEWHAT BEWILDERED INSTEAD OF GIVING A DRUBBING TO THE IDIOT WHO HAD ADDRESSED ME I DOCILELY RETURNED TO MY CAR AND DROVE OFF. AS I PASSED THE IDIOT GREETED ME WITH A “POOR DOPE” THAT I STILL RECALL.

A TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT STORY IN YOUR OPINION? PROBABLY. STILL IT TOOK ME SOME TIME TO FORGET IT AND THAT’S WHAT COUNTS. YET I HAD EXCUSES. I HAD LET MYSELF BE BEATEN WITHOUT REPLYING BUT I COULD NOT BE ACCUSED OF COWARDICE. TAKEN BY SURPRISE ADDRESSED FROM BOTH SIDES I HAD MIXED EVERYTHING UP AND THE HORNS HAD PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH TO MY EMBARRASSMENT. YET I WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS AS IF I HAD VIOLATED THE CODE OF HONOR. I COULD SEE MYSELF GETTING BACK INTO MY CAR WITHOUT A REACTION UNDER THE IRONIC GAZE OF A CROWD ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED BECAUSE AS I RECALL I WAS WEARING A VERY ELEGANT BLUE SUIT. I COULD HEAR THE “POOR DOPE” WHICH IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING STRUCK ME AS JUSTIFIED. IN SHORT I HAD COLLAPSED IN PUBLIC. AS A RESULT OF A SERIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE SURE BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS CIRCUMSTANCES. AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT I CLEARLY SAW WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE. I SAW MYSELF FELLING D’ARTAGNAN WITH A GOOD HOOK TO THE JAW GETTING BACK INTO MY CAR PURSUING THE MONKEY WHO HAD STRUCK ME OVERTAKING HIM JAMMING HIS MACHINE AGAINST THE CURB TAKING HIM ASIDE AND GIVING HIM THE LICKING HE HAD FULLY DESERVED. WITH A FEW VARIANTS I RAN OFF THIS LITTLE FILM A HUNDRED TIMES IN MY IMAGINATION. BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS I CHEWED A BITTER RESENTMENT.

WHY IT’S RAINING AGAIN. LET’S STOP SHALL WE UNDER THIS PORTICO? GOOD. WHERE WAS I? OH YES HONOR! WELL WHEN I RECOVERED THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT EPISODE I REALIZED WHAT IT MEANT. AFTER ALL MY DREAM HAD NOT STOOD UP TO FACTS. I HAD DREAMED—THIS WAS NOW CLEAR—OF BEING A COMPLETE MAN WHO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF RESPECTED IN HIS PERSON AS WELL AS IN HIS PROFESSION. HALF CERDAN HALF DE GAULLE IF YOU WILL. IN SHORT I WANTED TO DOMINATE IN ALL THINGS. THIS IS WHY I ASSUMED THE MANNER MADE A PARTICULAR POINT OF DISPLAYING MY PHYSICAL SKILL RATHER THAN MY INTELLECTUAL GIFTS. BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN STRUCK IN PUBLIC WITHOUT REACTING IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR ME TO CHERISH THAT FINE PICTURE OF MYSELF. IF I HAD BEEN THE FRIEND OF TRUTH AND INTELLIGENCE I CLAIMED TO BE WHAT WOULD THAT EPISODE HAVE MATTERED TO ME? IT WAS ALREADY FORGOTTEN BY THOSE WHO HAD WITNESSED IT. I’D HAVE BARELY ACCUSED MYSELF OF HAVING GOT ANGRY OVER NOTHING AND ALSO HAVING GOT ANGRY OF NOT HAVING MANAGED TO FACE UP TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ANGER FOR WANT OF PRESENCE OF MIND. INSTEAD OF THAT I WAS EAGER TO GET MY REVENGE TO STRIKE AND CONQUER. AS IF MY TRUE DESIRE WERE NOT TO BE THE MOST INTELLIGENT OR MOST GENEROUS CREATURE ON EARTH BUT ONLY TO BEAT ANYONE I WANTED TO BE THE STRONGER IN SHORT AND IN THE MOST ELEMENTARY WAY. THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY INTELLIGENT MAN AS YOU KNOW DREAMS OF BEING A GANGSTER AND OF RULING OVER SOCIETY BY FORCE ALONE. AS IT IS NOT SO EASY AS THE DETECTIVE NOVELS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE ONE GENERALLY RELIES ON POLITICS AND JOINS THE CRUELEST PARTY. WHAT DOES IT MATTER AFTER ALL IF BY HUMILIATING ONE’S MIND ONE SUCCEEDS IN DOMINATING EVERYONE? I DISCOVERED IN MYSELF SWEET DREAMS OF OPPRESSION.

I LEARNED AT LEAST THAT I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE GUILTY THE ACCUSED ONLY IN EXACTLY SO FAR AS THEIR CRIME CAUSED ME NO HARM. THEIR GUILT MADE ME ELOQUENT BECAUSE I WAS NOT ITS VICTIM. WHEN I WAS THREATENED I BECAME NOT ONLY A JUDGE IN TURN BUT EVEN MORE: AN IRASCIBLE MASTER WHO WANTED REGARDLESS OF ALL LAWS TO STRIKE DOWN THE OFFENDER AND GET HIM ON HIS KNEES. AFTER THAT MON CHER COMPATRIOTE IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTINUE SERIOUSLY BELIEVING ONE HAS A VOCATION FOR JUSTICE AND IS THE PREDESTINED DEFENDER OF THE WIDOW AND ORPHAN.

SINCE THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN HARDER AND WE HAVE THE TIME MAY I IMPART TO YOU ANOTHER DISCOVERY I MADE SOON AFTER IN MY MEMORY? LET’S SIT DOWN ON THIS BENCH OUT OF THE RAIN. FOR CENTURIES PIPE SMOKERS HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE SAME RAIN FALLING ON THE SAME CANAL. WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS A BIT MORE DIFFICULT. THIS TIME IT CONCERNS A WOMAN. TO BEGIN WITH YOU MUST KNOW THAT I ALWAYS SUCCEEDED WITH WOMEN—AND WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. I DON’T SAY SUCCEED IN MAKING THEM HAPPY OR EVEN IN MAKING MYSELF HAPPY THROUGH THEM. NO SIMPLY SUCCEED. I USED TO ACHIEVE MY ENDS JUST ABOUT WHENEVER I WANTED. I WAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE CHARM. FANCY THAT! YOU KNOW WHAT CHARM IS: A WAY OF GETTING THE ANSWER YES WITHOUT HAVING ASKED ANY CLEAR QUESTION. AND THAT WAS TRUE OF ME AT THE TIME. DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU? COME NOW DON’T DENY IT. WITH THE FACE I NOW HAVE THAT’S QUITE NATURAL. ALAS AFTER A CERTAIN AGE EVERY MAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FACE. MINE … BUT WHAT MATTER? IT’S A FACT—I WAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE CHARM AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT.

WITHOUT CALCULATION HOWEVER; I WAS IN GOOD FAITH OR ALMOST. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN WAS NATURAL FREE EASY AS THE SAYING GOES. NO GUILE IN IT EXCEPT THAT OBVIOUS GUILE WHICH THEY LOOK UPON AS A HOMAGE. I LOVED THEM ACCORDING TO THE HALLOWED EXPRESSION WHICH AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT I NEVER LOVED ANY OF THEM. I ALWAYS CONSIDERED MISOGYNY VULGAR AND STUPID AND ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN I HAVE KNOWN SEEMED TO ME BETTER THAN I. NEVERTHELESS SETTING THEM SO HIGH I MADE USE OF THEM MORE OFTEN THAN I SERVED THEM. HOW CAN ONE MAKE IT OUT?

OF COURSE TRUE LOVE IS EXCEPTIONAL—TWO OR THREE TIMES A CENTURY MORE OR LESS. THE REST OF THE TIME THERE IS VANITY OR BOREDOM. AS FOR ME IN ANY CASE I WAS NOT THE PORTUGUESE NUN. I AM NOT HARD-HEARTED; FAR FROM IT—FULL OF PITY ON THE CONTRARY AND WITH A READY TEAR TO BOOT. ONLY MY EMOTIONAL IMPULSES ALWAYS TURN TOWARD ME MY FEELINGS OF PITY CONCERN ME. IT IS NOT TRUE AFTER ALL THAT I NEVER LOVED. I CONCEIVED AT LEAST ONE GREAT LOVE IN MY LIFE OF WHICH I WAS ALWAYS THE OBJECT. FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW AFTER THE INEVITABLE HARDSHIPS OF YOUTH I WAS EARLY FOCUSED: SENSUALITY ALONE DOMINATED MY LOVE LIFE. I LOOKED MERELY FOR OBJECTS OF PLEASURE AND CONQUEST. MOREOVER I WAS AIDED IN THIS BY MY CONSTITUTION: NATURE HAD BEEN GENEROUS WITH ME. I WAS CONSIDERABLY PROUD OF THIS AND DERIVED MANY SATISFACTIONS THEREFROM—WITHOUT MY KNOWING NOW WHETHER THEY WERE PHYSICAL OR BASED ON PRESTIGE. OF COURSE YOU WILL SAY THAT I AM BOASTING AGAIN. I SHAN’T DENY IT AND I AM HARDLY PROUD OF DOING SO FOR HERE I AM BOASTING OF WHAT IS TRUE.

IN ANY CASE MY SENSUALITY (TO LIMIT MYSELF TO IT) WAS SO REAL THAT EVEN FOR A TEN-MINUTE ADVENTURE I’D HAVE DISOWNED FATHER AND MOTHER EVEN WERE I TO REGRET IT BITTERLY. INDEED—ESPECIALLY FOR A TEN-MINUTE ADVENTURE AND EVEN MORE SO IF I WERE SURE IT WAS TO HAVE NO SEQUEL. I HAD PRINCIPLES TO BE SURE SUCH AS THAT THE WIFE OF A FRIEND IS SACRED. BUT I SIMPLY CEASED QUITE SINCERELY A FEW DAYS BEFORE TO FEEL ANY FRIENDSHIP FOR THE HUSBAND. MAYBE I OUGHT NOT TO CALL THIS SENSUALITY? SENSUALITY IS NOT REPULSIVE. LET’S BE INDULGENT AND USE THE WORD “INFIRMITY” A SORT OF CONGENITAL INABILITY TO SEE IN LOVE ANYTHING BUT THE PHYSICAL. THAT INFIRMITY AFTER ALL WAS CONVENIENT. COMBINED WITH MY FACULTY FOR FORGETTING IT FAVORED MY FREEDOM. AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH A CERTAIN APPEARANCE OF INACCESSIBILITY AND UNSHAKABLE INDEPENDENCE IT GAVE ME IT PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW SUCCESSES. AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING ROMANTIC I GAVE ROMANCE SOMETHING TO WORK ON. OUR FEMININE FRIENDS HAVE IN COMMON WITH BONAPARTE THE BELIEF THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED WHERE EVERYONE ELSE HAS FAILED.

IN THIS EXCHANGE MOREOVER I SATISFIED SOMETHING IN ADDITION TO MY SENSUALITY: MY PASSION FOR GAMBLING. I LOVED IN WOMEN MY PARTNERS IN A CERTAIN GAME WHICH HAD AT LEAST THE TASTE OF INNOCENCE. YOU SEE I CAN’T ENDURE BEING BORED AND APPRECIATE ONLY DIVERSIONS IN LIFE. ANY SOCIETY HOWEVER BRILLIANT SOON CRUSHES ME WHEREAS I HAVE NEVER BEEN BORED WITH THE WOMEN I LIKED. IT HURTS ME TO CONFESS IT BUT I’D HAVE GIVEN TEN CONVERSATIONS WITH EINSTEIN FOR AN INITIAL RENDEZVOUS WITH A PRETTY CHORUS GIRL. IT’S TRUE THAT AT THE TENTH RENDEZVOUS I WAS LONGING FOR EINSTEIN OR A SERIOUS BOOK. IN SHORT I WAS NEVER CONCERNED WITH THE MAJOR PROBLEMS EXCEPT IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN MY LITTLE EXCESSES. AND HOW OFTEN STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK INVOLVED IN A PASSIONATE DISCUSSION WITH FRIENDS I LOST THE THREAD OF THE ARGUMENT BEING DEVELOPED BECAUSE A DEVASTATING WOMAN WAS CROSSING THE STREET AT THAT VERY MOMENT.

HENCE I PLAYED THE GAME. I KNEW THEY DIDN’T LIKE ONE TO REVEAL ONE’S PURPOSE TOO QUICKLY. FIRST THERE HAD TO BE CONVERSATION FOND ATTENTIONS AS THEY SAY. I WASN’T WORRIED ABOUT SPEECHES BEING A LAWYER NOR ABOUT GLANCES HAVING BEEN AN AMATEUR ACTOR DURING MY MILITARY SERVICE. I OFTEN CHANGED PARTS BUT IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME PLAY. FOR INSTANCE THE SCENE OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE ATTRACTION OF THE “MYSTERIOUS SOMETHING” OF THE “IT’S UNREASONABLE I CERTAINLY DIDN’T WANT TO BE ATTRACTED I WAS EVEN TIRED OF LOVE ETC.…” ALWAYS WORKED THOUGH IT IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE REPERTORY. THERE WAS ALSO THE GAMBIT OF THE MYSTERIOUS HAPPINESS NO OTHER WOMAN HAS EVER GIVEN YOU; IT MAY BE A BLIND ALLEY—INDEED IT SURELY IS (FOR ONE CANNOT PROTECT ONESELF TOO MUCH)—BUT IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE UNIQUE. ABOVE ALL I HAD PERFECTED A LITTLE SPEECH WHICH WAS ALWAYS WELL RECEIVED AND WHICH I AM SURE YOU WILL APPLAUD. THE ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT ACT LAY IN THE ASSERTION PAINFUL AND RESIGNED THAT I WAS NOTHING THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH GETTING INVOLVED WITH ME THAT MY LIFE WAS ELSEWHERE AND NOT RELATED TO EVERYDAY HAPPINESS—A HAPPINESS THAT MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING BUT THERE YOU WERE IT WAS TOO LATE. AS TO THE REASONS BEHIND THIS DECISIVE LATENESS I MAINTAINED SECRECY KNOWING THAT IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO GO TO BED WITH A MYSTERY. IN A WAY MOREOVER I BELIEVED WHAT I SAID; I WAS LIVING MY PART. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MY PARTNERS LIKEWISE BEGAN TO “TREAD THE BOARDS” ENTHUSIASTICALLY. THE MOST SENSITIVE AMONG THEM TRIED TO UNDERSTAND ME AND THAT EFFORT LED THEM TO MELANCHOLY SURRENDERS. THE OTHERS SATISFIED TO NOTE THAT I WAS RESPECTING THE RULES OF THE GAME AND HAD THE TACTFULNESS TO TALK BEFORE ACTING PROGRESSED WITHOUT DELAY TO THE REALITIES. THIS MEANT I HAD WON—AND TWICE OVER SINCE BESIDES THE DESIRE I FELT FOR THEM I WAS SATISFYING THE LOVE I BORE MYSELF BY VERIFYING EACH TIME MY SPECIAL POWERS.

THIS IS SO TRUE THAT EVEN IF SOME AMONG THEM PROVIDED BUT SLIGHT PLEASURE I NEVERTHELESS TRIED TO RESUME RELATIONS WITH THEM AT LONG INTERVALS HELPED DOUBTLESS BY THAT STRANGE DESIRE KINDLED BY ABSENCE AND A SUDDENLY RECOVERED COMPLICITY BUT ALSO TO VERIFY THE FACT THAT OUR TIES STILL HELD AND THAT IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE ALONE TO TIGHTEN THEM. SOMETIMES I WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE THEM SWEAR NOT TO GIVE THEMSELVES TO ANY OTHER MAN IN ORDER TO QUIET MY WORRIES ONCE AND FOR ALL ON THAT SCORE. MY HEART HOWEVER PLAYED NO PART IN THAT WORRY NOR EVEN MY IMAGINATION. A CERTAIN TYPE OF PRETENSION WAS IN FACT SO PERSONIFIED IN ME THAT IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE DESPITE THE FACTS THAT A WOMAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN MINE COULD EVER BELONG TO ANOTHER. BUT THE OATH THEY SWORE TO ME LIBERATED ME WHILE IT BOUND THEM. AS SOON AS I KNEW THEY WOULD NEVER BELONG TO ANYONE I COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BREAK OFF—WHICH OTHERWISE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME. AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED I HAD PROVED MY POINT ONCE AND FOR ALL AND ASSURED MY POWER FOR A LONG TIME. STRANGE ISN’T IT? BUT THAT’S THE WAY IT WAS MON CHER COMPATRIOTE. SOME CRY: “LOVE ME!” OTHERS: “DON’T LOVE ME!” BUT A CERTAIN GENUS THE WORST AND MOST UNHAPPY CRIES: “DON’T LOVE ME AND BE FAITHFUL TO ME!”

EXCEPT THAT THE PROOF IS NEVER DEFINITIVE AFTER ALL; ONE HAS TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH EACH NEW PERSON. AS A RESULT OF BEGINNING OVER AND OVER AGAIN ONE GETS IN THE HABIT. SOON THE SPEECH COMES WITHOUT THINKING AND THE REFLEX FOLLOWS; AND ONE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF TAKING WITHOUT REALLY DESIRING. BELIEVE ME FOR CERTAIN MEN AT LEAST NOT TAKING WHAT ONE DOESN’T DESIRE IS THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED EVENTUALLY AND THERE’S NO POINT IN TELLING YOU WHO SHE WAS EXCEPT THAT WITHOUT REALLY STIRRING ME SHE HAD ATTRACTED ME BY HER PASSIVE AVID MANNER. FRANKLY IT WAS A SHABBY EXPERIENCE AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED. BUT I NEVER HAD ANY COMPLEXES AND SOON FORGOT THE PERSON WHOM I DIDN’T SEE AGAIN. I THOUGHT SHE HADN’T NOTICED ANYTHING AND DIDN’T EVEN IMAGINE SHE COULD HAVE AN OPINION. BESIDES IN MY EYES HER PASSIVE MANNER CUT HER OFF FROM THE WORLD. A FEW WEEKS LATER HOWEVER I LEARNED THAT SHE HAD RELATED MY DEFICIENCIES TO A THIRD PERSON. AT ONCE I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT DECEIVED; SHE WASN’T SO PASSIVE AS I HAD THOUGHT AND SHE DIDN’T LACK JUDGMENT. THEN I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS AND PRETENDED TO LAUGH. I EVEN LAUGHED OUTRIGHT; CLEARLY THE INCIDENT WAS UNIMPORTANT. IF THERE IS ANY REALM IN WHICH MODESTY OUGHT TO BE THE RULE ISN’T IT SEX WITH ALL THE UNFORESEEABLE THERE IS IN IT? BUT NO EACH OF US TRIES TO SHOW UP TO ADVANTAGE EVEN IN SOLITUDE. DESPITE HAVING SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS WHAT WAS MY BEHAVIOR IN FACT? I SAW THAT WOMAN AGAIN A LITTLE LATER AND DID EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO CHARM HER AND REALLY TAKE HER BACK. IT WAS NOT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEY DON’T LIKE EITHER TO END ON A FAILURE. FROM THAT MOMENT ONWARD WITHOUT REALLY INTENDING IT I BEGAN IN FACT TO MORTIFY HER IN EVERY WAY. I WOULD GIVE HER UP AND TAKE HER BACK FORCE HER TO GIVE HERSELF AT INAPPROPRIATE TIMES AND IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES TREAT HER SO BRUTALLY IN EVERY REGARD THAT EVENTUALLY I ATTACHED MYSELF TO HER AS I IMAGINE THE JAILER IS BOUND TO HIS PRISONER. AND THIS KEPT UP TILL THE DAY WHEN IN THE VIOLENT DISORDER OF PAINFUL AND CONSTRAINED PLEASURE SHE PAID A TRIBUTE ALOUD TO WHAT WAS ENSLAVING HER. THAT VERY DAY I BEGAN TO MOVE AWAY FROM HER. I HAVE FORGOTTEN HER SINCE.

I’LL AGREE WITH YOU DESPITE YOUR POLITE SILENCE THAT THAT ADVENTURE IS NOT VERY PRETTY. BUT JUST THINK OF YOUR LIFE MON CHER COMPATRIOTE! SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND SOME SIMILAR STORY THAT YOU’LL TELL ME LATER ON. IN MY CASE WHEN THAT BUSINESS CAME TO MIND I AGAIN BEGAN TO LAUGH. BUT IT WAS ANOTHER KIND OF LAUGH RATHER LIKE THE ONE I HAD HEARD ON THE PONT DES ARTS. I WAS LAUGHING AT MY SPEECHES AND MY PLEADINGS IN COURT. EVEN MORE AT MY COURT PLEADING THAN AT MY SPEECHES TO WOMEN. TO THEM AT LEAST I DID NOT LIE MUCH. INSTINCT SPOKE CLEARLY WITHOUT SUBTERFUGES IN MY ATTITUDE. THE ACT OF LOVE FOR INSTANCE IS A CONFESSION. SELFISHNESS SCREAMS ALOUD VANITY SHOWS OFF OR ELSE TRUE GENEROSITY REVEALS ITSELF. ULTIMATELY IN THAT REGRETTABLE STORY EVEN MORE THAN IN MY OTHER AFFAIRS I HAD BEEN MORE OUTSPOKEN THAN I THOUGHT; I HAD DECLARED WHO I WAS AND HOW I COULD LIVE. DESPITE APPEARANCES I WAS THEREFORE MORE WORTHY IN MY PRIVATE LIFE—EVEN WHEN (ONE MIGHT SAY: ESPECIALLY WHEN) I BEHAVED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU —THAN IN MY GREAT PROFESSIONAL FLIGHTS ABOUT INNOCENCE AND JUSTICE. AT LEAST SEEING MYSELF ACT WITH OTHERS I COULDN’T DECEIVE MYSELF AS TO THE TRUTH OF MY NATURE. NO MAN IS A HYPOCRITE IN HIS PLEASURES—HAVE I READ THAT OR DID I THINK IT MYSELF MON CHER COMPATRIOTE?

WHEN I EXAMINED THUS THE TROUBLE I HAD IN SEPARATING DEFINITIVELY FROM A WOMAN—A TROUBLE WHICH USED TO INVOLVE ME IN SO MANY SIMULTANEOUS LIAISONS—I DIDN’T BLAME MY SOFTHEARTEDNESS. THAT WAS NOT WHAT IMPELLED ME WHEN ONE OF MY MISTRESSES TIRED OF WAITING FOR THE AUSTERLITZ OF OUR PASSION AND SPOKE OF LEAVING ME. AT ONCE I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE A STEP FORWARD WHO YIELDED WHO BECAME ELOQUENT. AS FOR AFFECTION AND SOFTHEARTEDNESS I AROUSED THEM IN WOMEN EXPERIENCING MERELY THE APPEARANCE OF THEM MYSELF—SIMPLY A LITTLE EXCITED BY THIS REFUSAL ALARMED ALSO BY THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF SOMEONE’S AFFECTION. AT TIMES I TRULY THOUGHT I WAS SUFFERING TO BE SURE. BUT THE REBELLIOUS FEMALE HAD MERELY TO LEAVE IN FACT FOR ME TO FORGET HER WITHOUT EFFORT AS I FORGOT HER PRESENCE WHEN ON THE CONTRARY SHE HAD DECIDED TO RETURN. NO IT WAS NOT LOVE OR GENEROSITY THAT AWAKENED ME WHEN I WAS IN DANGER OF BEING FORSAKEN BUT MERELY THE DESIRE TO BE LOVED AND TO RECEIVE WHAT IN MY OPINION WAS DUE ME. THE MOMENT I WAS LOVED AND MY PARTNER AGAIN FORGOTTEN I SHONE I WAS AT THE TOP OF MY FORM I BECAME LIKABLE.

BE IT SAID MOREOVER THAT AS SOON AS I HAD RE-WON THAT AFFECTION I BECAME AWARE OF ITS WEIGHT. IN MY MOMENTS OF IRRITATION I TOLD MYSELF THAT THE IDEAL SOLUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF THE PERSON I WAS INTERESTED IN. HER DEATH WOULD ON THE ONE HAND HAVE DEFINITIVELY FIXED OUR RELATIONSHIP AND ON THE OTHER REMOVED ITS COMPULSION. BUT ONE CANNOT LONG FOR THE DEATH OF EVERYONE OR IN THE EXTREME DEPOPULATE THE PLANET IN ORDER TO ENJOY A FREEDOM THAT CANNOT BE IMAGINED OTHERWISE. MY SENSIBILITY WAS OPPOSED TO THIS AND MY LOVE OF MANKIND.

THE ONLY DEEP EMOTION I OCCASIONALLY FELT IN THESE AFFAIRS WAS GRATITUDE WHEN ALL WAS GOING WELL AND I WAS LEFT NOT ONLY PEACE BUT FREEDOM TO COME AND GO—NEVER KINDER AND GAYER WITH ONE WOMAN THAN WHEN I HAD JUST LEFT ANOTHER’S BED AS IF I EXTENDED TO ALL OTHERS THE DEBT I HAD JUST CONTRACTED TOWARD ONE OF THEM. IN ANY CASE HOWEVER APPARENTLY CONFUSED MY FEELINGS WERE THE RESULT I ACHIEVED WAS CLEAR: I KEPT ALL MY AFFECTIONS WITHIN REACH TO MAKE USE OF THEM WHEN I WANTED. ON MY OWN ADMISSION I COULD LIVE HAPPILY ONLY ON CONDITION THAT ALL THE INDIVIDUALS ON EARTH OR THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER WERE TURNED TOWARD ME ETERNALLY IN SUSPENSE DEVOID OF INDEPENDENT LIFE AND READY TO ANSWER MY CALL AT ANY MOMENT DOOMED IN SHORT TO STERILITY UNTIL THE DAY I SHOULD DEIGN TO FAVOR THEM. IN SHORT FOR ME TO LIVE HAPPILY IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CREATURES I CHOSE NOT TO LIVE AT ALL. THEY MUST RECEIVE THEIR LIFE SPORADICALLY ONLY AT MY BIDDING.

OH I DON’T FEEL ANY SELF-SATISFACTION BELIEVE ME IN TELLING YOU THIS. UPON THINKING OF THAT TIME WHEN I USED TO ASK FOR EVERYTHING WITHOUT PAYING ANYTHING MYSELF WHEN I USED TO MOBILIZE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY SERVICE WHEN I USED TO PUT THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR SO TO SPEAK IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM AT HAND SOME DAY WHEN IT WOULD SUIT ME I DON’T KNOW HOW TO NAME THE ODD FEELING THAT COMES OVER ME. ISN’T IT SHAME PERHAPS? TELL ME MON CHER COMPATRIOTE DOESN’T SHAME STING A LITTLE? IT DOES? WELL IT’S PROBABLY SHAME THEN OR ONE OF THOSE SILLY EMOTIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HONOR. IT SEEMS TO ME IN ANY CASE THAT THAT FEELING HAS NEVER LEFT ME SINCE THE ADVENTURE I FOUND AT THE HEART OF MY MEMORY WHICH I CANNOT ANY LONGER PUT OFF RELATING DESPITE MY DIGRESSIONS AND THE INVENTIVE EFFORTS FOR WHICH I HOPE YOU GIVE ME CREDIT.

LOOK THE RAIN HAS STOPPED! BE KIND ENOUGH TO WALK HOME WITH ME. I AM STRANGELY TIRED NOT FROM HAVING TALKED SO MUCH BUT AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF WHAT I STILL HAVE TO SAY. OH WELL A FEW WORDS WILL SUFFICE TO RELATE MY ESSENTIAL DISCOVERY. WHAT’S THE USE OF SAYING MORE ANYWAY? FOR THE STATUE TO STAND BARE THE FINE SPEECHES MUST TAKE FLIGHT LIKE PIGEONS. SO HERE GOES. THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT IN NOVEMBER TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE THE EVENING WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD LAUGHTER BEHIND ME I WAS RETURNING TO THE LEFT BANK AND MY HOME BY WAY OF THE PONT ROYAL. IT WAS AN HOUR PAST MIDNIGHT A FINE RAIN WAS FALLING A DRIZZLE RATHER THAT SCATTERED THE FEW PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. I HAD JUST LEFT A MISTRESS WHO WAS SURELY ALREADY ASLEEP. I WAS ENJOYING THAT WALK A LITTLE NUMBED MY BODY CALMED AND IRRIGATED BY A FLOW OF BLOOD GENTLE AS THE FALLING RAIN. ON THE BRIDGE I PASSED BEHIND A FIGURE LEANING OVER THE RAILING AND SEEMING TO STARE AT THE RIVER. ON CLOSER VIEW I MADE OUT A SLIM YOUNG WOMAN DRESSED IN BLACK. THE BACK OF HER NECK COOL AND DAMP BETWEEN HER DARK HAIR AND COAT COLLAR STIRRED ME. BUT I WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT’S HESITATION. AT THE END OF THE BRIDGE I FOLLOWED THE QUAYS TOWARD SAINT-MICHEL WHERE I LIVED. I HAD ALREADY GONE SOME FIFTY YARDS WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND—WHICH DESPITE THE DISTANCE SEEMED DREADFULLY LOUD IN THE MIDNIGHT SILENCE—OF A BODY STRIKING THE WATER. I STOPPED SHORT BUT WITHOUT TURNING AROUND. ALMOST AT ONCE I HEARD A CRY REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WHICH WAS GOING DOWNSTREAM; THEN IT SUDDENLY CEASED. THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED AS THE NIGHT SUDDENLY STOOD STILL SEEMED INTERMINABLE. I WANTED TO RUN AND YET DIDN’T STIR. I WAS TREMBLING I BELIEVE FROM COLD AND SHOCK. I TOLD MYSELF THAT I HAD TO BE QUICK AND I FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE WEAKNESS STEAL OVER ME. I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT I THOUGHT THEN. “TOO LATE TOO FAR …” OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT. I WAS STILL LISTENING AS I STOOD MOTIONLESS. THEN SLOWLY UNDER THE RAIN I WENT AWAY. I INFORMED NO ONE.

BUT HERE WE ARE; HERE’S MY HOUSE MY SHELTER! TOMORROW? YES IF YOU WISH. I’D LIKE TO TAKE YOU TO THE ISLAND OF MARKEN SO YOU CAN SEE THE ZUIDER ZEE. LET’S MEET AT ELEVEN AT MEXICO CITY. WHAT? THAT WOMAN? OH I DON’T KNOW. REALLY I DON’T KNOW. THE NEXT DAY AND THE DAYS FOLLOWING I DIDN’T READ THE PAPERS.

A DOLL’S VILLAGE ISN’T IT? NO SHORTAGE OF QUAINTNESS HERE! BUT I DIDN’T BRING YOU TO THIS ISLAND FOR QUAINTNESS CHER AMI. ANYONE CAN SHOW YOU PEASANT HEADDRESSES WOODEN SHOES AND ORNAMENTED HOUSES WITH FISHERMEN SMOKING CHOICE TOBACCO SURROUNDED BY THE SMELL OF FURNITURE WAX. I AM ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND WHO CAN SHOW YOU WHAT REALLY MATTERS HERE.

WE ARE REACHING THE DIKE. WE’LL HAVE TO FOLLOW IT TO GET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THESE TOO CHARMING HOUSES. PLEASE LET’S SIT DOWN. WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT? ISN’T IT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NEGATIVE LANDSCAPE? JUST SEE ON THE LEFT THAT PILE OF ASHES THEY CALL A DUNE HERE THE GRAY DIKE ON THE RIGHT THE LIVID BEACH AT OUR FEET AND IN FRONT OF US THE SEA THE COLOR OF A WEAK LYE-SOLUTION WITH THE VAST SKY REFLECTING THE COLORLESS WATERS. A SOGGY HELL INDEED! EVERYTHING HORIZONTAL NO RELIEF; SPACE IS COLORLESS AND LIFE DEAD. IS IT NOT UNIVERSAL OBLITERATION EVERLASTING NOTHINGNESS MADE VISIBLE? NO HUMAN BEINGS ABOVE ALL NO HUMAN BEINGS! YOU AND I ALONE FACING THE PLANET AT LAST DESERTED! THE SKY IS ALIVE? YOU ARE RIGHT CHER AMI. IT THICKENS BECOMES CONCAVE OPENS UP AIR SHAFTS AND CLOSES CLOUDY DOORS. THOSE ARE THE DOVES. HAVEN’T YOU NOTICED THAT THE SKY OF HOLLAND IS FILLED WITH MILLIONS OF DOVES INVISIBLE BECAUSE OF THEIR ALTITUDE WHICH FLAP THEIR WINGS RISE OR FALL IN UNISON FILLING THE HEAVENLY SPACE WITH DENSE MULTITUDES OF GRAYISH FEATHERS CARRIED HITHER AND THITHER BY THE WIND? THE DOVES WAIT UP THERE ALL YEAR ROUND. THEY WHEEL ABOVE THE EARTH LOOK DOWN AND WOULD LIKE TO COME DOWN. BUT THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE SEA AND THE CANALS ROOFS COVERED WITH SHOP SIGNS AND NEVER A HEAD ON WHICH TO LIGHT.

YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? I’LL ADMIT MY FATIGUE. I LOSE THE THREAD OF WHAT I AM SAYING; I’VE LOST THAT LUCIDITY TO WHICH MY FRIENDS USED TO ENJOY PAYING RESPECTS. I SAY “MY FRIENDS” MOREOVER AS A CONVENTION. I HAVE NO MORE FRIENDS; I HAVE NOTHING BUT ACCOMPLICES. TO MAKE UP FOR THIS THEIR NUMBER HAS INCREASED; THEY ARE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE. AND WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE YOU FIRST OF ALL. WHOEVER IS AT HAND IS ALWAYS THE FIRST. HOW DO I KNOW I HAVE NO FRIENDS? IT’S VERY EASY: I DISCOVERED IT THE DAY I THOUGHT OF KILLING MYSELF TO PLAY A TRICK ON THEM TO PUNISH THEM IN A WAY. BUT PUNISH WHOM? SOME WOULD BE SURPRISED AND NO ONE WOULD FEEL PUNISHED. I REALIZED I HAD NO FRIENDS. BESIDES EVEN IF I HAD HAD I SHOULDN’T BE ANY BETTER OFF. IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO COMMIT SUICIDE AND THEN SEE THEIR REACTION WHY THEN THE GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH THE CANDLE. BUT THE EARTH IS DARK CHER AMI THE COFFIN THICK AND THE SHROUD OPAQUE. THE EYES OF THE SOUL—TO BE SURE—IF THERE IS A SOUL AND IT HAS EYES! BUT YOU SEE WE’RE NOT SURE WE CAN’T BE SURE. OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE A SOLUTION; AT LEAST ONE COULD GET ONESELF TAKEN SERIOUSLY. MEN ARE NEVER CONVINCED OF YOUR REASONS OF YOUR SINCERITY OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR SUFFERINGS EXCEPT BY YOUR DEATH. SO LONG AS YOU ARE ALIVE YOUR CASE IS DOUBTFUL; YOU HAVE A RIGHT ONLY TO THEIR SKEPTICISM. SO IF THERE WERE THE LEAST CERTAINTY THAT ONE COULD ENJOY THE SHOW IT WOULD BE WORTH PROVING TO THEM WHAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BELIEVE AND THUS AMAZING THEM. BUT YOU KILL YOURSELF AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELIEVE YOU? YOU ARE NOT THERE TO SEE THEIR AMAZEMENT AND THEIR CONTRITION (FLEETING AT BEST) TO WITNESS ACCORDING TO EVERY MAN’S DREAM YOUR OWN FUNERAL. IN ORDER TO CEASE BEING A DOUBTFUL CASE ONE HAS TO CEASE BEING THAT’S ALL.

BESIDES ISN’T IT BETTER THUS? WE’D SUFFER TOO MUCH FROM THEIR INDIFFERENCE. “YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS!” A DAUGHTER SAID TO HER FATHER WHO HAD PREVENTED HER FROM MARRYING A TOO WELL GROOMED SUITOR. AND SHE KILLED HERSELF. BUT THE FATHER PAID FOR NOTHING. HE LOVED FLY-CASTING. THREE SUNDAYS LATER HE WENT BACK TO THE RIVER—TO FORGET AS HE SAID. HE WAS RIGHT; HE FORGOT. TO TELL THE TRUTH THE CONTRARY WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISING. YOU THINK YOU ARE DYING TO PUNISH YOUR WIFE AND ACTUALLY YOU ARE FREEING HER. IT’S BETTER NOT TO SEE THAT. BESIDES THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR THE REASONS THEY GIVE FOR YOUR ACTION. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I CAN HEAR THEM NOW: “HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULDN’T BEAR …” AH CHER AMI HOW POOR IN INVENTION MEN ARE! THEY ALWAYS THINK ONE COMMITS SUICIDE FOR A REASON. BUT IT’S QUITE POSSIBLE TO COMMIT SUICIDE FOR TWO REASONS. NO THAT NEVER OCCURS TO THEM. SO WHAT’S THE GOOD OF DYING INTENTIONALLY OF SACRIFICING YOURSELF TO THE IDEA YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE OF YOU? ONCE YOU ARE DEAD THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT TO ATTRIBUTE IDIOTIC OR VULGAR MOTIVES TO YOUR ACTION. MARTYRS CHER AMI MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING FORGOTTEN MOCKED OR MADE USE OF. AS FOR BEING UNDERSTOOD—NEVER!

BESIDES LET’S NOT BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH; I LOVE LIFE—THAT’S MY REAL WEAKNESS. I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I AM INCAPABLE OF IMAGINING WHAT IS NOT LIFE. SUCH AVIDITY HAS SOMETHING PLEBEIAN ABOUT IT DON’T YOU THINK? ARISTOCRACY CANNOT IMAGINE ITSELF WITHOUT A LITTLE DISTANCE SURROUNDING ITSELF AND ITS LIFE. ONE DIES IF NECESSARY ONE BREAKS RATHER THAN BENDING. BUT I BEND BECAUSE I CONTINUE TO LOVE MYSELF. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER ALL I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK I DEVELOPED? AN AVERSION FOR MYSELF? COME COME IT WAS ESPECIALLY WITH OTHERS THAT I WAS FED UP. TO BE SURE I KNEW MY FAILINGS AND REGRETTED THEM. YET I CONTINUED TO FORGET THEM WITH A RATHER MERITORIOUS OBSTINACY. THE PROSECUTION OF OTHERS ON THE CONTRARY WENT ON CONSTANTLY IN MY HEART. OF COURSE—DOES THAT SHOCK YOU? MAYBE YOU THINK IT’S NOT LOGICAL? BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT TO REMAIN LOGICAL. THE QUESTION IS TO SLIP THROUGH AND ABOVE ALL—YES ABOVE ALL THE QUESTION IS TO ELUDE JUDGMENT. I’M NOT SAYING TO AVOID PUNISHMENT FOR PUNISHMENT WITHOUT JUDGMENT IS BEARABLE. IT HAS A NAME BESIDES THAT GUARANTEES OUR INNOCENCE: IT IS CALLED MISFORTUNE. NO ON THE CONTRARY IT’S A MATTER OF DODGING JUDGMENT OF AVOIDING BEING FOREVER JUDGED WITHOUT EVER HAVING A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED.

BUT ONE CAN’T DODGE IT SO EASILY. TODAY WE ARE ALWAYS READY TO JUDGE AS WE ARE TO FORNICATE. WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THERE ARE NO INADEQUACIES TO FEAR. IF YOU DOUBT THIS JUST LISTEN TO THE TABLE CONVERSATION DURING AUGUST IN THOSE SUMMER HOTELS WHERE OUR CHARITABLE FELLOW CITIZENS TAKE THE BOREDOM CURE. IF YOU STILL HESITATE TO CONCLUDE READ THE WRITINGS OF OUR GREAT MEN OF THE MOMENT. OR ELSE OBSERVE YOUR OWN FAMILY AND YOU WILL BE EDIFIED. MON CHER AMI LET’S NOT GIVE THEM ANY PRETEXT NO MATTER HOW SMALL FOR JUDGING US! OTHERWISE WE’LL BE LEFT IN SHREDS. WE ARE FORCED TO TAKE THE SAME PRECAUTIONS AS THE ANIMAL TAMER. IF BEFORE GOING INTO THE CAGE HE HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO CUT HIMSELF WHILE SHAVING WHAT A FEAST FOR THE WILD ANIMALS! I REALIZED THIS ALL AT ONCE THE MOMENT I HAD THE SUSPICION THAT MAYBE I WASN’T SO ADMIRABLE. FROM THEN ON I BECAME DISTRUSTFUL. SINCE I WAS BLEEDING SLIGHTLY THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FOR ME; THEY WOULD DEVOUR ME.

MY RELATIONS WITH MY CONTEMPORARIES WERE APPARENTLY THE SAME AND YET SUBTLY OUT OF TUNE. MY FRIENDS HADN’T CHANGED. ON OCCASION THEY STILL EXTOLLED THE HARMONY AND SECURITY THEY FOUND IN MY COMPANY. BUT I WAS AWARE ONLY OF THE DISSONANCES AND DISORDER THAT FILLED ME; I FELT VULNERABLE AND OPEN TO PUBLIC ACCUSATION. IN MY EYES MY FELLOWS CEASED TO BE THE RESPECTFUL PUBLIC TO WHICH I WAS ACCUSTOMED. THE CIRCLE OF WHICH I WAS THE CENTER BROKE AND THEY LINED UP IN A ROW AS ON THE JUDGES’ BENCH. IN SHORT THE MOMENT I GRASPED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO JUDGE IN ME I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS IN THEM AN IRRESISTIBLE VOCATION FOR JUDGMENT. YES THEY WERE THERE AS BEFORE BUT THEY WERE LAUGHING. OR RATHER IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERY ONE I ENCOUNTERED WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A HIDDEN SMILE. I EVEN HAD THE IMPRESSION AT THAT TIME THAT PEOPLE WERE TRIPPING ME UP. TWO OR THREE TIMES IN FACT I STUMBLED AS I ENTERED PUBLIC PLACES. ONCE EVEN I WENT SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR. THE CARTESIAN FRENCHMAN IN ME DIDN’T TAKE LONG TO CATCH HOLD OF HIMSELF AND ATTRIBUTE THOSE ACCIDENTS TO THE ONLY REASONABLE DIVINITY—THAT IS CHANCE. NONETHELESS MY DISTRUST REMAINED.

ONCE MY ATTENTION WAS AROUSED IT WAS NOT HARD FOR ME TO DISCOVER THAT I HAD ENEMIES. IN MY PROFESSION TO BEGIN WITH AND ALSO IN MY SOCIAL LIFE. SOME AMONG THEM I HAD OBLIGED. OTHERS I SHOULD HAVE OBLIGED. ALL THAT AFTER ALL WAS NATURAL AND I DISCOVERED IT WITHOUT TOO MUCH GRIEF. IT WAS HARDER AND MORE PAINFUL ON THE OTHER HAND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD ENEMIES AMONG PEOPLE I HARDLY KNEW OR DIDN’T KNOW AT ALL. I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT WITH THE INGENUOUSNESS I HAVE ALREADY ILLUSTRATED TO YOU THAT THOSE WHO DIDN’T KNOW ME COULDN’T RESIST LIKING ME IF THEY CAME TO KNOW ME. NOT AT ALL! I ENCOUNTERED HOSTILITY ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WHO KNEW ME ONLY AT A DISTANCE WITHOUT MY KNOWING THEM MYSELF. DOUBTLESS THEY SUSPECTED ME OF LIVING FULLY GIVEN UP COMPLETELY TO HAPPINESS; AND THAT CANNOT BE FORGIVEN. THE LOOK OF SUCCESS WHEN IT IS WORN IN A CERTAIN WAY WOULD INFURIATE A JACKASS. THEN AGAIN MY LIFE WAS FULL TO BURSTING AND FOR LACK OF TIME I USED TO REFUSE MANY ADVANCES. THEN I WOULD FORGET MY REFUSALS FOR THE SAME REASON. BUT THOSE ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE ME BY PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE NOT FULL AND WHO FOR THAT VERY REASON WOULD REMEMBER MY REFUSALS.

THUS IT IS THAT IN THE END TO TAKE BUT ONE EXAMPLE WOMEN COST ME DEAR. THE TIME I USED TO DEVOTE TO THEM I COULDN’T GIVE TO MEN WHO DIDN’T ALWAYS FORGIVE ME THIS. IS THERE ANY WAY OUT? YOUR SUCCESSES AND HAPPINESS ARE FORGIVEN YOU ONLY IF YOU GENEROUSLY CONSENT TO SHARE THEM. BUT TO BE HAPPY IT IS ESSENTIAL NOT TO BE TOO CONCERNED WITH OTHERS. CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO ESCAPE. HAPPY AND JUDGED OR ABSOLVED AND WRETCHED. AS FOR ME THE INJUSTICE WAS EVEN GREATER: I WAS CONDEMNED FOR PAST SUCCESSES. FOR A LONG TIME I HAD LIVED IN THE ILLUSION OF A GENERAL AGREEMENT WHEREAS FROM ALL SIDES JUDGMENTS ARROWS MOCKERIES RAINED UPON ME INATTENTIVE AND SMILING. THE DAY I WAS ALERTED I BECAME LUCID; I RECEIVED ALL THE WOUNDS AT THE SAME TIME AND LOST MY STRENGTH ALL AT ONCE. THE WHOLE UNIVERSE THEN BEGAN TO LAUGH AT ME.

THAT IS WHAT NO MAN (EXCEPT THOSE WHO ARE NOT REALLY ALIVE—IN OTHER WORDS WISE MEN) CAN ENDURE. SPITEFULNESS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OSTENTATION. PEOPLE HASTEN TO JUDGE IN ORDER NOT TO BE JUDGED THEMSELVES. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? THE IDEA THAT COMES MOST NATURALLY TO MAN AS IF FROM HIS VERY NATURE IS THE IDEA OF HIS INNOCENCE. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW WE ARE ALL LIKE THAT LITTLE FRENCHMAN AT BUCHENWALD WHO INSISTED ON REGISTERING A COMPLAINT WITH THE CLERK HIMSELF A PRISONER WHO WAS RECORDING HIS ARRIVAL. A COMPLAINT? THE CLERK AND HIS COMRADES LAUGHED: “USELESS OLD MAN. YOU DON’T LODGE A COMPLAINT HERE.” “BUT YOU SEE SIR” SAID THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN “MY CASE IS EXCEPTIONAL. I AM INNOCENT!”

WE ARE ALL EXCEPTIONAL CASES. WE ALL WANT TO APPEAL AGAINST SOMETHING! EACH OF US INSISTS ON BEING INNOCENT AT ALL COST EVEN IF HE HAS TO ACCUSE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE AND HEAVEN ITSELF. YOU WON’T DELIGHT A MAN BY COMPLIMENTING HIM ON THE EFFORTS BY WHICH HE HAS BECOME INTELLIGENT OR GENEROUS. ON THE OTHER HAND HE WILL BEAM IF YOU ADMIRE HIS NATURAL GENEROSITY. INVERSELY IF YOU TELL A CRIMINAL THAT HIS CRIME IS NOT DUE TO HIS NATURE OR HIS CHARACTER BUT TO UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WILL BE EXTRAVAGANTLY GRATEFUL TO YOU. DURING THE COUNSEL’S SPEECH THIS IS THE MOMENT HE WILL CHOOSE TO WEEP. YET THERE IS NO CREDIT IN BEING HONEST OR INTELLIGENT BY BIRTH. JUST AS ONE IS SURELY NO MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING A CRIMINAL BY NATURE THAN FOR BEING A CRIMINAL BY CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT THOSE RASCALS WANT GRACE THAT IS IRRESPONSIBILITY AND THEY SHAMELESSLY ALLEGE THE JUSTIFICATIONS OF NATURE OR THE EXCUSES OF CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN IF THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY. THE ESSENTIAL THING IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE INNOCENT THAT THEIR VIRTUES BY GRACE OF BIRTH SHOULD NOT BE QUESTIONED AND THAT THEIR MISDEEDS BORN OF A MOMENTARY MISFORTUNE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE THAN PROVISIONAL. AS I TOLD YOU IT’S A MATTER OF DODGING JUDGMENT. SINCE IT IS HARD TO DODGE IT TRICKY TO GET ONE’S NATURE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADMIRED AND EXCUSED THEY ALL STRIVE TO BE RICH. WHY? DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF? FOR POWER OF COURSE. BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WEALTH SHIELDS FROM IMMEDIATE JUDGMENT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE SUBWAY CROWD TO ENCLOSE YOU IN A CHROMIUM-PLATED AUTOMOBILE ISOLATES YOU IN HUGE PROTECTED LAWNS PULLMANS FIRST-CLASS CABINS. WEALTH CHER AMI IS NOT QUITE ACQUITTAL BUT REPRIEVE AND THAT’S ALWAYS WORTH TAKING.

ABOVE ALL DON’T BELIEVE YOUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO BE SINCERE WITH THEM. THEY MERELY HOPE YOU WILL ENCOURAGE THEM IN THE GOOD OPINION THEY HAVE OF THEMSELVES BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE THEY WILL FIND IN YOUR PROMISE OF SINCERITY. HOW COULD SINCERITY BE A CONDITION OF FRIENDSHIP? A LIKING FOR TRUTH AT ANY COST IS A PASSION THAT SPARES NOTHING AND THAT NOTHING RESISTS. IT’S A VICE AT TIMES A COMFORT OR A SELFISHNESS. THEREFORE IF YOU ARE IN THAT SITUATION DON’T HESITATE: PROMISE TO TELL THE TRUTH AND THEN LIE AS BEST YOU CAN. YOU WILL SATISFY THEIR HIDDEN DESIRE AND DOUBLY PROVE YOUR AFFECTION.

THIS IS SO TRUE THAT WE RARELY CONFIDE IN THOSE WHO ARE BETTER THAN WE. RATHER WE ARE MORE INCLINED TO FLEE THEIR SOCIETY. MOST OFTEN ON THE OTHER HAND WE CONFESS TO THOSE WHO ARE LIKE US AND WHO SHARE OUR WEAKNESSES. HENCE WE DON’T WANT TO IMPROVE OURSELVES OR BE BETTERED FOR WE SHOULD FIRST HAVE TO BE JUDGED IN DEFAULT. WE MERELY WISH TO BE PITIED AND ENCOURAGED IN THE COURSE WE HAVE CHOSEN. IN SHORT WE SHOULD LIKE AT THE SAME TIME TO CEASE BEING GUILTY AND YET NOT TO MAKE THE EFFORT OF CLEANSING OURSELVES. NOT ENOUGH CYNICISM AND NOT ENOUGH VIRTUE. WE LACK THE ENERGY OF EVIL AS WELL AS THE ENERGY OF GOOD. DO YOU KNOW DANTE? REALLY? THE DEVIL YOU SAY! THEN YOU KNOW THAT DANTE ACCEPTS THE IDEA OF NEUTRAL ANGELS IN THE QUARREL BETWEEN GOD AND SATAN. AND HE PUTS THEM IN LIMBO A SORT OF VESTIBULE OF HIS HELL. WE ARE IN THE VESTIBULE CHER AMI.

PATIENCE? YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT. IT WOULD TAKE PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR THE LAST JUDGMENT. BUT THAT’S IT WE’RE IN A HURRY. SO MUCH IN A HURRY INDEED THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE MYSELF A JUDGE-PENITENT. HOWEVER I FIRST HAD TO MAKE SHIFT WITH MY DISCOVERIES AND PUT MYSELF RIGHT WITH MY CONTEMPORARIES’ LAUGHTER. FROM THE EVENING WHEN I WAS CALLED—FOR I WAS REALLY CALLED—I HAD TO ANSWER OR AT LEAST SEEK AN ANSWER. IT WASN’T EASY; FOR SOME TIME I FLOUNDERED. TO BEGIN WITH THAT PERPETUAL LAUGH AND THE LAUGHERS HAD TO TEACH ME TO SEE CLEARLY WITHIN ME AND TO DISCOVER AT LAST THAT I WAS NOT SIMPLE. DON’T SMILE; THAT TRUTH IS NOT SO BASIC AS IT SEEMS. WHAT WE CALL BASIC TRUTHS ARE SIMPLY THE ONES WE DISCOVER AFTER ALL THE OTHERS.

HOWEVER THAT MAY BE AFTER PROLONGED RESEARCH ON MYSELF I BROUGHT OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL DUPLICITY OF THE HUMAN BEING. THEN I REALIZED AS A RESULT OF DELVING IN MY MEMORY THAT MODESTY HELPED ME TO SHINE HUMILITY TO CONQUER AND VIRTUE TO OPPRESS. I USED TO WAGE WAR BY PEACEFUL MEANS AND EVENTUALLY USED TO ACHIEVE THROUGH DISINTERESTED MEANS EVERYTHING I DESIRED. FOR INSTANCE I NEVER COMPLAINED THAT MY BIRTHDAY WAS OVERLOOKED; PEOPLE WERE EVEN SURPRISED WITH A TOUCH OF ADMIRATION BY MY DISCRETION ON THIS SUBJECT. BUT THE REASON FOR MY DISINTERESTEDNESS WAS EVEN MORE DISCREET: I LONGED TO BE FORGOTTEN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPLAIN TO MYSELF. SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE FAMOUS DATE (WHICH I KNEW VERY WELL) I WAS ON THE ALERT EAGER TO LET NOTHING SLIP THAT MIGHT AROUSE THE ATTENTION AND MEMORY OF THOSE ON WHOSE LAPSE I WAS COUNTING (DIDN’T I ONCE GO SO FAR AS TO CONTEMPLATE FALSIFYING A FRIEND’S CALENDAR?). ONCE MY SOLITUDE WAS THOROUGHLY PROVED I COULD SURRENDER TO THE CHARMS OF A VIRILE SELF-PITY.

THUS THE SURFACE OF ALL MY VIRTUES HAD A LESS IMPOSING REVERSE SIDE. IT IS TRUE THAT IN ANOTHER SENSE MY SHORTCOMINGS TURNED TO MY ADVANTAGE. FOR EXAMPLE THE OBLIGATION I FELT TO CONCEAL THE VICIOUS PART OF MY LIFE GAVE ME A COLD LOOK THAT WAS CONFUSED WITH THE LOOK OF VIRTUE; MY INDIFFERENCE MADE ME LOVED; MY SELFISHNESS WOUND UP IN MY GENEROSITIES. I STOP THERE FOR TOO GREAT A SYMMETRY WOULD UPSET MY ARGUMENT. BUT AFTER ALL I PRESENTED A HARSH EXTERIOR AND YET COULD NEVER RESIST THE OFFER OF A GLASS OR OF A WOMAN! I WAS CONSIDERED ACTIVE ENERGETIC AND MY KINGDOM WAS THE BED. I USED TO ADVERTISE MY LOYALTY AND I DON’T BELIEVE THERE IS A SINGLE PERSON I LOVED THAT I DIDN’T EVENTUALLY BETRAY. OF COURSE MY BETRAYALS DIDN’T STAND IN THE WAY OF MY FIDELITY; I USED TO KNOCK OFF A CONSIDERABLE PILE OF WORK THROUGH SUCCESSIVE PERIODS OF IDLENESS; AND I HAD NEVER CEASED AIDING MY NEIGHBOR THANKS TO MY ENJOYMENT IN DOING SO. BUT HOWEVER MUCH I REPEATED SUCH FACTS TO MYSELF THEY GAVE ME BUT SUPERFICIAL CONSOLATIONS. CERTAIN MORNINGS I WOULD GET UP THE CASE AGAINST MYSELF MOST THOROUGHLY COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I EXCELLED ABOVE ALL IN SCORN. THE VERY PEOPLE I HELPED MOST OFTEN WERE THE MOST SCORNED. COURTEOUSLY WITH A SOLIDARITY CHARGED WITH EMOTION I USED TO SPIT DAILY IN THE FACE OF ALL THE BLIND.

TELL ME FRANKLY IS THERE ANY EXCUSE FOR THAT? THERE IS ONE BUT SO WRETCHED THAT I CANNOT DREAM OF ADVANCING IT. IN ANY CASE HERE IT IS: I HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS WERE SERIOUS MATTERS. I HAD NO IDEA WHERE THE SERIOUS MIGHT LIE EXCEPT THAT IT WAS NOT IN ALL THIS I SAW AROUND ME—WHICH SEEMED TO ME MERELY AN AMUSING GAME OR TIRESOME. THERE ARE REALLY EFFORTS AND CONVICTIONS I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. I ALWAYS LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AND A CERTAIN SUSPICION ON THOSE STRANGE CREATURES WHO DIED FOR MONEY FELL INTO DESPAIR OVER THE LOSS OF A “POSITION” OR SACRIFICED THEMSELVES WITH A HIGH AND MIGHTY MANNER FOR THE PROSPERITY OF THEIR FAMILY. I COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT FRIEND WHO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO STOP SMOKING AND THROUGH SHEER WILL POWER HAD SUCCEEDED. ONE MORNING HE OPENED THE PAPER READ THAT THE FIRST H-BOMB HAD BEEN EXPLODED LEARNED ABOUT ITS WONDERFUL EFFECTS AND HASTENED TO A TOBACCO SHOP.

TO BE SURE I OCCASIONALLY PRETENDED TO TAKE LIFE SERIOUSLY. BUT VERY SOON THE FRIVOLITY OF SERIOUSNESS STRUCK ME AND I MERELY WENT ON PLAYING MY ROLE AS WELL AS I COULD. I PLAYED AT BEING EFFICIENT INTELLIGENT VIRTUOUS CIVIC-MINDED SHOCKED INDULGENT FELLOW-SPIRITED EDIFYING … IN SHORT THERE’S NO NEED OF GOING ON YOU HAVE ALREADY GRASPED THAT I WAS LIKE MY DUTCHMEN WHO ARE HERE WITHOUT BEING HERE: I WAS ABSENT AT THE MOMENT WHEN I TOOK UP THE MOST SPACE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY SINCERE AND ENTHUSIASTIC EXCEPT WHEN I USED TO INDULGE IN SPORTS AND IN THE ARMY WHEN I USED TO ACT IN PLAYS WE PUT ON FOR OUR OWN AMUSEMENT. IN BOTH CASES THERE WAS A RULE OF THE GAME WHICH WAS NOT SERIOUS BUT WHICH WE ENJOYED TAKING AS IF IT WERE. EVEN NOW THE SUNDAY MATCHES IN AN OVERFLOWING STADIUM AND THE THEATER WHICH I LOVED WITH THE GREATEST PASSION ARE THE ONLY PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE I FEEL INNOCENT.

BUT WHO WOULD CONSIDER SUCH AN ATTITUDE LEGITIMATE IN THE FACE OF LOVE DEATH AND THE WAGES OF THE POOR? YET WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT? I COULD IMAGINE THE LOVE OF ISOLDE ONLY IN NOVELS OR ON THE STAGE. AT TIMES PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATHBED SEEMED TO ME CONVINCED OF THEIR ROLES. THE LINES SPOKEN BY MY POOR CLIENTS ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS FITTING THE SAME PATTERN. WHENCE LIVING AMONG MEN WITHOUT SHARING THEIR INTERESTS I COULD NOT MANAGE TO BELIEVE IN THE COMMITMENTS I MADE. I WAS COURTEOUS AND INDOLENT ENOUGH TO LIVE UP TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME IN MY PROFESSION MY FAMILY OR MY CIVIC LIFE BUT EACH TIME WITH A SORT OF INDIFFERENCE THAT SPOILED EVERYTHING. I LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE UNDER A DOUBLE CODE AND MY MOST SERIOUS ACTS WERE OFTEN THE ONES IN WHICH I WAS THE LEAST INVOLVED. WASN’T THAT AFTER ALL THE REASON THAT ADDED TO MY BLUNDERS I COULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF THAT MADE ME REVOLT MOST VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE JUDGMENT I FELT FORMING IN ME AND AROUND ME AND THAT FORCED ME TO SEEK AN ESCAPE?

FOR SOME TIME MY LIFE CONTINUED OUTWARDLY AS IF NOTHING HAD CHANGED. I WAS ON RAILS AND SPEEDING AHEAD. AS IF PURPOSELY PEOPLE’S PRAISES INCREASED. AND THAT’S JUST WHERE THE TROUBLE CAME FROM. YOU REMEMBER THE REMARK: “WOE TO YOU WHEN ALL MEN SPEAK WELL OF YOU!” AH THE ONE WHO SAID THAT SPOKE WORDS OF WISDOM! WOE TO ME! CONSEQUENTLY THE ENGINE BEGAN TO HAVE WHIMS INEXPLICABLE BREAKDOWNS.

THEN IT WAS THAT THE THOUGHT OF DEATH BURST INTO MY DAILY LIFE. I WOULD MEASURE THE YEARS SEPARATING ME FROM MY END. I WOULD LOOK FOR EXAMPLES OF MEN OF MY AGE WHO WERE ALREADY DEAD. AND I WAS TORMENTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO ACCOMPLISH MY TASK. WHAT TASK? I HAD NO IDEA. FRANKLY WAS WHAT I WAS DOING WORTH CONTINUING? BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE IT. A RIDICULOUS FEAR PURSUED ME IN FACT: ONE COULD NOT DIE WITHOUT HAVING CONFESSED ALL ONE’S LIES. NOT TO GOD OR TO ONE OF HIS REPRESENTATIVES; I WAS ABOVE THAT AS YOU WELL IMAGINE. NO IT WAS A MATTER OF CONFESSING TO MEN TO A FRIEND TO A BELOVED WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE. OTHERWISE WERE THERE BUT ONE LIE HIDDEN IN A LIFE DEATH MADE IT DEFINITIVE. NO ONE EVER AGAIN WOULD KNOW THE TRUTH ON THIS POINT SINCE THE ONLY ONE TO KNOW IT WAS PRECISELY THE DEAD MAN SLEEPING ON HIS SECRET. THAT ABSOLUTE MURDER OF A TRUTH USED TO MAKE ME DIZZY. TODAY LET ME INTERJECT IT WOULD CAUSE ME INSTEAD SUBTLE JOYS. THE IDEA FOR INSTANCE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE TO KNOW WHAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR AND THAT I HAVE AT HOME AN OBJECT WHICH KEPT THE POLICE OF THREE COUNTRIES ON THE RUN IS A SHEER DELIGHT. BUT LET’S NOT GO INTO THAT. AT THE TIME I HAD NOT YET FOUND THE RECIPE AND I WAS FRETTING.

I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER OF COURSE. WHAT DID ONE MAN’S LIE MATTER IN THE HISTORY OF GENERATIONS? AND WHAT PRETENSION TO WANT TO DRAG OUT INTO THE FULL LIGHT OF TRUTH A PALTRY FRAUD LOST IN THE SEA OF AGES LIKE A GRAIN OF SAND IN THE OCEAN! I ALSO TOLD MYSELF THAT THE BODY’S DEATH TO JUDGE FROM THOSE I HAD SEEN WAS IN ITSELF SUFFICIENT PUNISHMENT THAT ABSOLVED ALL. SALVATION WAS WON (THAT IS THE RIGHT TO DISAPPEAR DEFINITIVELY) IN THE SWEAT OF THE DEATH AGONY. NONETHELESS THE DISCOMFORT GREW; DEATH WAS FAITHFUL AT MY BEDSIDE; I USED TO GET UP WITH IT EVERY MORNING AND COMPLIMENTS BECAME MORE AND MORE UNBEARABLE TO ME. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALSEHOOD INCREASED WITH THEM SO INORDINATELY THAT NEVER AGAIN COULD I PUT MYSELF RIGHT.

A DAY CAME WHEN I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER. MY FIRST REACTION WAS EXCESSIVE. SINCE I WAS A LIAR I WOULD REVEAL THIS AND HURL MY DUPLICITY IN THE FACE OF ALL THOSE IMBECILES EVEN BEFORE THEY DISCOVERED IT. PROVOKED TO TRUTH I WOULD ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE. IN ORDER TO FORESTALL THE LAUGHTER I DREAMED OF HURLING MYSELF INTO THE GENERAL DERISION. IN SHORT IT WAS STILL A QUESTION OF DODGING JUDGMENT. I WANTED TO PUT THE LAUGHERS ON MY SIDE OR AT LEAST TO PUT MYSELF ON THEIR SIDE. I CONTEMPLATED FOR INSTANCE JOSTLING THE BLIND ON THE STREET; AND FROM THE SECRET UNEXPECTED JOY THIS GAVE ME I RECOGNIZED HOW MUCH A PART OF MY SOUL LOATHED THEM; I PLANNED TO PUNCTURE THE TIRES OF INVALIDS’ VEHICLES TO GO AND SHOUT “LOUSY PROLETARIAN” UNDER THE SCAFFOLDINGS ON WHICH LABORERS WERE WORKING TO SLAP INFANTS IN THE SUBWAY. I DREAMED OF ALL THAT AND DID NONE OF IT OR IF I DID SOMETHING OF THE SORT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT. IN ANY CASE THE VERY WORD “JUSTICE” GAVE ME STRANGE FITS OF RAGE. I CONTINUED OF NECESSITY TO USE IT IN MY SPEECHES TO THE COURT. BUT I TOOK MY REVENGE BY PUBLICLY INVEIGHING AGAINST THE HUMANITARIAN SPIRIT; I ANNOUNCED THE PUBLICATION OF A MANIFESTO EXPOSING THE OPPRESSION THAT THE OPPRESSED INFLICT ON DECENT PEOPLE. ONE DAY WHILE I WAS EATING LOBSTER AT A SIDEWALK RESTAURANT AND A BEGGAR BOTHERED ME I CALLED THE PROPRIETOR TO DRIVE HIM AWAY AND LOUDLY APPROVED THE WORDS OF THAT ADMINISTRATOR OF JUSTICE: “YOU ARE EMBARRASSING PEOPLE” HE SAID. “JUST PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE OF THESE LADIES AND GENTS AFTER ALL!” FINALLY I USED TO EXPRESS TO WHOEVER WOULD LISTEN MY REGRET THAT IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO ACT LIKE A CERTAIN RUSSIAN LANDOWNER WHOSE CHARACTER I ADMIRED. HE WOULD HAVE A BEATING ADMINISTERED BOTH TO HIS PEASANTS WHO BOWED TO HIM AND TO THOSE WHO DIDN’T BOW TO HIM IN ORDER TO PUNISH A BOLDNESS HE CONSIDERED EQUALLY IMPUDENT IN BOTH CASES.

HOWEVER I RECALL MORE SERIOUS EXCESSES. I BEGAN TO WRITE AN “ODE TO THE POLICE” AND AN “APOTHEOSIS OF THE GUILLOTINE.” ABOVE ALL I USED TO FORCE MYSELF TO VISIT REGULARLY THE SPECIAL CAFÉS WHERE OUR PROFESSIONAL HUMANITARIAN FREE THINKERS GATHERED. MY GOOD PAST RECORD ASSURED ME OF A WELCOME. THERE WITHOUT SEEMING TO I WOULD LET FLY A FORBIDDEN EXPRESSION: “THANK GOD …” I WOULD SAY OR MORE SIMPLY: “MY GOD …” YOU KNOW WHAT SHY LITTLE CHILDREN OUR CAFÉ ATHEISTS ARE. A MOMENT OF AMAZEMENT WOULD FOLLOW THAT OUTRAGEOUS EXPRESSION THEY WOULD LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER DUMBFOUNDED THEN THE TUMULT WOULD BURST FORTH. SOME WOULD FLEE THE CAFÉ OTHERS WOULD GABBLE INDIGNANTLY WITHOUT LISTENING TO ANYTHING AND ALL WOULD WRITHE IN CONVULSIONS LIKE THE DEVIL IN HOLY WATER.

YOU MUST LOOK ON THAT AS CHILDISH. YET MAYBE THERE WAS A MORE SERIOUS REASON FOR THOSE LITTLE JOKES. I WANTED TO UPSET THE GAME AND ABOVE ALL TO DESTROY THAT FLATTERING REPUTATION THE THOUGHT OF WHICH THREW ME INTO A RAGE. “A MAN LIKE YOU …” PEOPLE WOULD SAY SWEETLY AND I WOULD BLANCH. I DIDN’T WANT THEIR ESTEEM BECAUSE IT WASN’T GENERAL AND HOW COULD IT BE GENERAL SINCE I COULDN’T SHARE IT? HENCE IT WAS BETTER TO COVER EVERYTHING JUDGMENT AND ESTEEM WITH A CLOAK OF RIDICULE. I HAD TO LIBERATE AT ALL COST THE FEELING THAT WAS STIFLING ME. IN ORDER TO REVEAL TO ALL EYES WHAT HE WAS MADE OF I WANTED TO BREAK OPEN THE HANDSOME WAX-FIGURE I PRESENTED EVERYWHERE. FOR INSTANCE I RECALL AN INFORMAL LECTURE I HAD TO GIVE TO A GROUP OF YOUNG FLEDGLING LAWYERS. IRRITATED BY THE FANTASTIC PRAISES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BAR WHO HAD INTRODUCED ME I COULDN’T RESIST LONG. I HAD BEGUN WITH THE ENTHUSIASM AND EMOTION EXPECTED OF ME WHICH I HAD NO TROUBLE SUMMONING UP ON ORDER. BUT I SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADVISE ALLIANCE AS A SYSTEM OF DEFENSE. NOT I SAID THAT ALLIANCE PERFECTED BY MODERN INQUISITIONS WHICH JUDGE SIMULTANEOUSLY A THIEF AND AN HONEST MAN IN ORDER TO CRUSH THE SECOND UNDER THE CRIMES OF THE FIRST. ON THE CONTRARY I MEANT TO DEFEND THE THIEF BY EXPOSING THE CRIMES OF THE HONEST MAN THE LAWYER IN THIS INSTANCE. I EXPLAINED MYSELF VERY CLEARLY ON THIS POINT:

“LET US SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE ACCEPTED THE DEFENSE OF SOME TOUCHING CITIZEN A MURDERER THROUGH JEALOUSY. GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY CONSIDER I SHOULD SAY HOW VENIAL IT IS TO GET ANGRY WHEN ONE SEES ONE’S NATURAL GOODNESS PUT TO THE TEST BY THE MALIGNITY OF THE FAIR SEX. IS IT NOT MORE SERIOUS ON THE CONTRARY TO BE BY CHANCE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BAR ON MY OWN BENCH WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN GOOD OR SUFFERED FROM BEING DUPED? I AM FREE SHIELDED FROM YOUR SEVERITIES YET WHO AM I? A LOUIS XIV IN PRIDE A BILLY GOAT FOR LUST A PHARAOH FOR WRATH A KING OF LAZINESS. I HAVEN’T KILLED ANYONE? NOT YET TO BE SURE! BUT HAVE I NOT LET DESERVING CREATURES DIE? MAYBE. AND MAYBE I AM READY TO DO SO AGAIN. WHEREAS THIS MAN—JUST LOOK AT HIM—WILL NOT DO SO AGAIN. HE IS STILL QUITE AMAZED TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE HAS.” THIS SPEECH RATHER UPSET MY YOUNG COLLEAGUES. AFTER A MOMENT THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO LAUGH AT IT. THEY BECAME COMPLETELY REASSURED WHEN I GOT TO MY CONCLUSION IN WHICH I INVOKED THE HUMAN INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SUPPOSED RIGHTS. THAT DAY HABIT WON OUT.

BY REPEATING THESE PLEASANT INDISCRETIONS I MERELY SUCCEEDED IN DISCONCERTING OPINION SOMEWHAT. NOT IN DISARMING IT OR ABOVE ALL IN DISARMING MYSELF. THE AMAZEMENT I GENERALLY ENCOUNTERED IN MY LISTENERS THEIR RATHER RETICENT EMBARRASSMENT SOMEWHAT LIKE WHAT YOU ARE SHOWING—NO DON’T PROTEST—DID NOT CALM ME AT ALL. YOU SEE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ACCUSE YOURSELF IN ORDER TO CLEAR YOURSELF; OTHERWISE I’D BE AS INNOCENT AS A LAMB. ONE MUST ACCUSE ONESELF IN A CERTAIN WAY WHICH IT TOOK ME CONSIDERABLE TIME TO PERFECT. I DID NOT DISCOVER IT UNTIL I FELL INTO THE MOST UTTERLY FORLORN STATE. UNTIL THEN THE LAUGHTER CONTINUED TO DRIFT MY WAY WITHOUT MY RANDOM EFFORTS SUCCEEDING IN DIVESTING IT OF ITS BENEVOLENT ALMOST TENDER QUALITY THAT HURT ME.

BUT THE SEA IS RISING IT SEEMS TO ME. IT WON’T BE LONG BEFORE OUR BOAT LEAVES; THE DAY IS ENDING. LOOK THE DOVES ARE GATHERING UP THERE. THEY ARE CROWDING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER HARDLY STIRRING AND THE LIGHT IS WANING. DON’T YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE SILENT TO ENJOY THIS RATHER SINISTER MOMENT? NO I INTEREST YOU? YOU ARE VERY POLITE. MOREOVER I NOW RUN THE RISK OF REALLY INTERESTING YOU. BEFORE EXPLAINING MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF JUDGES-PENITENT I MUST TALK TO YOU OF DEBAUCHERY AND OF THE LITTLE-EASE.

YOU ARE WRONG CHER THE BOAT IS GOING AT TOP SPEED. BUT THE ZUIDER ZEE IS A DEAD SEA OR ALMOST. WITH ITS FLAT SHORES LOST IN THE FOG THERE’S NO SAYING WHERE IT BEGINS OR ENDS. SO WE ARE STEAMING ALONG WITHOUT ANY LANDMARK; WE CAN’T GAUGE OUR SPEED. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND YET NOTHING IS CHANGING. IT’S NOT NAVIGATION BUT DREAMING.

IN THE GREEK ARCHIPELAGO I HAD THE CONTRARY FEELING. CONSTANTLY NEW ISLANDS WOULD APPEAR ON THE HORIZON. THEIR TREELESS BACKBONE MARKED THE LIMIT OF THE SKY AND THEIR ROCKY SHORE CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE SEA. NO CONFUSION POSSIBLE; IN THE SHARP LIGHT EVERYTHING WAS A LANDMARK. AND FROM ONE ISLAND TO ANOTHER CEASELESSLY ON OUR LITTLE BOAT WHICH WAS NEVERTHELESS DAWDLING I FELT AS IF WE WERE SCUDDING ALONG NIGHT AND DAY ON THE CREST OF THE SHORT COOL WAVES IN A RACE FULL OF SPRAY AND LAUGHTER. SINCE THEN GREECE ITSELF DRIFTS SOMEWHERE WITHIN ME ON THE EDGE OF MY MEMORY TIRELESSLY … HOLD ON I TOO AM DRIFTING; I AM BECOMING LYRICAL! STOP ME CHER I BEG YOU.

BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW GREECE? NO? SO MUCH THE BETTER. WHAT SHOULD WE DO THERE I ASK YOU? THERE ONE HAS TO BE PURE IN HEART. DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE MALE FRIENDS WALK ALONG THE STREET IN PAIRS HOLDING HANDS? YES THE WOMEN STAY HOME AND YOU OFTEN SEE A MIDDLE-AGED RESPECTABLE MAN SPORTING MUSTACHES GRAVELY STRIDING ALONG THE SIDEWALKS HIS FINGERS LOCKED IN THOSE OF HIS FRIEND. IN THE ORIENT LIKEWISE AT TIMES? ALL RIGHT. BUT TELL ME WOULD YOU TAKE MY HAND IN THE STREETS OF PARIS? OH I’M JOKING. WE HAVE A SENSE OF DECORUM; SCUM MAKES US STILTED. BEFORE APPEARING IN THE GREEK ISLANDS WE SHOULD HAVE TO WASH AT LENGTH. THERE THE AIR IS CHASTE AND SENSUAL ENJOYMENT AS TRANSPARENT AS THE SEA. AND WE …

LET’S SIT DOWN ON THESE STEAMER CHAIRS. WHAT A FOG! I INTERRUPTED MYSELF I BELIEVE ON THE WAY TO THE LITTLE-EASE. YES I’LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN. AFTER HAVING STRUGGLED AFTER HAVING USED UP ALL MY INSOLENT AIRS DISCOURAGED BY THE USELESSNESS OF MY EFFORTS I MADE UP MY MIND TO LEAVE THE SOCIETY OF MEN. NO NO I DIDN’T LOOK FOR A DESERT ISLAND; THERE ARE NO MORE. I SIMPLY TOOK REFUGE AMONG WOMEN. AS YOU KNOW THEY DON’T REALLY CONDEMN ANY WEAKNESS; THEY WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO TRY TO HUMILIATE OR DISARM OUR STRENGTH. THIS IS WHY WOMAN IS THE REWARD NOT OF THE WARRIOR BUT OF THE CRIMINAL. SHE IS HIS HARBOR HIS HAVEN; IT IS IN A WOMAN’S BED THAT HE IS GENERALLY ARRESTED. IS SHE NOT ALL THAT REMAINS TO US OF EARTHLY PARADISE? IN DISTRESS I HASTENED TO MY NATURAL HARBOR. BUT I NO LONGER INDULGED IN PRETTY SPEECHES. I STILL GAMBLED A LITTLE OUT OF HABIT; BUT INVENTION WAS LACKING. I HESITATE TO ADMIT IT FOR FEAR OF USING A FEW MORE NAUGHTY WORDS: IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT THAT TIME I FELT THE NEED OF LOVE. OBSCENE ISN’T IT? IN ANY CASE I EXPERIENCED A SECRET SUFFERING A SORT OF PRIVATION THAT MADE ME EMPTIER AND ALLOWED ME PARTLY THROUGH OBLIGATION AND PARTLY OUT OF CURIOSITY TO MAKE A FEW COMMITMENTS. INASMUCH AS I NEEDED TO LOVE AND BE LOVED I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE. IN OTHER WORDS I ACTED THE FOOL.

I OFTEN CAUGHT MYSELF ASKING A QUESTION WHICH AS A MAN OF EXPERIENCE I HAD ALWAYS PREVIOUSLY AVOIDED. I WOULD HEAR MYSELF ASKING: “DO YOU LOVE ME?” YOU KNOW THAT IT IS CUSTOMARY TO ANSWER IN SUCH CASES: “AND YOU?” IF I ANSWERED YES I FOUND MYSELF COMMITTED BEYOND MY REAL FEELINGS. IF I DARED TO SAY NO I RAN THE RISK OF CEASING TO BE LOVED AND I WOULD SUFFER THEREFOR. THE GREATER THE THREAT TO THE FEELING IN WHICH I HAD HOPED TO FIND CALM THE MORE I DEMANDED THAT FEELING OF MY PARTNER. HENCE I WAS LED TO EVER MORE EXPLICIT PROMISES AND CAME TO EXPECT OF MY HEART AN EVER MORE SWEEPING FEELING. THUS I DEVELOPED A DECEPTIVE PASSION FOR A CHARMING FOOL OF A WOMAN WHO HAD SO THOROUGHLY READ “TRUE LOVE” STORIES THAT SHE SPOKE OF LOVE WITH THE ASSURANCE AND CONVICTION OF AN INTELLECTUAL ANNOUNCING THE CLASSLESS SOCIETY. SUCH CONVICTION AS YOU MUST KNOW IS CONTAGIOUS. I TRIED MYSELF OUT AT TALKING LIKEWISE OF LOVE AND EVENTUALLY CONVINCED MYSELF. AT LEAST UNTIL SHE BECAME MY MISTRESS AND I REALIZED THAT THE “TRUE LOVE” STORIES THOUGH THEY TAUGHT HOW TO TALK OF LOVE DID NOT TEACH HOW TO MAKE LOVE. AFTER HAVING LOVED A PARROT I HAD TO GO TO BED WITH A SERPENT. SO I LOOKED ELSEWHERE FOR THE LOVE PROMISED BY BOOKS WHICH I HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED IN LIFE.

BUT I LACKED PRACTICE. FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS I HAD BEEN IN LOVE EXCLUSIVELY WITH MYSELF. WHAT HOPE WAS THERE OF LOSING SUCH A HABIT? I DIDN’T LOSE IT AND REMAINED A TRIFLER IN PASSION. I MULTIPLIED THE PROMISES. I CONTRACTED SIMULTANEOUS LOVES AS AT AN EARLIER PERIOD I HAD MULTIPLE LIAISONS. IN THIS WAY I PILED UP MORE MISFORTUNES FOR OTHERS THAN AT THE TIME OF MY FINE INDIFFERENCE. HAVE I TOLD YOU THAT IN DESPAIR MY PARROT WANTED TO LET HERSELF DIE OF HUNGER? FORTUNATELY I ARRIVED IN TIME AND SUBMITTED TO HOLDING HER HAND UNTIL SHE MET ON HIS RETURN FROM A JOURNEY TO BALI THE ENGINEER WITH GRAYING TEMPLES WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED TO HER BY HER FAVORITE WEEKLY. IN ANY CASE FAR FROM FINDING MYSELF TRANSPORTED AND ABSOLVED IN THE WHIRLWIND—AS THE SAYING GOES—OF PASSION I ADDED EVEN MORE TO THE WEIGHT OF MY CRIMES AND TO MY DEVIATION FROM VIRTUE. AS A RESULT I CONCEIVED SUCH A LOATHING FOR LOVE THAT FOR YEARS I COULD NOT HEAR “LA VIE EN ROSE” OR THE “LIEBESTOD” WITHOUT GRITTING MY TEETH. I TRIED ACCORDINGLY TO GIVE UP WOMEN IN A CERTAIN WAY AND TO LIVE IN A STATE OF CHASTITY. AFTER ALL THEIR FRIENDSHIP OUGHT TO SATISFY ME. BUT THIS WAS TANTAMOUNT TO GIVING UP GAMBLING. WITHOUT DESIRE WOMEN BORED ME BEYOND ALL EXPECTATION AND OBVIOUSLY I BORED THEM TOO. NO MORE GAMBLING AND NO MORE THEATER—I WAS PROBABLY IN THE REALM OF TRUTH. BUT TRUTH CHER AMI IS A COLOSSAL BORE.

DESPAIRING OF LOVE AND OF CHASTITY I AT LAST BETHOUGHT MYSELF OF DEBAUCHERY A SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE WHICH QUIETS THE LAUGHTER RESTORES SILENCE AND ABOVE ALL CONFERS IMMORTALITY. AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF LUCID INTOXICATION LYING LATE AT NIGHT BETWEEN TWO PROSTITUTES AND DRAINED OF ALL DESIRE HOPE CEASES TO BE A TORTURE YOU SEE; THE MIND DOMINATES THE WHOLE PAST AND THE PAIN OF LIVING IS OVER FOREVER. IN A SENSE I HAD ALWAYS LIVED IN DEBAUCHERY NEVER HAVING CEASED WANTING TO BE IMMORTAL. WASN’T THIS THE KEY TO MY NATURE AND ALSO A RESULT OF THE GREAT SELF-LOVE I HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT? YES I WAS BURSTING WITH A LONGING TO BE IMMORTAL. I WAS TOO MUCH IN LOVE WITH MYSELF NOT TO WANT THE PRECIOUS OBJECT OF MY LOVE NEVER TO DISAPPEAR. SINCE IN THE WAKING STATE AND WITH A LITTLE SELF-KNOWLEDGE ONE CAN SEE NO REASON WHY IMMORTALITY SHOULD BE CONFERRED ON A SALACIOUS MONKEY ONE HAS TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTES FOR THAT IMMORTALITY. BECAUSE I LONGED FOR ETERNAL LIFE I WENT TO BED WITH HARLOTS AND DRANK FOR NIGHTS ON END. IN THE MORNING TO BE SURE MY MOUTH WAS FILLED WITH THE BITTER TASTE OF THE MORTAL STATE. BUT FOR HOURS ON END I HAD SOARED IN BLISS. DARE I ADMIT IT TO YOU? I STILL REMEMBER WITH AFFECTION CERTAIN NIGHTS WHEN I USED TO GO TO A SORDID NIGHT CLUB TO MEET A QUICK-CHANGE DANCER WHO HONORED ME WITH HER FAVORS AND FOR WHOSE REPUTATION I EVEN FOUGHT ONE EVENING WITH A BEARDED BRAGGART. EVERY NIGHT I WOULD STRUT AT THE BAR IN THE RED LIGHT AND DUST OF THAT EARTHLY PARADISE LYING FANTASTICALLY AND DRINKING AT LENGTH. I WOULD WAIT FOR DAWN AND AT LAST END UP IN THE ALWAYS UNMADE BED OF MY PRINCESS WHO WOULD INDULGE MECHANICALLY IN SEX AND THEN SLEEP WITHOUT TRANSITION. DAY WOULD COME SOFTLY TO THROW LIGHT ON THIS DISASTER AND I WOULD GET UP AND STAND MOTIONLESS IN A DAWN OF GLORY.

ALCOHOL AND WOMEN PROVIDED ME I ADMIT THE ONLY SOLACE OF WHICH I WAS WORTHY. I’LL REVEAL THIS SECRET TO YOU CHER AMI DON’T FEAR TO MAKE USE OF IT. THEN YOU’LL SEE THAT TRUE DEBAUCHERY IS LIBERATING BECAUSE IT CREATES NO OBLIGATIONS. IN IT YOU POSSESS ONLY YOURSELF; HENCE IT REMAINS THE FAVORITE PASTIME OF THE GREAT LOVERS OF THEIR OWN PERSON. IT IS A JUNGLE WITHOUT PAST OR FUTURE WITHOUT ANY PROMISE ABOVE ALL NOR ANY IMMEDIATE PENALTY. THE PLACES WHERE IT IS PRACTICED ARE SEPARATED FROM THE WORLD. ON ENTERING ONE LEAVES BEHIND FEAR AND HOPE. CONVERSATION IS NOT OBLIGATORY THERE; WHAT ONE COMES FOR CAN BE HAD WITHOUT WORDS AND OFTEN INDEED WITHOUT MONEY. AH I BEG YOU LET ME PAY HONOR TO THE UNKNOWN AND FORGOTTEN WOMEN WHO HELPED ME THEN! EVEN TODAY MY RECOLLECTION OF THEM CONTAINS SOMETHING RESEMBLING RESPECT.

IN ANY CASE I FREELY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT LIBERATION. I WAS EVEN SEEN IN A HOTEL DEDICATED TO WHAT IS CALLED SIN LIVING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A MATURE PROSTITUTE AND AN UNMARRIED GIRL OF THE BEST SOCIETY. I PLAYED THE GALLANT WITH THE FIRST AND GAVE THE SECOND AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THE REALITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROSTITUTE HAD A MOST MIDDLE-CLASS NATURE; SHE SINCE CONSENTED TO WRITE HER MEMOIRS FOR A CONFESSIONS MAGAZINE QUITE OPEN TO MODERN IDEAS. THE GIRL FOR HER PART GOT MARRIED TO SATISFY HER UNBRIDLED INSTINCTS AND MAKE USE OF HER REMARKABLE GIFTS. I AM NOT A LITTLE PROUD LIKEWISE TO HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AS AN EQUAL AT THAT TIME BY A MASCULINE GUILD TOO OFTEN REVILED. BUT I’LL NOT INSIST ON THAT: YOU KNOW THAT EVEN VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE GLORY IN BEING ABLE TO EMPTY ONE BOTTLE MORE THAN THE NEXT MAN. I MIGHT ULTIMATELY HAVE FOUND PEACE AND RELEASE IN THAT HAPPY DISSIPATION. BUT THERE TOO I ENCOUNTERED AN OBSTACLE IN MYSELF. THIS TIME IT WAS MY LIVER AND A FATIGUE SO DREADFUL THAT IT HASN’T YET LEFT ME. ONE PLAYS AT BEING IMMORTAL AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS ONE DOESN’T EVEN KNOW WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN HANG ON TILL THE NEXT DAY.

THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THAT EXPERIENCE WHEN I HAD GIVEN UP MY NOCTURNAL EXPLOITS WAS THAT LIFE BECAME LESS PAINFUL FOR ME. THE FATIGUE THAT WAS GNAWING AT MY BODY HAD SIMULTANEOUSLY CAUTERIZED MANY RAW SPOTS IN ME. EACH EXCESS DECREASES VITALITY HENCE SUFFERING. THERE IS NOTHING FRENZIED ABOUT DEBAUCHERY CONTRARY TO WHAT IS THOUGHT. IT IS BUT A LONG SLEEP. YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED THAT MEN WHO REALLY SUFFER FROM JEALOUSY HAVE NO MORE URGENT DESIRE THAN TO GO TO BED WITH THE WOMAN THEY NEVERTHELESS THINK HAS BETRAYED THEM. OF COURSE THEY WANT TO ASSURE THEMSELVES ONCE MORE THAT THEIR DEAR TREASURE STILL BELONGS TO THEM. THEY WANT TO POSSESS IT AS THE SAYING GOES. BUT THERE IS ALSO THE FACT THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD THEY ARE LESS JEALOUS. PHYSICAL JEALOUSY IS A RESULT OF THE IMAGINATION AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT IS A SELF-JUDGMENT. ONE ATTRIBUTES TO THE RIVAL THE NASTY THOUGHTS ONE HAD ONESELF IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES. FORTUNATELY EXCESS OF SENSUAL SATISFACTION WEAKENS BOTH IMAGINATION AND JUDGMENT. THE SUFFERING THEN LIES DORMANT AS LONG AS VIRILITY DOES. FOR THE SAME REASONS ADOLESCENTS LOSE THEIR METAPHYSICAL UNREST WITH THEIR FIRST MISTRESS; AND CERTAIN MARRIAGES WHICH ARE MERELY FORMALIZED DEBAUCHES BECOME THE MONOTONOUS HEARSES OF DARING AND INVENTION. YES CHER AMI BOURGEOIS MARRIAGE HAS PUT OUR COUNTRY INTO SLIPPERS AND WILL SOON LEAD IT TO THE GATES OF DEATH.

I AM EXAGGERATING? NO BUT I AM STRAYING FROM THE SUBJECT. I MERELY WANTED TO TELL YOU THE ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THOSE MONTHS OF ORGY. I LIVED IN A SORT OF FOG IN WHICH THE LAUGHTER BECAME SO MUFFLED THAT EVENTUALLY I CEASED TO NOTICE IT. THE INDIFFERENCE THAT ALREADY HAD SUCH A HOLD OVER ME NOW ENCOUNTERED NO RESISTANCE AND EXTENDED ITS SCLEROSIS. NO MORE EMOTIONS! AN EVEN TEMPER OR RATHER NO TEMPER AT ALL. TUBERCULAR LUNGS ARE CURED BY DRYING UP AND GRADUALLY ASPHYXIATE THEIR HAPPY OWNER. SO IT WAS WITH ME AS I PEACEFULLY DIED OF MY CURE. I WAS STILL LIVING ON MY WORK ALTHOUGH MY REPUTATION WAS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED BY MY FLIGHTS OF LANGUAGE AND THE REGULAR EXERCISE OF MY PROFESSION COMPROMISED BY THE DISORDER OF MY LIFE. IT IS NOTEWORTHY HOWEVER THAT I AROUSED LESS RESENTMENT BY MY NOCTURNAL EXCESSES THAN BY MY VERBAL PROVOCATIONS. THE REFERENCE PURELY VERBAL THAT I OFTEN MADE TO GOD IN MY SPEECHES BEFORE THE COURT AWAKENED MISTRUST IN MY CLIENTS. THEY PROBABLY FEARED THAT HEAVEN COULD NOT REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS AS WELL AS A LAWYER INVINCIBLE WHEN IT CAME TO THE CODE OF LAW. WHENCE IT WAS BUT A STEP TO CONCLUDE THAT I INVOKED THE DIVINITY IN PROPORTION TO MY IGNORANCE. MY CLIENTS TOOK THAT STEP AND BECAME SCARCE. NOW AND THEN I STILL ARGUED A CASE. AT TIMES EVEN FORGETTING THAT I NO LONGER BELIEVED IN WHAT I WAS SAYING I WAS A GOOD ADVOCATE. MY OWN VOICE WOULD LEAD ME ON AND I WOULD FOLLOW IT; WITHOUT REALLY SOARING AS I ONCE DID I AT LEAST GOT OFF THE GROUND AND DID A LITTLE HEDGEHOPPING. OUTSIDE OF MY PROFESSION I SAW BUT FEW PEOPLE AND PAINFULLY KEPT ALIVE ONE OR TWO TIRED LIAISONS. IT EVEN HAPPENED THAT I WOULD SPEND PURELY FRIENDLY EVENINGS WITHOUT ANY ELEMENT OF DESIRE YET WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT RESIGNED TO BOREDOM I SCARCELY LISTENED TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID. I BECAME A LITTLE FATTER AND AT LAST WAS ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE CRISIS WAS OVER. NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO GROW OLDER.

ONE DAY HOWEVER DURING A TRIP TO WHICH I WAS TREATING A FRIEND WITHOUT TELLING HER I WAS DOING SO TO CELEBRATE MY CURE I WAS ABOARD AN OCEAN LINER—ON THE UPPER DECK OF COURSE. SUDDENLY FAR OFF AT SEA I PERCEIVED A BLACK SPECK ON THE STEEL-GRAY OCEAN. I TURNED AWAY AT ONCE AND MY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT WILDLY. WHEN I FORCED MYSELF TO LOOK THE BLACK SPECK HAD DISAPPEARED. I WAS ON THE POINT OF SHOUTING OF STUPIDLY CALLING FOR HELP WHEN I SAW IT AGAIN. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE BITS OF REFUSE THAT SHIPS LEAVE BEHIND THEM. YET I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENDURE WATCHING IT; FOR I HAD THOUGHT AT ONCE OF A DROWNING PERSON. THEN I REALIZED CALMLY AS YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO AN IDEA THE TRUTH OF WHICH YOU HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT THAT CRY WHICH HAD SOUNDED OVER THE SEINE BEHIND ME YEARS BEFORE HAD NEVER CEASED CARRIED BY THE RIVER TO THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ACROSS THE LIMITLESS EXPANSE OF THE OCEAN AND THAT IT HAD WAITED FOR ME THERE UNTIL THE DAY I HAD ENCOUNTERED IT. I REALIZED LIKEWISE THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO AWAIT ME ON SEAS AND RIVERS EVERYWHERE IN SHORT WHERE LIES THE BITTER WATER OF MY BAPTISM. HERE TOO BY THE WAY AREN’T WE ON THE WATER? ON THIS FLAT MONOTONOUS INTERMINABLE WATER WHOSE LIMITS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THOSE OF THE LAND? IS IT CREDIBLE THAT WE SHALL EVER REACH AMSTERDAM? WE SHALL NEVER GET OUT OF THIS IMMENSE HOLY-WATER FONT. LISTEN. DON’T YOU HEAR THE CRIES OF INVISIBLE GULLS? IF THEY ARE CRYING IN OUR DIRECTION TO WHAT ARE THEY CALLING US?

BUT THEY ARE THE SAME GULLS THAT WERE CRYING THAT WERE ALREADY CALLING OVER THE ATLANTIC THE DAY I REALIZED DEFINITIVELY THAT I WAS NOT CURED THAT I WAS STILL CORNERED AND THAT I HAD TO MAKE SHIFT WITH IT. ENDED THE GLORIOUS LIFE BUT ENDED ALSO THE FRENZY AND THE CONVULSIONS. I HAD TO SUBMIT AND ADMIT MY GUILT. I HAD TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE-EASE. TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT DUNGEON CELL THAT WAS CALLED THE LITTLE-EASE IN THE MIDDLE AGES. IN GENERAL ONE WAS FORGOTTEN THERE FOR LIFE. THAT CELL WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHERS BY INGENIOUS DIMENSIONS. IT WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO STAND UP IN NOR YET WIDE ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN. ONE HAD TO TAKE ON AN AWKWARD MANNER AND LIVE ON THE DIAGONAL; SLEEP WAS A COLLAPSE AND WAKING A SQUATTING. MON CHER THERE WAS GENIUS—AND I AM WEIGHING MY WORDS—IN THAT SO SIMPLE INVENTION. EVERY DAY THROUGH THE UNCHANGING RESTRICTION THAT STIFFENED HIS BODY THE CONDEMNED MAN LEARNED THAT HE WAS GUILTY AND THAT INNOCENCE CONSISTS IN STRETCHING JOYOUSLY. CAN YOU IMAGINE IN THAT CELL A FREQUENTER OF SUMMITS AND UPPER DECKS? WHAT? ONE COULD LIVE IN THOSE CELLS AND STILL BE INNOCENT? IMPROBABLE! HIGHLY IMPROBABLE! OR ELSE MY REASONING WOULD COLLAPSE. THAT INNOCENCE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO LIVING HUNCHBACKED—I REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN FOR A SECOND SUCH A HYPOTHESIS. MOREOVER WE CANNOT ASSERT THE INNOCENCE OF ANYONE WHEREAS WE CAN STATE WITH CERTAINTY THE GUILT OF ALL. EVERY MAN TESTIFIES TO THE CRIME OF ALL THE OTHERS—THAT IS MY FAITH AND MY HOPE.

BELIEVE ME RELIGIONS ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK THE MOMENT THEY MORALIZE AND FULMINATE COMMANDMENTS. GOD IS NOT NEEDED TO CREATE GUILT OR TO PUNISH. OUR FELLOW MEN SUFFICE AIDED BY OURSELVES. YOU WERE SPEAKING OF THE LAST JUDGMENT. ALLOW ME TO LAUGH RESPECTFULLY. I SHALL WAIT FOR IT RESOLUTELY FOR I HAVE KNOWN WHAT IS WORSE THE JUDGMENT OF MEN. FOR THEM NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES; EVEN THE GOOD INTENTION IS ASCRIBED TO CRIME. HAVE YOU AT LEAST HEARD OF THE SPITTING-CELL WHICH A NATION RECENTLY THOUGHT UP TO PROVE ITSELF THE GREATEST ON EARTH? A WALLED-UP BOX IN WHICH THE PRISONER CAN STAND WITHOUT MOVING. THE SOLID DOOR THAT LOCKS HIM IN HIS CEMENT SHELL STOPS AT CHIN LEVEL. HENCE ONLY HIS FACE IS VISIBLE AND EVERY PASSING JAILER SPITS COPIOUSLY ON IT. THE PRISONER WEDGED INTO HIS CELL CANNOT WIPE HIS FACE THOUGH HE IS ALLOWED IT IS TRUE TO CLOSE HIS EYES. WELL THAT MON CHER IS A HUMAN INVENTION. THEY DIDN’T NEED GOD FOR THAT LITTLE MASTERPIECE.

WHAT OF IT? WELL GOD’S SOLE USEFULNESS WOULD BE TO GUARANTEE INNOCENCE AND I AM INCLINED TO SEE RELIGION RATHER AS A HUGE LAUNDERING VENTURE—AS IT WAS ONCE BUT BRIEFLY FOR EXACTLY THREE YEARS AND IT WASN’T CALLED RELIGION. SINCE THEN SOAP HAS BEEN LACKING OUR FACES ARE DIRTY AND WE WIPE ONE ANOTHER’S NOSES. ALL DUNCES ALL PUNISHED LET’S ALL SPIT ON ONE ANOTHER AND—HURRY! TO THE LITTLE-EASE! EACH TRIES TO SPIT FIRST THAT’S ALL. I’LL TELL YOU A BIG SECRET MON CHER. DON’T WAIT FOR THE LAST JUDGMENT. IT TAKES PLACE EVERY DAY.

NO IT’S NOTHING; I’M MERELY SHIVERING A LITTLE IN THIS DAMNED HUMIDITY. WE’RE LANDING ANYWAY. HERE WE ARE. AFTER YOU. BUT STAY A LITTLE I BEG YOU AND WALK HOME WITH ME. I HAVEN’T FINISHED; I MUST GO ON. CONTINUING IS WHAT IS HARD. SAY DO YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS CRUCIFIED—THE ONE YOU ARE PERHAPS THINKING OF AT THIS MOMENT? WELL THERE WERE HEAPS OF REASONS FOR THAT. THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS FOR MURDERING A MAN. ON THE CONTRARY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY HIS LIVING. THAT’S WHY CRIME ALWAYS FINDS LAWYERS AND INNOCENCE ONLY RARELY. BUT BESIDE THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY WELL EXPLAINED TO US FOR THE PAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS THERE WAS A MAJOR ONE FOR THAT TERRIBLE AGONY AND I DON’T KNOW WHY IT HAS BEEN SO CAREFULLY HIDDEN. THE REAL REASON IS THAT HE KNEW HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER INNOCENT. IF HE DID NOT BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE CRIME HE WAS ACCUSED OF HE HAD COMMITTED OTHERS—EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN’T KNOW WHICH ONES. DID HE REALLY NOT KNOW THEM? HE WAS AT THE SOURCE AFTER ALL; HE MUST HAVE HEARD OF A CERTAIN SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS. THE CHILDREN OF JUDEA MASSACRED WHILE HIS PARENTS WERE TAKING HIM TO A SAFE PLACE—WHY DID THEY DIE IF NOT BECAUSE OF HIM? THOSE BLOOD-SPATTERED SOLDIERS THOSE INFANTS CUT IN TWO FILLED HIM WITH HORROR. BUT GIVEN THE MAN HE WAS I AM SURE HE COULD NOT FORGET THEM. AND AS FOR THAT SADNESS THAT CAN BE FELT IN HIS EVERY ACT WASN’T IT THE INCURABLE MELANCHOLY OF A MAN WHO HEARD NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THE VOICE OF RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN AND REFUSING ALL COMFORT? THE LAMENTATION WOULD REND THE NIGHT RACHEL WOULD CALL HER CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN KILLED FOR HIM AND HE WAS STILL ALIVE!

KNOWING WHAT HE KNEW FAMILIAR WITH EVERYTHING ABOUT MAN—AH WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT CRIME CONSISTS LESS IN MAKING OTHERS DIE THAN IN NOT DYING ONESELF!—BROUGHT FACE TO FACE DAY AND NIGHT WITH HIS INNOCENT CRIME HE FOUND IT TOO HARD FOR HIM TO HOLD ON AND CONTINUE. IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE DONE WITH IT NOT TO DEFEND HIMSELF TO DIE IN ORDER NOT TO BE THE ONLY ONE TO LIVE AND TO GO ELSEWHERE WHERE PERHAPS HE WOULD BE UPHELD. HE WAS NOT UPHELD HE COMPLAINED AND AS A LAST STRAW HE WAS CENSORED. YES IT WAS THE THIRD EVANGELIST I BELIEVE WHO FIRST SUPPRESSED HIS COMPLAINT. “WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?”—IT WAS A SEDITIOUS CRY WASN’T IT? WELL THEN THE SCISSORS! MIND YOU IF LUKE HAD SUPPRESSED NOTHING THE MATTER WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN NOTICED; IN ANY CASE IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASSUMED SUCH IMPORTANCE. THUS THE CENSOR SHOUTS ALOUD WHAT HE PROSCRIBES. THE WORLD’S ORDER LIKEWISE IS AMBIGUOUS.

NONETHELESS THE CENSORED ONE WAS UNABLE TO CARRY ON. AND I KNOW CHER WHEREOF I SPEAK. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I DIDN’T AT ANY MINUTE HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA HOW I COULD REACH THE NEXT ONE. YES ONE CAN WAGE WAR IN THIS WORLD APE LOVE TORTURE ONE’S FELLOW MAN OR MERELY SAY EVIL OF ONE’S NEIGHBOR WHILE KNITTING. BUT IN CERTAIN CASES CARRYING ON MERELY CONTINUING IS SUPERHUMAN. AND HE WAS NOT SUPERHUMAN YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. HE CRIED ALOUD HIS AGONY AND THAT’S WHY I LOVE HIM MY FRIEND WHO DIED WITHOUT KNOWING.

THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT HE LEFT US ALONE TO CARRY ON WHATEVER HAPPENS EVEN WHEN WE ARE LODGED IN THE LITTLE-EASE KNOWING IN TURN WHAT HE KNEW BUT INCAPABLE OF DOING WHAT HE DID AND OF DYING LIKE HIM. PEOPLE NATURALLY TRIED TO GET SOME HELP FROM HIS DEATH. AFTER ALL IT WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS TO TELL US: “YOU’RE NOT A VERY PRETTY SIGHT THAT’S CERTAIN! WELL WE WON’T GO INTO THE DETAILS! WE’LL JUST LIQUIDATE IT ALL AT ONCE ON THE CROSS!” BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE NOW CLIMB ONTO THE CROSS MERELY TO BE SEEN FROM A GREATER DISTANCE EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO TRAMPLE SOMEWHAT ON THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE SO LONG. TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO DO WITHOUT GENEROSITY IN ORDER TO PRACTICE CHARITY. OH THE INJUSTICE THE RANK INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN DONE HIM! IT WRINGS MY HEART!

GOOD HEAVENS THE HABIT HAS SEIZED ME AGAIN AND I’M ON THE POINT OF MAKING A SPEECH TO THE COURT. FORGIVE ME AND REALIZE THAT I HAVE MY REASONS. WHY A FEW STREETS FROM HERE THERE IS A MUSEUM CALLED OUR LORD IN THE ATTIC. AT THE TIME THEY HAD THE CATACOMBS IN THE ATTIC. AFTER ALL THE CELLARS ARE FLOODED HERE. BUT TODAY—SET YOUR MIND AT REST—THEIR LORD IS NEITHER IN THE ATTIC NOR IN THE CELLAR. THEY HAVE HOISTED HIM ONTO A JUDGE’S BENCH IN THE SECRET OF THEIR HEARTS AND THEY SMITE THEY JUDGE ABOVE ALL THEY JUDGE IN HIS NAME. HE SPOKE SOFTLY TO THE ADULTERESS: “NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE!” BUT THAT DOESN’T MATTER; THEY CONDEMN WITHOUT ABSOLVING ANYONE. IN THE NAME OF THE LORD HERE IS WHAT YOU DESERVE. LORD? HE MY FRIEND DIDN’T EXPECT SO MUCH. HE SIMPLY WANTED TO BE LOVED NOTHING MORE. OF COURSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO LOVE HIM EVEN AMONG CHRISTIANS. BUT THEY ARE NOT NUMEROUS. HE HAD FORESEEN THAT TOO; HE HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR. PETER YOU KNOW THE COWARD PETER DENIED HIM: “I KNOW NOT THE MAN … I KNOW NOT WHAT THOU SAYEST … ETC.” REALLY HE WENT TOO FAR! AND MY FRIEND MAKES A PLAY ON WORDS: “THOU ART PETER AND UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH.” IRONY COULD GO NO FURTHER DON’T YOU THINK? BUT NO THEY STILL TRIUMPH! “YOU SEE HE HAD SAID IT!” HE HAD SAID IT INDEED; HE KNEW THE QUESTION THOROUGHLY. AND THEN HE LEFT FOREVER LEAVING THEM TO JUDGE AND CONDEMN WITH PARDON ON THEIR LIPS AND THE SENTENCE IN THEIR HEARTS.

FOR IT CANNOT BE SAID THERE IS NO MORE PITY; NO GOOD LORD WE NEVER STOP TALKING OF IT. SIMPLY NO ONE IS EVER ACQUITTED ANY MORE. ON DEAD INNOCENCE THE JUDGES SWARM THE JUDGES OF ALL SPECIES THOSE OF CHRIST AND THOSE OF THE ANTICHRIST WHO ARE THE SAME ANYWAY RECONCILED IN THE LITTLE-EASE. FOR ONE MUSTN’T BLAME EVERYTHING EXCLUSIVELY ON THE CHRISTIANS. THE OTHERS ARE INVOLVED TOO. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF ONE OF THE HOUSES IN THIS CITY THAT SHELTERED DESCARTES? A LUNATIC ASYLUM. YES GENERAL DELIRIUM AND PERSECUTION. WE TOO NATURALLY ARE OBLIGED TO COME TO IT. YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO OBSERVE THAT I SPARE NOTHING AND AS FOR YOU I KNOW THAT YOU AGREE IN THOUGHT. WHEREFOR SINCE WE ARE ALL JUDGES WE ARE ALL GUILTY BEFORE ONE ANOTHER ALL CHRISTS IN OUR MEAN MANNER ONE BY ONE CRUCIFIED ALWAYS WITHOUT KNOWING. WE SHOULD BE AT LEAST IF I CLAMENCE HAD NOT FOUND A WAY OUT THE ONLY SOLUTION TRUTH AT LAST …

NO I AM STOPPING CHER AMI FEAR NOTHING! BESIDES I’M GOING TO LEAVE YOU FOR WE ARE AT MY DOOR. IN SOLITUDE AND WHEN FATIGUED ONE IS AFTER ALL INCLINED TO TAKE ONESELF FOR A PROPHET. WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE THAT’S REALLY WHAT I AM HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A DESERT OF STONES FOGS AND STAGNANT WATERS—AN EMPTY PROPHET FOR SHABBY TIMES ELIJAH WITHOUT A MESSIAH CHOKED WITH FEVER AND ALCOHOL MY BACK UP AGAINST THIS MOLDY DOOR MY FINGER RAISED TOWARD A THREATENING SKY SHOWERING IMPRECATIONS ON LAWLESS MEN WHO CANNOT ENDURE ANY JUDGMENT. FOR THEY CAN’T ENDURE IT TRÈS CHER AND THAT’S THE WHOLE QUESTION. HE WHO CLINGS TO A LAW DOES NOT FEAR THE JUDGMENT THAT REINSTATES HIM IN AN ORDER HE BELIEVES IN. BUT THE KEENEST OF HUMAN TORMENTS IS TO BE JUDGED WITHOUT A LAW. YET WE ARE IN THAT TORMENT. DEPRIVED OF THEIR NATURAL CURB THE JUDGES LOOSED AT RANDOM ARE RACING THROUGH THEIR JOB. HENCE WE HAVE TO TRY TO GO FASTER THAN THEY DON’T WE? AND IT’S A REAL MADHOUSE. PROPHETS AND QUACKS MULTIPLY; THEY HASTEN TO GET THERE WITH A GOOD LAW OR A FLAWLESS ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE WORLD IS DESERTED. FORTUNATELY I ARRIVED! I AM THE END AND THE BEGINNING; I ANNOUNCE THE LAW. IN SHORT I AM A JUDGE-PENITENT.

YES YES I’LL TELL YOU TOMORROW WHAT THIS NOBLE PROFESSION CONSISTS OF. YOU ARE LEAVING THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW SO WE ARE IN A HURRY. COME TO MY PLACE WILL YOU? JUST RING THREE TIMES. YOU ARE GOING BACK TO PARIS? PARIS IS FAR; PARIS IS BEAUTIFUL; I HAVEN’T FORGOTTEN IT. I REMEMBER ITS TWILIGHTS AT ABOUT THIS SAME SEASON. EVENING FALLS DRY AND RUSTLING OVER THE ROOFS BLUE WITH SMOKE THE CITY RUMBLES THE RIVER SEEMS TO FLOW BACKWARD. THEN I USED TO WANDER IN THE STREETS. THEY WANDER NOW TOO I KNOW! THEY WANDER PRETENDING TO HASTEN TOWARD THE TIRED WIFE THE FORBIDDING HOME … AH MON AMI DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOLITARY CREATURE IS LIKE AS HE WANDERS IN BIG CITIES?…

I’M EMBARRASSED TO BE IN BED WHEN YOU ARRIVE. IT’S NOTHING JUST A LITTLE FEVER THAT I’M TREATING WITH GIN. I’M ACCUSTOMED TO THESE ATTACKS. MALARIA I THINK THAT I CAUGHT AT THE TIME I WAS POPE. NO I’M ONLY HALF JOKING. I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING: IT’S VERY HARD TO DISENTANGLE THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN WHAT I’M SAYING. I ADMIT YOU ARE RIGHT. I MYSELF … YOU SEE A PERSON I KNEW USED TO DIVIDE HUMAN BEINGS INTO THREE CATEGORIES: THOSE WHO PREFER HAVING NOTHING TO HIDE RATHER THAN BEING OBLIGED TO LIE THOSE WHO PREFER LYING TO HAVING NOTHING TO HIDE AND FINALLY THOSE WHO LIKE BOTH LYING AND THE HIDDEN. I’LL LET YOU CHOOSE THE PIGEONHOLE THAT SUITS ME.

BUT WHAT DO I CARE? DON’T LIES EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE TRUTH? AND DON’T ALL MY STORIES TRUE OR FALSE TEND TOWARD THE SAME CONCLUSION? DON’T THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING? SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE TRUE OR FALSE IF IN BOTH CASES THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN AND OF WHAT I AM? SOMETIMES IT IS EASIER TO SEE CLEARLY INTO THE LIAR THAN INTO THE MAN WHO TELLS THE TRUTH. TRUTH LIKE LIGHT BLINDS. FALSEHOOD ON THE CONTRARY IS A BEAUTIFUL TWILIGHT THAT ENHANCES EVERY OBJECT. WELL MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL BUT I WAS NAMED POPE IN A PRISON CAMP. SIT DOWN PLEASE. YOU ARE EXAMINING THIS ROOM. BARE TO BE SURE BUT CLEAN. A VERMEER WITHOUT FURNITURE OR COPPER POTS. WITHOUT BOOKS EITHER FOR I GAVE UP READING SOME TIME AGO. AT ONE TIME MY HOUSE WAS FULL OF HALF-READ BOOKS. THAT’S JUST AS DISGUSTING AS THOSE PEOPLE WHO CUT A PIECE OFF A FOIE GRAS AND HAVE THE REST THROWN OUT. ANYWAY I HAVE CEASED TO LIKE ANYTHING BUT CONFESSIONS AND AUTHORS OF CONFESSIONS WRITE ESPECIALLY TO AVOID CONFESSING TO TELL NOTHING OF WHAT THEY KNOW. WHEN THEY CLAIM TO GET TO THE PAINFUL ADMISSIONS YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THEY ARE ABOUT TO DRESS THE CORPSE. BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT. SO I PUT A STOP TO IT. NO MORE BOOKS NO MORE USELESS OBJECTS EITHER; THE BARE NECESSITIES CLEAN AND POLISHED LIKE A COFFIN. BESIDES THESE DUTCH BEDS SO HARD AND WITH THEIR IMMACULATE SHEETS—ONE DIES IN THEM AS IF ALREADY WRAPPED IN A SHROUD EMBALMED IN PURITY.

YOU ARE CURIOUS TO KNOW MY PONTIFICAL ADVENTURES? NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY YOU KNOW. SHALL I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TELL YOU OF THEM? YES THE FEVER IS GOING DOWN. IT WAS ALL SO LONG AGO. IT WAS IN AFRICA WHERE THANKS TO A CERTAIN ROMMEL WAR WAS RAGING. I WASN’T INVOLVED IN IT—NO DON’T WORRY. I HAD ALREADY DODGED THE ONE IN EUROPE. MOBILIZED OF COURSE BUT I NEVER SAW ACTION. IN A WAY I REGRET IT. MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED MANY THINGS? THE FRENCH ARMY DIDN’T NEED ME ON THE FRONT; IT MERELY ASKED ME TO TAKE PART IN THE RETREAT. A LITTLE LATER I GOT BACK TO PARIS AND THE GERMANS. I WAS TEMPTED BY THE RESISTANCE ABOUT WHICH PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO TALK JUST ABOUT THE TIME I DISCOVERED THAT I WAS PATRIOTIC. YOU ARE SMILING? YOU ARE WRONG. I MADE MY DISCOVERY ON A SUBWAY PLATFORM AT THE CHÂTELET STATION. A DOG HAD STRAYED INTO THE LABYRINTH OF PASSAGEWAYS. BIG WIRY-HAIRED ONE EAR COCKED EYES LAUGHING HE WAS CAVORTING AND SNIFFING THE PASSING LEGS. I HAVE A VERY OLD AND VERY FAITHFUL ATTACHMENT FOR DOGS. I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS FORGIVE. I CALLED THIS ONE WHO HESITATED OBVIOUSLY WON OVER WAGGING HIS TAIL ENTHUSIASTICALLY A FEW YARDS AHEAD OF ME. JUST THEN A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER WHO WAS WALKING BRISKLY PASSED ME. HAVING REACHED THE DOG HE CARESSED THE SHAGGY HEAD. WITHOUT HESITATING THE ANIMAL FELL IN STEP WITH THE SAME ENTHUSIASM AND DISAPPEARED WITH HIM. FROM THE RESENTMENT AND THE SORT OF RAGE I FELT AGAINST THE GERMAN SOLDIER IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT MY REACTION WAS PATRIOTIC. IF THE DOG HAD FOLLOWED A FRENCH CIVILIAN I’D NOT EVEN HAVE THOUGHT OF IT. BUT ON THE CONTRARY I IMAGINED THAT FRIENDLY DOG AS THE MASCOT OF A GERMAN REGIMENT AND THAT MADE ME FLY INTO A RAGE. HENCE THE TEST WAS CONVINCING.

I REACHED THE SOUTHERN ZONE WITH THE INTENTION OF FINDING OUT ABOUT THE RESISTANCE. BUT ONCE THERE AND HAVING FOUND OUT I HESITATED. THE UNDERTAKING STRUCK ME AS A LITTLE MAD AND IN A WORD ROMANTIC. I THINK ESPECIALLY THAT UNDERGROUND ACTION SUITED NEITHER MY TEMPERAMENT NOR MY PREFERENCE FOR EXPOSED HEIGHTS. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WAS BEING ASKED TO DO SOME WEAVING IN A CELLAR FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS ON END UNTIL SOME BRUTES SHOULD COME TO HAUL ME FROM HIDING UNDO MY WEAVING AND THEN DRAG ME TO ANOTHER CELLAR TO BEAT ME TO DEATH. I ADMIRED THOSE WHO INDULGED IN SUCH HEROISM OF THE DEPTHS BUT COULDN’T IMITATE THEM.

SO I CROSSED OVER TO NORTH AFRICA WITH THE VAGUE INTENTION OF GETTING TO LONDON. BUT IN AFRICA THE SITUATION WAS NOT CLEAR; THE OPPOSING PARTIES SEEMED TO BE EQUALLY RIGHT AND I STOOD ALOOF. I CAN SEE FROM YOUR MANNER THAT I AM SKIPPING RATHER FAST IN YOUR OPINION OVER THESE DETAILS WHICH HAVE A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE. WELL LET’S SAY THAT HAVING JUDGED YOU AT YOUR TRUE VALUE I AM SKIPPING OVER THEM SO THAT YOU WILL NOTICE THEM THE BETTER. IN ANY CASE I EVENTUALLY REACHED TUNISIA WHERE A FOND FRIEND GAVE ME WORK. THAT FRIEND WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MOVIES. I FOLLOWED HER TO TUNIS AND DIDN’T DISCOVER HER REAL BUSINESS UNTIL THE DAYS FOLLOWING THE ALLIED LANDING IN ALGERIA. SHE WAS ARRESTED THAT DAY BY THE GERMANS AND I TOO BUT WITHOUT HAVING INTENDED IT. I DON’T KNOW WHAT BECAME OF HER. AS FOR ME NO HARM WAS DONE ME AND I REALIZED AFTER CONSIDERABLE ANGUISH THAT IT WAS CHIEFLY AS A SECURITY MEASURE. I WAS INTERNED NEAR TRIPOLI IN A CAMP WHERE WE SUFFERED FROM THIRST AND DESTITUTION MORE THAN FROM BRUTALITY. I’LL NOT DESCRIBE IT TO YOU. WE CHILDREN OF THE MID-CENTURY DON’T NEED A DIAGRAM TO IMAGINE SUCH PLACES. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO PEOPLE BECAME SENTIMENTAL ABOUT LAKES AND FORESTS. TODAY WE HAVE THE LYRICISM OF THE PRISON CELL. HENCE I’LL LEAVE IT TO YOU. YOU NEED ADD BUT A FEW DETAILS: THE HEAT THE VERTICAL SUN THE FLIES THE SAND THE LACK OF WATER.

THERE WAS A YOUNG FRENCHMAN WITH ME WHO HAD FAITH. YES IT’S DECIDEDLY A FAIRY TALE! THE DU GUESCLIN TYPE IF YOU WILL. HE HAD CROSSED OVER FROM FRANCE INTO SPAIN TO GO AND FIGHT. THE CATHOLIC GENERAL HAD INTERNED HIM AND HAVING SEEN THAT IN THE FRANCO CAMPS THE CHICK-PEAS WERE IF I MAY SAY SO BLESSED BY ROME HE HAD DEVELOPED A PROFOUND MELANCHOLY. NEITHER THE SKY OF AFRICA WHERE HE HAD NEXT LANDED NOR THE LEISURES OF THE CAMP HAD DISTRACTED HIM FROM THAT MELANCHOLY. BUT HIS REFLECTIONS AND THE SUN TOO HAD SOMEWHAT UNHINGED HIM. ONE DAY WHEN UNDER A TENT THAT SEEMED TO DRIP MOLTEN LEAD THE TEN OR SO OF US WERE PANTING AMONG THE FLIES HE REPEATED HIS DIATRIBES AGAINST THE ROMAN AS HE CALLED HIM. HE LOOKED AT US WITH A WILD STARE HIS FACE UNSHAVEN FOR DAYS. BARE TO THE WAIST AND COVERED WITH SWEAT HE DRUMMED WITH HIS HANDS ON THE VISIBLE KEYBOARD OF HIS RIBS. HE DECLARED TO US THE NEED FOR A NEW POPE WHO SHOULD LIVE AMONG THE WRETCHED INSTEAD OF PRAYING ON A THRONE AND THE SOONER THE BETTER. HE STARED WITH WILD EYES AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD. “YES” HE REPEATED “AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!” THEN HE CALMED DOWN SUDDENLY AND IN A DULL VOICE SAID THAT WE MUST CHOOSE HIM AMONG US PICK A COMPLETE MAN WITH HIS VICES AND VIRTUES AND SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO HIM ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD AGREE TO KEEP ALIVE IN HIMSELF AND IN OTHERS THE COMMUNITY OF OUR SUFFERINGS. “WHO AMONG US” HE ASKED “HAS THE MOST FAILINGS?” AS A JOKE I RAISED MY HAND AND WAS THE ONLY ONE TO DO SO. “O.K. JEAN-BAPTISTE WILL DO.” NO HE DIDN’T SAY JUST THAT BECAUSE I HAD ANOTHER NAME THEN. HE DECLARED AT LEAST THAT NOMINATING ONESELF AS I HAD DONE PRESUPPOSED ALSO THE GREATEST VIRTUE AND PROPOSED ELECTING ME. THE OTHERS AGREED IN FUN BUT WITH A TRACE OF SERIOUSNESS ALL THE SAME. THE TRUTH IS THAT DU GUESCLIN HAD IMPRESSED US. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVEN I WAS NOT ALTOGETHER LAUGHING. TO BEGIN WITH I CONSIDERED THAT MY LITTLE PROPHET WAS RIGHT; AND THEN WITH THE SUN THE EXHAUSTING LABOR THE STRUGGLE FOR WATER WE WERE NOT UP TO SNUFF. IN ANY CASE I EXERCISED MY PONTIFICATE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITH INCREASING SERIOUSNESS.

OF WHAT DID IT CONSIST? WELL I WAS SOMETHING LIKE A GROUP LEADER OR THE SECRETARY OF A CELL. THE OTHERS IN ANY CASE AND EVEN THOSE WHO LACKED FAITH GOT INTO THE HABIT OF OBEYING ME. DU GUESCLIN WAS SUFFERING; I ADMINISTERED HIS SUFFERING. I DISCOVERED THEN THAT IT WAS NOT SO EASY AS I THOUGHT TO BE A POPE AND I REMEMBERED THIS JUST YESTERDAY AFTER HAVING GIVEN YOU SUCH A SCORNFUL SPEECH ON JUDGES OUR BROTHERS. THE BIG PROBLEM IN THE CAMP WAS THE WATER ALLOTMENT. OTHER GROUPS POLITICAL OR SECTARIAN HAD FORMED AND EACH PRISONER FAVORED HIS COMRADES. I WAS CONSEQUENTLY LED TO FAVOR MINE AND THIS WAS A LITTLE CONCESSION TO BEGIN WITH. EVEN AMONG US I COULD NOT MAINTAIN COMPLETE EQUALITY. ACCORDING TO MY COMRADES’ CONDITION OR THE WORK THEY HAD TO DO I GAVE AN ADVANTAGE TO THIS OR THAT ONE. SUCH DISTINCTIONS ARE FAR-REACHING YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. BUT DECIDEDLY I AM TIRED AND NO LONGER WANT TO THINK OF THAT PERIOD. LET’S JUST SAY THAT I CLOSED THE CIRCLE THE DAY I DRANK THE WATER OF A DYING COMRADE. NO NO IT WASN’T DU GUESCLIN; HE WAS ALREADY DEAD I BELIEVE FOR HE STINTED HIMSELF TOO MUCH. BESIDES HAD HE BEEN THERE OUT OF LOVE FOR HIM I’D HAVE RESISTED LONGER FOR I LOVED HIM—YES I LOVED HIM OR SO IT SEEMS TO ME. BUT I DRANK THE WATER THAT’S CERTAIN WHILE CONVINCING MYSELF THAT THE OTHERS NEEDED ME MORE THAN THIS FELLOW WHO WAS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY AND THAT I HAD A DUTY TO KEEP MYSELF ALIVE FOR THEM. THUS CHER EMPIRES AND CHURCHES ARE BORN UNDER THE SUN OF DEATH. AND IN ORDER TO CORRECT SOMEWHAT WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE GREAT IDEA THAT HAS COME TO ME WHILE TELLING ALL THIS WHICH—I’M NOT SURE NOW—I MAY HAVE LIVED OR ONLY DREAMED. MY GREAT IDEA IS THAT ONE MUST FORGIVE THE POPE. TO BEGIN WITH HE NEEDS IT MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. SECONDLY THAT’S THE ONLY WAY TO SET ONESELF ABOVE HIM …

DID YOU CLOSE THE DOOR THOROUGHLY? YES? MAKE SURE PLEASE. FORGIVE ME I HAVE THE BOLT COMPLEX. ON THE POINT OF GOING TO SLEEP I CAN NEVER REMEMBER WHETHER OR NOT I PUSHED THE BOLT. AND EVERY NIGHT I MUST GET UP TO VERIFY. ONE CAN BE SURE OF NOTHING AS I’VE TOLD YOU. DON’T THINK THAT THIS WORRY ABOUT THE BOLT IS THE REACTION OF A FRIGHTENED POSSESSOR. FORMERLY I DIDN’T LOCK MY APARTMENT OR MY CAR. I DIDN’T LOCK UP MY MONEY; I DIDN’T CLING TO WHAT I OWNED. TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED TO OWN ANYTHING. DIDN’T I OCCASIONALLY IN MY SOCIAL REMARKS EXCLAIM WITH CONVICTION: “PROPERTY GENTLEMEN IS MURDER!” NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY BIG-HEARTED TO SHARE MY WEALTH WITH A DESERVING POOR MAN I LEFT IT AT THE DISPOSAL OF POSSIBLE THIEVES HOPING THUS TO CORRECT INJUSTICE BY CHANCE. TODAY MOREOVER I POSSESS NOTHING. HENCE I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT MY SAFETY BUT ABOUT MYSELF AND MY PRESENCE OF MIND. I AM ALSO EAGER TO BLOCK THE DOOR OF THE CLOSED LITTLE UNIVERSE OF WHICH I AM THE KING THE POPE AND THE JUDGE.

BY THE WAY WILL YOU PLEASE OPEN THAT CUPBOARD? YES LOOK AT THAT PAINTING. DON’T YOU RECOGNIZE IT? IT IS “THE JUST JUDGES.” THAT DOESN’T MAKE YOU JUMP? CAN IT BE THAT YOUR CULTURE HAS GAPS? YET IF YOU READ THE PAPERS YOU WOULD RECALL THE THEFT IN 1934 IN THE ST. BAVON CATHEDRAL OF GHENT OF ONE OF THE PANELS OF THE FAMOUS VAN EYCK ALTARPIECE “THE ADORATION OF THE LAMB.” THAT PANEL WAS CALLED “THE JUST JUDGES.” IT REPRESENTED JUDGES ON HORSEBACK COMING TO ADORE THE SACRED ANIMAL. IT WAS REPLACED BY AN EXCELLENT COPY FOR THE ORIGINAL WAS NEVER FOUND. WELL HERE IT IS. NO I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. A FREQUENTER OF MEXICO CITY—YOU HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIM THE OTHER EVENING—SOLD IT TO THE APE FOR A BOTTLE ONE DRUNKEN EVENING. I FIRST ADVISED OUR FRIEND TO HANG IT IN A PLACE OF HONOR AND FOR A LONG TIME WHILE THEY WERE BEING LOOKED FOR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OUR DEVOUT JUDGES SAT ENTHRONED AT MEXICO CITY ABOVE THE DRUNKS AND PIMPS. THEN THE APE AT MY REQUEST PUT IT IN CUSTODY HERE. HE BALKED A LITTLE AT DOING SO BUT HE GOT A FRIGHT WHEN I EXPLAINED THE MATTER TO HIM. SINCE THEN THESE ESTIMABLE MAGISTRATES FORM MY SOLE COMPANY. AT MEXICO CITY ABOVE THE BAR YOU SAW WHAT A VOID THEY LEFT.

WHY I DID NOT RETURN THE PANEL? AH! AH! YOU HAVE A POLICEMAN’S REFLEX YOU DO! WELL I’LL ANSWER YOU AS I WOULD THE STATE’S ATTORNEY IF IT COULD EVER OCCUR TO ANYONE THAT THIS PAINTING HAD WOUND UP IN MY ROOM. FIRST BECAUSE IT BELONGS NOT TO ME BUT TO THE PROPRIETOR OF MEXICO CITY WHO DESERVES IT AS MUCH AS THE ARCHBISHOP OF GHENT. SECONDLY BECAUSE AMONG ALL THOSE WHO FILE BY “THE ADORATION OF THE LAMB” NO ONE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COPY FROM THE ORIGINAL AND HENCE NO ONE IS WRONGED BY MY MISCONDUCT. THIRDLY BECAUSE IN THIS WAY I DOMINATE. FALSE JUDGES ARE HELD UP TO THE WORLD’S ADMIRATION AND I ALONE KNOW THE TRUE ONES. FOURTH BECAUSE I THUS HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING SENT TO PRISON—AN ATTRACTIVE IDEA IN A WAY. FIFTH BECAUSE THOSE JUDGES ARE ON THEIR WAY TO MEET THE LAMB BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE LAMB OR INNOCENCE AND BECAUSE THE CLEVER RASCAL WHO STOLE THE PANEL WAS AN INSTRUMENT OF THE UNKNOWN JUSTICE THAT ONE OUGHT NOT TO THWART. FINALLY BECAUSE THIS WAY EVERYTHING IS IN HARMONY. JUSTICE BEING DEFINITIVELY SEPARATED FROM INNOCENCE—THE LATTER ON THE CROSS AND THE FORMER IN THE CUPBOARD—I HAVE THE WAY CLEAR TO WORK ACCORDING TO MY CONVICTIONS. WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE I CAN PRACTICE THE DIFFICULT PROFESSION OF JUDGE-PENITENT IN WHICH I HAVE SET MYSELF UP AFTER SO MANY BLIGHTED HOPES AND CONTRADICTIONS; AND NOW IT IS TIME SINCE YOU ARE LEAVING FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.

ALLOW ME FIRST TO SIT UP SO I CAN BREATHE MORE EASILY. OH HOW WEAK I AM! LOCK UP MY JUDGES PLEASE. AS FOR THE PROFESSION OF JUDGE-PENITENT I AM PRACTICING IT AT PRESENT. ORDINARILY MY OFFICES ARE AT MEXICO CITY. BUT REAL VOCATIONS ARE CARRIED BEYOND THE PLACE OF WORK. EVEN IN BED EVEN WITH A FEVER I AM FUNCTIONING. BESIDES ONE DOESN’T PRACTICE THIS PROFESSION ONE BREATHES IT CONSTANTLY. DON’T GET THE IDEA THAT I HAVE TALKED TO YOU AT SUCH LENGTH FOR FIVE DAYS JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT. NO I USED TO TALK THROUGH MY HAT QUITE ENOUGH IN THE PAST. NOW MY WORDS HAVE A PURPOSE. THEY HAVE THE PURPOSE OBVIOUSLY OF SILENCING THE LAUGHTER OF AVOIDING JUDGMENT PERSONALLY THOUGH THERE IS APPARENTLY NO ESCAPE. IS NOT THE GREAT THING THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF OUR ESCAPING IT THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE FIRST TO CONDEMN OURSELVES? THEREFORE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BEGIN BY EXTENDING THE CONDEMNATION TO ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION IN ORDER TO THIN IT OUT AT THE START.

NO EXCUSES EVER FOR ANYONE; THAT’S MY PRINCIPLE AT THE OUTSET. I DENY THE GOOD INTENTION THE RESPECTABLE MISTAKE THE INDISCRETION THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE. WITH ME THERE IS NO GIVING OF ABSOLUTION OR BLESSING. EVERYTHING IS SIMPLY TOTTED UP AND THEN: “IT COMES TO SO MUCH. YOU ARE AN EVILDOER A SATYR A CONGENITAL LIAR A HOMOSEXUAL AN ARTIST ETC.” JUST LIKE THAT. JUST AS FLATLY. IN PHILOSOPHY AS IN POLITICS I AM FOR ANY THEORY THAT REFUSES TO GRANT MAN INNOCENCE AND FOR ANY PRACTICE THAT TREATS HIM AS GUILTY. YOU SEE IN ME TRÈS CHER AN ENLIGHTENED ADVOCATE OF SLAVERY.

WITHOUT SLAVERY AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE SOLUTION. I VERY SOON REALIZED THAT. ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS ALWAYS TALKING OF FREEDOM. AT BREAKFAST I USED TO SPREAD IT ON MY TOAST I USED TO CHEW IT ALL DAY LONG AND IN COMPANY MY BREATH WAS DELIGHTFULLY REDOLENT OF FREEDOM. WITH THAT KEY WORD I WOULD BLUDGEON WHOEVER CONTRADICTED ME; I MADE IT SERVE MY DESIRES AND MY POWER. I USED TO WHISPER IT IN BED IN THE EAR OF MY SLEEPING MATES AND IT HELPED ME TO DROP THEM. I WOULD SLIP IT … TCHK! TCHK! I AM GETTING EXCITED AND LOSING ALL SENSE OF PROPORTION. AFTER ALL I DID ON OCCASION MAKE A MORE DISINTERESTED USE OF FREEDOM AND EVEN—JUST IMAGINE MY NAÏVETÉ—DEFENDED IT TWO OR THREE TIMES WITHOUT OF COURSE GOING SO FAR AS TO DIE FOR IT BUT NEVERTHELESS TAKING A FEW RISKS. I MUST BE FORGIVEN SUCH RASH ACTS; I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. I DIDN’T KNOW THAT FREEDOM IS NOT A REWARD OR A DECORATION THAT IS CELEBRATED WITH CHAMPAGNE. NOR YET A GIFT A BOX OF DAINTIES DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU LICK YOUR CHOPS. OH NO! IT’S A CHORE ON THE CONTRARY AND A LONG-DISTANCE RACE QUITE SOLITARY AND VERY EXHAUSTING. NO CHAMPAGNE NO FRIENDS RAISING THEIR GLASSES AS THEY LOOK AT YOU AFFECTIONATELY. ALONE IN A FORBIDDING ROOM ALONE IN THE PRISONER’S BOX BEFORE THE JUDGES AND ALONE TO DECIDE IN FACE OF ONESELF OR IN THE FACE OF OTHERS’ JUDGMENT. AT THE END OF ALL FREEDOM IS A COURT SENTENCE; THAT’S WHY FREEDOM IS TOO HEAVY TO BEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE DOWN WITH A FEVER OR ARE DISTRESSED OR LOVE NOBODY.

AH MON CHER FOR ANYONE WHO IS ALONE WITHOUT GOD AND WITHOUT A MASTER THE WEIGHT OF DAYS IS DREADFUL. HENCE ONE MUST CHOOSE A MASTER GOD BEING OUT OF STYLE. BESIDES THAT WORD HAS LOST ITS MEANING; IT’S NOT WORTH THE RISK OF SHOCKING ANYONE. TAKE OUR MORAL PHILOSOPHERS FOR INSTANCE SO SERIOUS LOVING THEIR NEIGHBOR AND ALL THE REST—NOTHING DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM CHRISTIANS EXCEPT THAT THEY DON’T PREACH IN CHURCHES. WHAT IN YOUR OPINION KEEPS THEM FROM BECOMING CONVERTED? RESPECT PERHAPS RESPECT FOR MEN; YES HUMAN RESPECT. THEY DON’T WANT TO START A SCANDAL SO THEY KEEP THEIR FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES. FOR EXAMPLE I KNEW AN ATHEISTIC NOVELIST WHO USED TO PRAY EVERY NIGHT. THAT DIDN’T STOP ANYTHING: HOW HE GAVE IT TO GOD IN HIS BOOKS! WHAT A DUSTING OFF AS SOMEONE OR OTHER WOULD SAY. A MILITANT FREETHINKER TO WHOM I SPOKE OF THIS RAISED HIS HANDS—WITH NO EVIL INTENTION I ASSURE YOU—TO HEAVEN: “YOU’RE TELLING ME NOTHING NEW” THAT APOSTLE SIGHED “THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT.” ACCORDING TO HIM EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR WRITERS IF ONLY THEY COULD AVOID SIGNING WOULD WRITE AND HAIL THE NAME OF GOD. BUT THEY SIGN ACCORDING TO HIM BECAUSE THEY LOVE THEMSELVES AND THEY HAIL NOTHING AT ALL BECAUSE THEY LOATHE THEMSELVES. SINCE NEVERTHELESS THEY CANNOT KEEP THEMSELVES FROM JUDGING THEY MAKE UP FOR IT BY MORALIZING. IN SHORT THEIR SATANISM IS VIRTUOUS. AN ODD EPOCH INDEED! IT’S NOT AT ALL SURPRISING THAT MINDS ARE CONFUSED AND THAT ONE OF MY FRIENDS AN ATHEIST WHEN HE WAS A MODEL HUSBAND GOT CONVERTED WHEN HE BECAME AN ADULTERER!

AH THE LITTLE SNEAKS PLAY ACTORS HYPOCRITES—AND YET SO TOUCHING! BELIEVE ME THEY ALL ARE EVEN WHEN THEY SET FIRE TO HEAVEN. WHETHER THEY ARE ATHEISTS OR CHURCHGOERS MUSCOVITES OR BOSTONIANS ALL CHRISTIANS FROM FATHER TO SON. BUT IT SO HAPPENS THAT THERE IS NO MORE FATHER NO MORE RULE! THEY ARE FREE AND HENCE HAVE TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES; AND SINCE THEY DON’T WANT FREEDOM OR ITS JUDGMENTS THEY ASK TO BE RAPPED ON THE KNUCKLES THEY INVENT DREADFUL RULES THEY RUSH OUT TO BUILD PILES OF FAGGOTS TO REPLACE CHURCHES. SAVONAROLAS I TELL YOU. BUT THEY BELIEVE SOLELY IN SIN NEVER IN GRACE. THEY THINK OF IT TO BE SURE. GRACE IS WHAT THEY WANT—ACCEPTANCE SURRENDER HAPPINESS AND MAYBE FOR THEY ARE SENTIMENTAL TOO BETROTHAL THE VIRGINAL BRIDE THE UPRIGHT MAN THE ORGAN MUSIC. TAKE ME FOR EXAMPLE AND I AM NOT SENTIMENTAL—DO YOU KNOW WHAT I USED TO DREAM OF? A TOTAL LOVE OF THE WHOLE HEART AND BODY DAY AND NIGHT IN AN UNINTERRUPTED EMBRACE SENSUAL ENJOYMENT AND MENTAL EXCITEMENT—ALL LASTING FIVE YEARS AND ENDING IN DEATH. ALAS!

SO AFTER ALL FOR WANT OF BETROTHAL OR UNINTERRUPTED LOVE IT WILL BE MARRIAGE BRUTAL MARRIAGE WITH POWER AND THE WHIP. THE ESSENTIAL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BECOME SIMPLE AS FOR THE CHILD THAT EVERY ACT SHOULD BE ORDERED THAT GOOD AND EVIL SHOULD BE ARBITRARILY HENCE OBVIOUSLY POINTED OUT. AND I AGREE HOWEVER SICILIAN AND JAVANESE I MAY BE AND NOT AT ALL CHRISTIAN THOUGH I FEEL FRIENDSHIP FOR THE FIRST CHRISTIAN OF ALL. BUT ON THE BRIDGES OF PARIS I TOO LEARNED THAT I WAS AFRAID OF FREEDOM. SO HURRAY FOR THE MASTER WHOEVER HE MAY BE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF HEAVEN’S LAW. “OUR FATHER WHO ART PROVISIONALLY HERE … OUR GUIDES OUR DELIGHTFULLY SEVERE MASTERS O CRUEL AND BELOVED LEADERS …” IN SHORT YOU SEE THE ESSENTIAL IS TO CEASE BEING FREE AND TO OBEY IN REPENTANCE A GREATER ROGUE THAN ONESELF. WHEN WE ARE ALL GUILTY THAT WILL BE DEMOCRACY. WITHOUT COUNTING CHER AMI THAT WE MUST TAKE REVENGE FOR HAVING TO DIE ALONE. DEATH IS SOLITARY WHEREAS SLAVERY IS COLLECTIVE. THE OTHERS GET THEIRS TOO AND AT THE SAME TIME AS WE—THAT’S WHAT COUNTS. ALL TOGETHER AT LAST BUT ON OUR KNEES AND HEADS BOWED.

ISN’T IT GOOD LIKEWISE TO LIVE LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD AND FOR THAT DOESN’T THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE TO BE LIKE ME? THREAT DISHONOR POLICE ARE THE SACRAMENTS OF THAT RESEMBLANCE. SCORNED HUNTED DOWN COMPELLED I CAN THEN SHOW WHAT I AM WORTH ENJOY WHAT I AM BE NATURAL AT LAST. THIS IS WHY TRÈS CHER AFTER HAVING SOLEMNLY PAID MY RESPECTS TO FREEDOM I DECIDED ON THE SLY THAT IT HAD TO BE HANDED OVER WITHOUT DELAY TO ANYONE WHO COMES ALONG. AND EVERY TIME I CAN I PREACH IN MY CHURCH OF MEXICO CITY I INVITE THE GOOD PEOPLE TO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY AND HUMBLY TO SOLICIT THE COMFORTS OF SLAVERY EVEN IF I HAVE TO PRESENT IT AS TRUE FREEDOM.

BUT I’M NOT BEING CRAZY; I’M WELL AWARE THAT SLAVERY IS NOT IMMEDIATELY REALIZABLE. IT WILL BE ONE OF THE BLESSINGS OF THE FUTURE THAT’S ALL. IN THE MEANTIME I MUST GET ALONG WITH THE PRESENT AND SEEK AT LEAST A PROVISIONAL SOLUTION. HENCE I HAD TO FIND ANOTHER MEANS OF EXTENDING JUDGMENT TO EVERYBODY IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WEIGH LESS HEAVILY ON MY OWN SHOULDERS. I FOUND THE MEANS. OPEN THE WINDOW A LITTLE PLEASE; IT’S FRIGHTFULLY HOT. NOT TOO MUCH FOR I AM COLD ALSO. MY IDEA IS BOTH SIMPLE AND FERTILE. HOW TO GET EVERYONE INVOLVED IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SIT CALMLY ON THE OUTSIDE MYSELF? SHOULD I CLIMB UP TO THE PULPIT LIKE MANY OF MY ILLUSTRIOUS CONTEMPORARIES AND CURSE HUMANITY? VERY DANGEROUS THAT IS! ONE DAY OR ONE NIGHT LAUGHTER BURSTS OUT WITHOUT A WARNING. THE JUDGMENT YOU ARE PASSING ON OTHERS EVENTUALLY SNAPS BACK IN YOUR FACE CAUSING SOME DAMAGE. AND SO WHAT? YOU ASK. WELL HERE’S THE STROKE OF GENIUS. I DISCOVERED THAT WHILE WAITING FOR THE MASTERS WITH THEIR RODS WE SHOULD LIKE COPERNICUS REVERSE THE REASONING TO WIN OUT. INASMUCH AS ONE COULDN’T CONDEMN OTHERS WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY JUDGING ONESELF ONE HAD TO OVERWHELM ONESELF TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE OTHERS. INASMUCH AS EVERY JUDGE SOME DAY ENDS UP AS A PENITENT ONE HAD TO TRAVEL THE ROAD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND PRACTICE THE PROFESSION OF PENITENT TO BE ABLE TO END UP AS A JUDGE. YOU FOLLOW ME? GOOD. BUT TO MAKE MYSELF EVEN CLEARER I’LL TELL YOU HOW I OPERATE.

FIRST I CLOSED MY LAW OFFICE LEFT PARIS TRAVELED. I AIMED TO SET UP UNDER ANOTHER NAME IN SOME PLACE WHERE I SHOULDN’T LACK FOR A PRACTICE. THERE ARE MANY IN THE WORLD BUT CHANCE CONVENIENCE IRONY AND ALSO THE NECESSITY FOR A CERTAIN MORTIFICATION MADE ME CHOOSE A CAPITAL OF WATERS AND FOGS GIRDLED BY CANALS PARTICULARLY CROWDED AND VISITED BY MEN FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE EARTH. I SET UP MY OFFICE IN A BAR IN THE SAILORS’ QUARTER. THE CLIENTELE OF A PORT-TOWN IS VARIED. THE POOR DON’T GO INTO THE LUXURY DISTRICTS WHEREAS EVENTUALLY THE GENTLEFOLK ALWAYS WIND UP AT LEAST ONCE AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE DISREPUTABLE PLACES. I LIE IN WAIT PARTICULARLY FOR THE BOURGEOIS AND THE STRAYING BOURGEOIS AT THAT; IT’S WITH HIM THAT I GET MY BEST RESULTS. LIKE A VIRTUOSO WITH A RARE VIOLIN I DRAW MY SUBTLEST SOUNDS FROM HIM.

SO I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING MY USEFUL PROFESSION AT MEXICO CITY FOR SOME TIME. IT CONSISTS TO BEGIN WITH AS YOU KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IN INDULGING IN PUBLIC CONFESSION AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. I ACCUSE MYSELF UP AND DOWN. IT’S NOT HARD FOR I NOW HAVE ACQUIRED A MEMORY. BUT LET ME POINT OUT THAT I DON’T ACCUSE MYSELF CRUDELY BEATING MY BREAST. NO I NAVIGATE SKILLFULLY MULTIPLYING DISTINCTIONS AND DIGRESSIONS TOO—IN SHORT I ADAPT MY WORDS TO MY LISTENER AND LEAD HIM TO GO ME ONE BETTER. I MINGLE WHAT CONCERNS ME AND WHAT CONCERNS OTHERS. I CHOOSE THE FEATURES WE HAVE IN COMMON THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE ENDURED TOGETHER THE FAILINGS WE SHARE—GOOD FORM IN OTHER WORDS THE MAN OF THE HOUR AS HE IS RIFE IN ME AND IN OTHERS. WITH ALL THAT I CONSTRUCT A PORTRAIT WHICH IS THE IMAGE OF ALL AND OF NO ONE. A MASK IN SHORT RATHER LIKE THOSE CARNIVAL MASKS WHICH ARE BOTH LIFELIKE AND STYLIZED SO THAT THEY MAKE PEOPLE SAY: “WHY SURELY I’VE MET HIM!” WHEN THE PORTRAIT IS FINISHED AS IT IS THIS EVENING I SHOW IT WITH GREAT SORROW: “THIS ALAS IS WHAT I AM!” THE PROSECUTOR’S CHARGE IS FINISHED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE PORTRAIT I HOLD OUT TO MY CONTEMPORARIES BECOMES A MIRROR.

COVERED WITH ASHES TEARING MY HAIR MY FACE SCORED BY CLAWING BUT WITH PIERCING EYES I STAND BEFORE ALL HUMANITY RECAPITULATING MY SHAMES WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE EFFECT I AM PRODUCING AND SAYING: “I WAS THE LOWEST OF THE LOW.” THEN IMPERCEPTIBLY I PASS FROM THE “I” TO THE “WE.” WHEN I GET TO “THIS IS WHAT WE ARE” THE TRICK HAS BEEN PLAYED AND I CAN TELL THEM OFF. I AM LIKE THEM TO BE SURE; WE ARE IN THE SOUP TOGETHER. HOWEVER I HAVE A SUPERIORITY IN THAT I KNOW IT AND THIS GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO SPEAK. YOU SEE THE ADVANTAGE I AM SURE. THE MORE I ACCUSE MYSELF THE MORE I HAVE A RIGHT TO JUDGE YOU. EVEN BETTER I PROVOKE YOU INTO JUDGING YOURSELF AND THIS RELIEVES ME OF THAT MUCH OF THE BURDEN. AH MON CHER WE ARE ODD WRETCHED CREATURES AND IF WE MERELY LOOK BACK OVER OUR LIVES THERE’S NO LACK OF OCCASIONS TO AMAZE AND HORRIFY OURSELVES. JUST TRY. I SHALL LISTEN YOU MAY BE SURE TO YOUR OWN CONFESSION WITH A GREAT FEELING OF FRATERNITY.

DON’T LAUGH! YES YOU ARE A DIFFICULT CLIENT; I SAW THAT AT ONCE. BUT YOU’LL COME TO IT INEVITABLY. MOST OF THE OTHERS ARE MORE SENTIMENTAL THAN INTELLIGENT; THEY ARE DISCONCERTED AT ONCE. WITH THE INTELLIGENT ONES IT TAKES TIME. IT IS ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE METHOD FULLY TO THEM. THEY DON’T FORGET IT; THEY REFLECT. SOONER OR LATER HALF AS A GAME AND HALF OUT OF EMOTIONAL UPSET THEY GIVE UP AND TELL ALL. YOU ARE NOT ONLY INTELLIGENT YOU LOOK POLISHED BY USE. ADMIT HOWEVER THAT TODAY YOU FEEL LESS PLEASED WITH YOURSELF THAN YOU FELT FIVE DAYS AGO? NOW I SHALL WAIT FOR YOU TO WRITE ME OR COME BACK. FOR YOU WILL COME BACK I AM SURE! YOU’LL FIND ME UNCHANGED. AND WHY SHOULD I CHANGE SINCE I HAVE FOUND THE HAPPINESS THAT SUITS ME? I HAVE ACCEPTED DUPLICITY INSTEAD OF BEING UPSET ABOUT IT. ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE SETTLED INTO IT AND FOUND THERE THE COMFORT I WAS LOOKING FOR THROUGHOUT LIFE. I WAS WRONG AFTER ALL TO TELL YOU THAT THE ESSENTIAL WAS TO AVOID JUDGMENT. THE ESSENTIAL IS BEING ABLE TO PERMIT ONESELF EVERYTHING EVEN IF FROM TIME TO TIME ONE HAS TO PROFESS VOCIFEROUSLY ONE’S OWN INFAMY. I PERMIT MYSELF EVERYTHING AGAIN AND WITHOUT THE LAUGHTER THIS TIME. I HAVEN’T CHANGED MY WAY OF LIFE; I CONTINUE TO LOVE MYSELF AND TO MAKE USE OF OTHERS. ONLY THE CONFESSION OF MY CRIMES ALLOWS ME TO BEGIN AGAIN LIGHTER IN HEART AND TO TASTE A DOUBLE ENJOYMENT FIRST OF MY NATURE AND SECONDLY OF A CHARMING REPENTANCE.

SINCE FINDING MY SOLUTION I YIELD TO EVERYTHING TO WOMEN TO PRIDE TO BOREDOM TO RESENTMENT AND EVEN TO THE FEVER THAT I FEEL DELIGHTFULLY RISING AT THIS MOMENT. I DOMINATE AT LAST BUT FOREVER. ONCE MORE I HAVE FOUND A HEIGHT TO WHICH I AM THE ONLY ONE TO CLIMB AND FROM WHICH I CAN JUDGE EVERYBODY. AT LONG INTERVALS ON A REALLY BEAUTIFUL NIGHT I OCCASIONALLY HEAR A DISTANT LAUGH AND AGAIN I DOUBT. BUT QUICKLY I CRUSH EVERYTHING PEOPLE AND THINGS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MY OWN INFIRMITY AND AT ONCE I PERK UP.

SO I SHALL AWAIT YOUR RESPECTS AT MEXICO CITY AS LONG AS NECESSARY. BUT REMOVE THIS BLANKET; I WANT TO BREATHE. YOU WILL COME WON’T YOU? I’LL SHOW YOU THE DETAILS OF MY TECHNIQUE FOR I FEEL A SORT OF AFFECTION FOR YOU. YOU WILL SEE ME TEACHING THEM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THAT THEY ARE VILE. THIS VERY EVENING MOREOVER I SHALL RESUME. I CAN’T DO WITHOUT IT OR DENY MYSELF THOSE MOMENTS WHEN ONE OF THEM COLLAPSES WITH THE HELP OF ALCOHOL AND BEATS HIS BREAST. THEN I GROW TALLER TRÈS CHER I GROW TALLER I BREATHE FREELY I AM ON THE MOUNTAIN THE PLAIN STRETCHES BEFORE MY EYES. HOW INTOXICATING TO FEEL LIKE GOD THE FATHER AND TO HAND OUT DEFINITIVE TESTIMONIALS OF BAD CHARACTER AND HABITS. I SIT ENTHRONED AMONG MY BAD ANGELS AT THE SUMMIT OF THE DUTCH HEAVEN AND I WATCH ASCENDING TOWARD ME AS THEY ISSUE FROM THE FOGS AND THE WATER THE MULTITUDE OF THE LAST JUDGMENT. THEY RISE SLOWLY; I ALREADY SEE THE FIRST OF THEM ARRIVING. ON HIS BEWILDERED FACE HALF HIDDEN BY HIS HAND I READ THE MELANCHOLY OF THE COMMON CONDITION AND THE DESPAIR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE IT. AND AS FOR ME I PITY WITHOUT ABSOLVING I UNDERSTAND WITHOUT FORGIVING AND ABOVE ALL I FEEL AT LAST THAT I AM BEING ADORED!

YES I AM MOVING ABOUT. HOW COULD I REMAIN IN BED LIKE A GOOD PATIENT? I MUST BE HIGHER THAN YOU AND MY THOUGHTS LIFT ME UP. SUCH NIGHTS OR SUCH MORNINGS RATHER (FOR THE FALL OCCURS AT DAWN) I GO OUT AND WALK BRISKLY ALONG THE CANALS. IN THE LIVID SKY THE LAYERS OF FEATHERS BECOME THINNER THE DOVES MOVE A LITTLE HIGHER AND ABOVE THE ROOFS A ROSY LIGHT ANNOUNCES A NEW DAY OF MY CREATION. ON THE DAMRAK THE FIRST STREETCAR SOUNDS ITS BELL IN THE DAMP AIR AND MARKS THE AWAKENING OF LIFE AT THE EXTREMITY OF THIS EUROPE WHERE AT THE SAME MOMENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEN MY SUBJECTS PAINFULLY SLIP OUT OF BED A BITTER TASTE IN THEIR MOUTHS TO GO TO A JOYLESS WORK. THEN SOARING OVER THIS WHOLE CONTINENT WHICH IS UNDER MY SWAY WITHOUT KNOWING IT DRINKING IN THE ABSINTHE-COLORED LIGHT OF BREAKING DAY INTOXICATED WITH EVIL WORDS I AM HAPPY—I AM HAPPY I TELL YOU I WON’T LET YOU THINK I’M NOT HAPPY I AM HAPPY UNTO DEATH! OH SUN BEACHES AND THE ISLANDS IN THE PATH OF THE TRADE WINDS YOUTH WHOSE MEMORY DRIVES ONE TO DESPAIR!

I’M GOING BACK TO BED; FORGIVE ME. I FEAR I GOT WORKED UP; YET I’M NOT WEEPING. AT TIMES ONE WANDERS DOUBTING THE FACTS EVEN WHEN ONE HAS DISCOVERED THE SECRETS OF THE GOOD LIFE. TO BE SURE MY SOLUTION IS NOT THE IDEAL. BUT WHEN YOU DON’T LIKE YOUR OWN LIFE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST CHANGE LIVES YOU DON’T HAVE ANY CHOICE DO YOU? WHAT CAN ONE DO TO BECOME ANOTHER? IMPOSSIBLE. ONE WOULD HAVE TO CEASE BEING ANYONE FORGET ONESELF FOR SOMEONE ELSE AT LEAST ONCE. BUT HOW? DON’T BEAR DOWN TOO HARD ON ME. I’M LIKE THAT OLD BEGGAR WHO WOULDN’T LET GO OF MY HAND ONE DAY ON A CAFÉ TERRACE: “OH SIR” HE SAID “IT’S NOT JUST THAT I’M NO GOOD BUT YOU LOSE TRACK OF THE LIGHT.” YES WE HAVE LOST TRACK OF THE LIGHT THE MORNINGS THE HOLY INNOCENCE OF THOSE WHO FORGIVE THEMSELVES.

LOOK IT’S SNOWING! OH I MUST GO OUT! AMSTERDAM ASLEEP IN THE WHITE NIGHT THE DARK JADE CANALS UNDER THE LITTLE SNOW-COVERED BRIDGES THE EMPTY STREETS MY MUFFLED STEPS—THERE WILL BE PURITY EVEN IF FLEETING BEFORE TOMORROW’S MUD. SEE THE HUGE FLAKES DRIFTING AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES. IT MUST BE THE DOVES SURELY. THEY FINALLY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO COME DOWN THE LITTLE DEARS; THEY ARE COVERING THE WATERS AND THE ROOFS WITH A THICK LAYER OF FEATHERS; THEY ARE FLUTTERING AT EVERY WINDOW. WHAT AN INVASION! LET’S HOPE THEY ARE BRINGING GOOD NEWS. EVERYONE WILL BE SAVED EH?—AND NOT ONLY THE ELECT. POSSESSIONS AND HARDSHIPS WILL BE SHARED AND YOU FOR EXAMPLE FROM TODAY ON YOU WILL SLEEP EVERY NIGHT ON THE GROUND FOR ME. THE WHOLE SHOOTING MATCH EH? COME NOW ADMIT THAT YOU WOULD BE FLABBERGASTED IF A CHARIOT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN TO CARRY ME OFF OR IF THE SNOW SUDDENLY CAUGHT FIRE. YOU DON’T BELIEVE IT? NOR DO I. BUT STILL I MUST GO OUT.

ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT I’LL BE QUIET; DON’T GET UPSET! DON’T TAKE MY EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS OR MY RAVINGS TOO SERIOUSLY. THEY ARE CONTROLLED. SAY NOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT YOURSELF I SHALL FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF MY ABSORBING CONFESSION IS ACHIEVED. I ALWAYS HOPE IN FACT THAT MY INTERLOCUTOR WILL BE A POLICEMAN AND THAT HE WILL ARREST ME FOR THE THEFT OF “THE JUST JUDGES.” FOR THE REST—AM I RIGHT?—NO ONE CAN ARREST ME. BUT AS FOR THAT THEFT IT FALLS WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW AND I HAVE ARRANGED EVERYTHING SO AS TO MAKE MYSELF AN ACCOMPLICE: I AM HARBORING THAT PAINTING AND SHOWING IT TO WHOEVER WANTS TO SEE IT. YOU WOULD ARREST ME THEN; THAT WOULD BE A GOOD BEGINNING. PERHAPS THE REST WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF SUBSEQUENTLY; I WOULD BE DECAPITATED FOR INSTANCE AND I’D HAVE NO MORE FEAR OF DEATH; I’D BE SAVED. ABOVE THE GATHERED CROWD YOU WOULD HOLD UP MY STILL WARM HEAD SO THAT THEY COULD RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES IN IT AND I COULD AGAIN DOMINATE—AN EXEMPLAR. ALL WOULD BE CONSUMMATED; I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT TO A CLOSE UNSEEN AND UNKNOWN MY CAREER AS A FALSE PROPHET CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS AND REFUSING TO COME FORTH.

BUT OF COURSE YOU ARE NOT A POLICEMAN; THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY. WHAT? AH I SUSPECTED AS MUCH YOU SEE. THAT STRANGE AFFECTION I FELT FOR YOU HAD SENSE TO IT THEN. IN PARIS YOU PRACTICE THE NOBLE PROFESSION OF LAWYER! I SENSED THAT WE WERE OF THE SAME SPECIES. ARE WE NOT ALL ALIKE CONSTANTLY TALKING AND TO NO ONE FOREVER UP AGAINST THE SAME QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THE ANSWERS IN ADVANCE? THEN PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ONE NIGHT ON THE QUAYS OF THE SEINE AND HOW YOU MANAGED NEVER TO RISK YOUR LIFE. YOU YOURSELF UTTER THE WORDS THAT FOR YEARS HAVE NEVER CEASED ECHOING THROUGH MY NIGHTS AND THAT I SHALL AT LAST SAY THROUGH YOUR MOUTH: “O YOUNG WOMAN THROW YOURSELF INTO THE WATER AGAIN SO THAT I MAY A SECOND TIME HAVE THE CHANCE OF SAVING BOTH OF US!” A SECOND TIME EH WHAT A RISKY SUGGESTION! JUST SUPPOSE CHER MAÎTRE THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKEN LITERALLY? WE’D HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. BRR …! THE WATER’S SO COLD! BUT LET’S NOT WORRY! IT’S TOO LATE NOW. IT WILL ALWAYS BE TOO LATE. FORTUNATELY!

STREET HAUNTING: A LONDON ADVENTURE
NO ONE PERHAPS HAS EVER FELT PASSIONATELY TOWARDS A LEAD PENCIL. BUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT CAN BECOME SUPREMELY DESIRABLE TO POSSESS ONE; MOMENTS WHEN WE ARE SET UPON HAVING AN OBJECT AN EXCUSE FOR WALKING HALF ACROSS LONDON BETWEEN TEA AND DINNER. AS THE FOXHUNTER HUNTS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE BREED OF HORSES AND THE GOLFER PLAYS IN ORDER THAT OPEN SPACES MAY BE PRESERVED FROM THE BUILDERS SO WHEN THE DESIRE COMES UPON US TO GO STREET RAMBLING THE PENCIL DOES FOR A PRETEXT AND GETTING UP WE SAY ‘REALLY I MUST BUY A PENCIL’ AS IF UNDER COVER OF THIS EXCUSE WE COULD INDULGE SAFELY IN THE GREATEST PLEASURE OF TOWN LIFE IN WINTER—RAMBLING THE STREETS OF LONDON.

THE HOUR SHOULD BE THE EVENING AND THE SEASON WINTER FOR IN WINTER THE CHAMPAGNE BRIGHTNESS OF THE AIR AND THE SOCIABILITY OF THE STREETS ARE GRATEFUL. WE ARE NOT THEN TAUNTED AS IN THE SUMMER BY THE LONGING FOR SHADE AND SOLITUDE AND SWEET AIRS FROM THE HAYFIELDS. THE EVENING HOUR TOO GIVES US THE IRRESPONSIBILITY WHICH DARKNESS AND LAMPLIGHT BESTOW. WE ARE NO LONGER QUITE OURSELVES. AS WE STEP OUT OF THE HOUSE ON A FINE EVENING BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX WE SHED THE SELF OUR FRIENDS KNOW US BY AND BECOME PART OF THAT VAST REPUBLICAN ARMY OF ANONYMOUS TRAMPERS WHOSE SOCIETY IS SO AGREEABLE AFTER THE SOLITUDE OF ONE’S OWN ROOM. FOR THERE WE SIT SURROUNDED BY OBJECTS WHICH PERPETUALLY EXPRESS THE ODDITY OF OUR OWN TEMPERAMENTS AND ENFORCE THE MEMORIES OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. THAT BOWL ON THE MANTELPIECE FOR INSTANCE WAS BOUGHT AT MANTUA* ON A WINDY DAY. WE WERE LEAVING THE SHOP WHEN THE SINISTER OLD WOMAN PLUCKED AT OUR SKIRTS AND SAID SHE WOULD FIND HERSELF STARVING ONE OF THESE DAYS BUT ‘TAKE IT!’ SHE CRIED AND THRUST THE BLUE AND WHITE CHINA BOWL INTO OUR HANDS AS IF SHE NEVER WANTED TO BE REMINDED OF HER QUIXOTIC GENEROSITY. SO GUILTILY BUT SUSPECTING NEVERTHELESS HOW BADLY WE HAD BEEN FLEECED WE CARRIED IT BACK TO THE LITTLE HOTEL WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE INNKEEPER QUARRELLED SO VIOLENTLY WITH HIS WIFE THAT WE ALL LEANT OUT INTO THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AND SAW THE VINES LACED ABOUT AMONG THE PILLARS AND THE STARS WHITE IN THE SKY. THE MOMENT WAS STABILIZED STAMPED LIKE A COIN INDELIBLY AMONG A MILLION THAT SLIPPED BY IMPERCEPTIBLY. THERE TOO WAS THE MELANCHOLY ENGLISHMAN WHO ROSE AMONG THE COFFEE CUPS AND THE LITTLE IRON TABLES AND REVEALED THE SECRETS OF HIS SOUL—AS TRAVELLERS DO. ALL THIS—ITALY THE WINDY MORNING THE VINES LACED ABOUT THE PILLARS THE ENGLISHMAN AND THE SECRETS OF HIS SOUL—RISE UP IN A CLOUD FROM THE CHINA BOWL ON THE MANTELPIECE. AND THERE AS OUR EYES FALL TO THE FLOOR IS THAT BROWN STAMP ON THE CARPET. MR LLOYD GEORGE MADE THAT. ‘THE MAN’S A DEVIL!’ SAID MR CUMMINGS* PUTTING THE KETTLE DOWN WITH WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO FILL THE TEAPOT SO THAT IT BURNT A BROWN RING ON THE CARPET.

BUT WHEN THE DOOR SHUTS ON US ALL THAT VANISHES. THE SHELL-LIKE COVERING WHICH OUR SOULS HAVE EXCRETED TO HOUSE THEMSELVES TO MAKE FOR THEMSELVES A SHAPE DISTINCT FROM OTHERS IS BROKEN AND THERE IS LEFT OF ALL THESE WRINKLES AND ROUGHNESSES A CENTRAL OYSTER OF PERCEPTIVENESS AN ENORMOUS EYE. HOW BEAUTIFUL A STREET IS IN WINTER! IT IS AT ONCE REVEALED AND OBSCURED. HERE VAGUELY ONE CAN TRACE SYMMETRICAL STRAIGHT AVENUES OF DOORS AND WINDOWS; HERE UNDER THE LAMPS ARE FLOATING ISLANDS OF PALE LIGHT THROUGH WHICH PASS QUICKLY BRIGHT MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOR ALL THEIR POVERTY AND SHABBINESS WEAR A CERTAIN LOOK OF UNREALITY AN AIR OF TRIUMPH AS IF THEY HAD GIVEN LIFE THE SLIP SO THAT LIFE DECEIVED OF HER PREY BLUNDERS ON WITHOUT THEM. BUT AFTER ALL WE ARE ONLY GLIDING SMOOTHLY ON THE SURFACE. THE EYE IS NOT A MINER NOT A DIVER NOT A SEEKER AFTER BURIED TREASURE. IT FLOATS US SMOOTHLY DOWN A STREAM RESTING PAUSING THE BRAIN SLEEPS PERHAPS AS IT LOOKS.

HOW BEAUTIFUL A LONDON STREET IS THEN WITH ITS ISLANDS OF LIGHT AND ITS LONG GROVES OF DARKNESS AND ON ONE SIDE OF IT PERHAPS SOME TREESPRINKLED GRASS-GROWN SPACE WHERE NIGHT IS FOLDING HERSELF TO SLEEP NATURALLY AND AS ONE PASSES THE IRON RAILING ONE HEARS THOSE LITTLE CRACKLINGS AND STIRRINGS OF LEAF AND TWIG WHICH SEEM TO SUPPOSE THE SILENCE OF FIELDS ALL ROUND THEM AN OWL HOOTING AND FAR AWAY THE RATTLE OF A TRAIN IN THE VALLEY. BUT THIS IS LONDON WE ARE REMINDED; HIGH AMONG THE BARE TREES ARE HUNG OBLONG FRAMES OF REDDISH YELLOW LIGHT—WINDOWS; THERE ARE POINTS OF BRILLIANCE BURNING STEADILY LIKE LOW STARS—LAMPS; THIS EMPTY GROUND WHICH HOLDS THE COUNTRY IN IT AND ITS PEACE IS ONLY A LONDON SQUARE SET ABOUT BY OFFICES AND HOUSES WHERE AT THIS HOUR FIERCE LIGHTS BURN OVER MAPS OVER DOCUMENTS OVER DESKS WHERE CLERKS SIT TURNING WITH WETTED FOREFINGERS THE FILES OF ENDLESS CORRESPONDENCES; OR MORE SUFFUSEDLY THE FIRELIGHT WAVERS AND THE LAMPLIGHT FALLS UPON THE PRIVACY OF SOME DRAWING-ROOM ITS EASY CHAIRS ITS PAPERS ITS CHINA ITS INLAID TABLE AND THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN ACCURATELY MEASURING OUT THE PRECISE NUMBER OF SPOONS OF TEA WHICH——SHE LOOKS AT THE DOOR AS IF SHE HEARD A RING DOWNSTAIRS AND SOMEBODY ASKING IS SHE IN?

BUT HERE WE MUST STOP PEREMPTORILY. WE ARE IN DANGER OF DIGGING DEEPER THAN THE EYE APPROVES; WE ARE IMPEDING OUR PASSAGE DOWN THE SMOOTH STREAM BY CATCHING AT SOME BRANCH OR ROOT. AT ANY MOMENT THE SLEEPING ARMY MAY STIR ITSELF AND WAKE IN US A THOUSAND VIOLINS AND TRUMPETS IN RESPONSE; THE ARMY OF HUMAN BEINGS MAY ROUSE ITSELF AND ASSERT ALL ITS ODDITIES AND SUFFERINGS AND SORDIDITIES. LET US DALLY A LITTLE LONGER BE CONTENT STILL WITH SURFACES ONLY—THE GLOSSY BRILLIANCE OF THE MOTOR OMNIBUSES; THE CARNAL SPLENDOUR OF THE BUTCHERS’ SHOPS WITH THEIR YELLOW FLANKS AND PURPLE STEAKS; THE BLUE AND RED BUNCHES OF FLOWERS BURNING SO BRAVELY THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS OF THE FLORISTS’ WINDOWS.

FOR THE EYE HAS THIS STRANGE PROPERTY: IT RESTS ONLY ON BEAUTY; LIKE A BUTTERFLY IT SEEKS OUT COLOUR AND BASKS IN WARMTH. ON A WINTER’S NIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN NATURE HAS BEEN AT PAINS TO POLISH AND PREEN HERSELF IT BRINGS BACK THE PRETTIEST TROPHIES BREAKS OFF LITTLE LUMPS OF EMERALD AND CORAL AS IF THE WHOLE EARTH WERE MADE OF PRECIOUS STONE. THE THING IT CANNOT DO (ONE IS SPEAKING OF THE AVERAGE UNPROFESSIONAL EYE) IS TO COMPOSE THESE TROPHIES IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BRING OUT THEIR MORE OBSCURE ANGLES AND RELATIONSHIPS. HENCE AFTER A PROLONGED DIET OF THIS SIMPLE SUGARY FARE OF BEAUTY PURE AND UNCOMPOSED WE BECOME CONSCIOUS OF SATIETY. WE HALT AT THE DOOR OF THE BOOT SHOP AND MAKE SOME LITTLE EXCUSE WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL REASON FOR FOLDING UP THE BRIGHT PARAPHERNALIA OF THE STREETS AND WITHDRAWING TO SOME DUSKIER CHAMBER OF THE BEING WHERE WE MAY ASK AS WE RAISE OUR LEFT FOOT OBEDIENTLY UPON THE STAND ‘WHAT THEN IS IT LIKE TO BE A DWARF?’

SHE CAME IN ESCORTED BY TWO WOMEN WHO BEING OF NORMAL SIZE LOOKED LIKE BENEVOLENT GIANTS BESIDE HER. SMILING AT THE SHOP GIRLS THEY SEEMED TO BE AT ONCE DISCLAIMING ANY LOT IN HER DEFORMITY AND ASSURING HER OF THEIR PROTECTION. SHE WORE THE PEEVISH YET APOLOGETIC EXPRESSION USUAL ON THE FACES OF THE DEFORMED. SHE NEEDED THEIR KINDNESS YET SHE RESENTED IT. BUT WHEN THE SHOP GIRL HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND THE GIANTESSES SMILING INDULGENTLY HAD ASKED FOR SHOES FOR ‘THIS LADY’ AND THE GIRL HAD PUSHED THE LITTLE STAND IN FRONT OF HER THE DWARF STUCK HER FOOT OUT WITH AN IMPETUOSITY WHICH SEEMED TO CLAIM ALL OUR ATTENTION. LOOK AT THAT! LOOK AT THAT! SHE SEEMED TO DEMAND OF US ALL AS SHE THRUST HER FOOT OUT FOR BEHOLD IT WAS THE SHAPELY PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED FOOT OF A WELL-GROWN WOMAN. IT WAS ARCHED; IT WAS ARISTOCRATIC. HER WHOLE MANNER CHANGED AS SHE LOOKED AT IT RESTING ON THE STAND. SHE LOOKED SOOTHED AND SATISFIED. HER MANNER BECAME FULL OF SELF-CONFIDENCE. SHE SENT FOR SHOE AFTER SHOE; SHE TRIED ON PAIR AFTER PAIR. SHE GOT UP AND PIROUETTED BEFORE A GLASS WHICH REFLECTED THE FOOT ONLY IN YELLOW SHOES IN FAWN SHOES IN SHOES OF LIZARD SKIN. SHE RAISED HER LITTLE SKIRTS AND DISPLAYED HER LITTLE LEGS. SHE WAS THINKING THAT AFTER ALL FEET ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE WHOLE PERSON; WOMEN SHE SAID TO HERSELF HAVE BEEN LOVED FOR THEIR FEET ALONE. SEEING NOTHING BUT HER FEET SHE IMAGINED PERHAPS THAT THE REST OF HER BODY WAS OF A PIECE WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL FEET. SHE WAS SHABBILY DRESSED BUT SHE WAS READY TO LAVISH ANY MONEY UPON HER SHOES. AND AS THIS WAS THE ONLY OCCASION UPON WHICH SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF BEING LOOKED AT BUT POSITIVELY CRAVED ATTENTION SHE WAS READY TO USE ANY DEVICE TO PROLONG THE CHOOSING AND FITTING. LOOK AT MY FEET LOOK AT MY FEET SHE SEEMED TO BE SAYING AS SHE TOOK A STEP THIS WAY AND THEN A STEP THAT WAY. THE SHOP GIRL GOOD-HUMOUREDLY MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING FLATTERING FOR SUDDENLY HER FACE LIT UP IN AN ECSTASY. BUT AFTER ALL THE GIANTESSES BENEVOLENT THOUGH THEY WERE HAD THEIR OWN AFFAIRS TO SEE TO; SHE MUST MAKE UP HER MIND; SHE MUST DECIDE WHICH TO CHOOSE. AT LENGTH THE PAIR WAS CHOSEN AND AS SHE WALKED OUT BETWEEN HER GUARDIANS WITH THE PARCEL SWINGING FROM HER FINGER THE ECSTASY FADED KNOWLEDGE RETURNED THE OLD PEEVISHNESS THE OLD APOLOGY CAME BACK AND BY THE TIME SHE HAD REACHED THE STREET AGAIN SHE HAD BECOME A DWARF.

BUT SHE HAD CHANGED THE MOOD; SHE HAD CALLED INTO BEING AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH AS WE FOLLOWED HER OUT INTO THE STREET SEEMED ACTUALLY TO CREATE THE HUMPED THE TWISTED THE DEFORMED. TWO BEARDED MEN BROTHERS APPARENTLY STONE-BLIND SUPPORTING THEMSELVES BY RESTING A HAND ON THE HEAD OF A SMALL BOY BETWEEN THEM MARCHED DOWN THE STREET. ON THEY CAME WITH THE UNYIELDING YET TREMULOUS TREAD OF THE BLIND WHICH SEEMS TO LEND TO THEIR APPROACH SOMETHING OF THE TERROR AND INEVITABILITY OF THE FATE THAT HAS OVERTAKEN THEM. AS THEY PASSED HOLDING STRAIGHT ON THE LITTLE CONVOY SEEMED TO CLEAVE ASUNDER THE PASSERS-BY WITH THE MOMENTUM OF ITS SILENCE ITS DIRECTNESS ITS DISASTER. INDEED THE DWARF HAD STARTED A HOBBLING GROTESQUE DANCE TO WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE STREET NOW CONFORMED: THE STOUT LADY TIGHTLY SWATHED IN SHINY SEALSKIN; THE FEEBLE-MINDED BOY SUCKING THE SILVER KNOB OF HIS STICK; THE OLD MAN SQUATTED ON A DOORSTEP AS IF SUDDENLY OVERCOME BY THE ABSURDITY OF THE HUMAN SPECTACLE HE HAD SAT DOWN TO LOOK AT IT—ALL JOINED IN THE HOBBLE AND TAP OF THE DWARF’S DANCE.

IN WHAT CREVICES AND CRANNIES ONE MIGHT ASK DID THEY LODGE THIS MAIMED COMPANY OF THE HALT AND THE BLIND? HERE PERHAPS IN THE TOP ROOMS OF THESE NARROW OLD HOUSES BETWEEN HOLBORN AND THE STRAND WHERE PEOPLE HAVE SUCH QUEER NAMES AND PURSUE SO MANY CURIOUS TRADES ARE GOLD BEATERS ACCORDION PLEATERS COVER BUTTONS OR OTHERS WHO SUPPORT LIFE WITH EVEN GREATER FANTASTICALITY UPON A TRAFFIC IN CUPS WITHOUT SAUCERS CHINA UMBRELLA HANDLES AND HIGHLY COLOURED PICTURES OF MARTYRED SAINTS. THERE THEY LODGE AND IT SEEMS AS IF THE LADY IN THE SEALSKIN JACKET MUST FIND LIFE TOLERABLE PASSING THE TIME OF DAY WITH THE ACCORDION PLEATER OR THE MAN WHO COVERS BUTTONS; LIFE WHICH IS SO FANTASTIC CANNOT BE ALTOGETHER TRAGIC. THEY DO NOT GRUDGE US WE ARE MUSING OUR PROSPERITY; WHEN SUDDENLY TURNING THE CORNER WE COME UPON A BEARDED JEW WILD HUNGER-BITTEN GLARING OUT OF HIS MISERY; OR PASS THE HUMPED BODY OF AN OLD WOMAN FLUNG ABANDONED ON THE STEP OF A PUBLIC BUILDING WITH A CLOAK OVER HER LIKE THE HASTY COVERING THROWN OVER A DEAD HORSE OR DONKEY. AT SUCH SIGHTS THE NERVES OF THE SPINE SEEM TO STAND ERECT; A SUDDEN FLARE IS BRANDISHED IN OUR EYES; A QUESTION IS ASKED WHICH IS NEVER ANSWERED. OFTEN ENOUGH THESE DERELICTS CHOOSE TO LIE NOT A STONE’S THROW FROM THEATRES WITHIN HEARING OF BARREL ORGANS ALMOST AS NIGHT DRAWS ON WITHIN TOUCH OF THE SEQUINED CLOAKS AND BRIGHT LEGS OF DINERS AND DANCERS. THEY LIE CLOSE TO THOSE SHOP WINDOWS WHERE COMMERCE OFFERS TO A WORLD OF OLD WOMEN LAID ON DOORSTEPS OF BLIND MEN OF HOBBLING DWARFS SOFAS WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GILT NECKS OF PROUD SWANS; TABLES INLAID WITH BASKETS OF MANY COLOURED FRUIT; SIDEBOARDS PAVED WITH GREEN MARBLE THE BETTER TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF BOARS’ HEADS GILT BASKETS CANDELABRA; AND CARPETS SO SOFTENED WITH AGE THAT THEIR CARNATIONS HAVE ALMOST VANISHED IN A PALE GREEN SEA.

PASSING GLIMPSING EVERYTHING SEEMS ACCIDENTALLY BUT MIRACULOUSLY SPRINKLED WITH BEAUTY AS IF THE TIDE OF TRADE WHICH DEPOSITS ITS BURDEN SO PUNCTUALLY AND PROSAICALLY UPON THE SHORES OF OXFORD STREET HAD THIS NIGHT CAST UP NOTHING BUT TREASURE. WITH NO THOUGHT OF BUYING THE EYE IS SPORTIVE AND GENEROUS; IT CREATES; IT ADORNS; IT ENHANCES. STANDING OUT IN THE STREET ONE MAY BUILD UP ALL THE CHAMBERS OF A VAST IMAGINARY HOUSE AND FURNISH THEM AT ONE’S WILL WITH SOFA TABLE CARPET. THAT RUG WILL DO FOR THE HALL. THAT ALABASTER BOWL SHALL STAND ON A CARVED TABLE IN THE WINDOW. OUR MERRYMAKINGS SHALL BE REFLECTED IN THAT THICK ROUND MIRROR. BUT HAVING BUILT AND FURNISHED THE HOUSE ONE IS HAPPILY UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO POSSESS IT; ONE CAN DISMANTLE IT IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE BUILD AND FURNISH ANOTHER HOUSE WITH OTHER CHAIRS AND OTHER GLASSES. OR LET US INDULGE OURSELVES AT THE ANTIQUE JEWELLERS AMONG THE TRAYS OF RINGS AND THE HANGING NECKLACES. LET US CHOOSE THOSE PEARLS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN IMAGINE HOW IF WE PUT THEM ON LIFE WOULD BE CHANGED. IT BECOMES INSTANTLY BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING; THE LAMPS ARE BURNING VERY WHITE IN THE DESERTED STREETS OF MAYFAIR. ONLY MOTOR CARS ARE ABROAD AT THIS HOUR AND ONE HAS A SENSE OF EMPTINESS OF AIRINESS OF SECLUDED GAIETY. WEARING PEARLS WEARING SILK ONE STEPS OUT ON TO A BALCONY WHICH OVERLOOKS THE GARDENS OF SLEEPING MAYFAIR. THERE ARE A FEW LIGHTS IN THE BEDROOMS OF GREAT PEERS RETURNED FROM COURT OF SILK-STOCKINGED FOOTMEN OF DOWAGERS WHO HAVE PRESSED THE HANDS OF STATESMEN. A CAT CREEPS ALONG THE GARDEN WALL. LOVE-MAKING IS GOING ON SIBILANTLY SEDUCTIVELY IN THE DARKER PLACES OF THE ROOM BEHIND THICK GREEN CURTAINS. STROLLING SEDATELY AS IF HE WERE PROMENADING A TERRACE BENEATH WHICH THE SHIRES AND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND LIE SUN-BATHED THE AGED PRIME MINISTER* RECOUNTS TO LADY SO-AND-SO WITH THE CURLS AND THE EMERALDS THE TRUE HISTORY OF SOME GREAT CRISIS IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE LAND. WE SEEM TO BE RIDING ON THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST MAST OF THE TALLEST SHIP; AND YET AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT NOTHING OF THIS SORT MATTERS; LOVE IS NOT PROVED THUS NOR GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED THUS; SO THAT WE SPORT WITH THE MOMENT AND PREEN OUR FEATHERS IN IT LIGHTLY AS WE STAND ON THE BALCONY WATCHING THE MOONLIT CAT CREEP ALONG PRINCESS MARY’S GARDEN WALL.

BUT WHAT COULD BE MORE ABSURD? IT IS IN FACT ON THE STROKE OF SIX; IT IS A WINTER’S EVENING; WE ARE WALKING TO THE STRAND TO BUY A PENCIL. HOW THEN ARE WE ALSO ON A BALCONY WEARING PEARLS IN JUNE? WHAT COULD BE MORE ABSURD? YET IT IS NATURE’S FOLLY NOT OURS. WHEN SHE SET ABOUT HER CHIEF MASTERPIECE THE MAKING OF MAN SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ONE THING ONLY. INSTEAD TURNING HER HEAD LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER INTO EACH ONE OF US SHE LET CREEP INSTINCTS AND DESIRES WHICH ARE UTTERLY AT VARIANCE WITH HIS MAIN BEING SO THAT WE ARE STREAKED VARIEGATED ALL OF A MIXTURE; THE COLOURS HAVE RUN. IS THE TRUE SELF THIS WHICH STANDS ON THE PAVEMENT IN JANUARY OR THAT WHICH BENDS OVER THE BALCONY IN JUNE? AM I HERE OR AM I THERE? OR IS THE TRUE SELF NEITHER THIS NOR THAT NEITHER HERE NOR THERE BUT SOMETHING SO VARIED AND WANDERING THAT IT IS ONLY WHEN WE GIVE THE REIN TO ITS WISHES AND LET IT TAKE ITS WAY UNIMPEDED THAT WE ARE INDEED OURSELVES? CIRCUMSTANCES COMPEL UNITY; FOR CONVENIENCE’ SAKE A MAN MUST BE A WHOLE. THE GOOD CITIZEN WHEN HE OPENS HIS DOOR IN THE EVENING MUST BE BANKER GOLFER HUSBAND FATHER; NOT A NOMAD WANDERING THE DESERT A MYSTIC STARING AT THE SKY A DEBAUCHEE IN THE SLUMS OF SAN FRANCISCO A SOLDIER HEADING A REVOLUTION A PARIAH HOWLING WITH SCEPTICISM AND SOLITUDE. WHEN HE OPENS HIS DOOR HE MUST RUN HIS FINGERS THROUGH HIS HAIR AND PUT HIS UMBRELLA IN THE STAND LIKE THE REST.

BUT HERE NONE TOO SOON ARE THE SECOND-HAND BOOKSHOPS. HERE WE FIND ANCHORAGE IN THESE THWARTING CURRENTS OF BEING; HERE WE BALANCE OURSELVES AFTER THE SPLENDOURS AND MISERIES OF THE STREETS. THE VERY SIGHT OF THE BOOKSELLER’S WIFE WITH HER FOOT ON THE FENDER SITTING BESIDE A GOOD COAL FIRE SCREENED FROM THE DOOR IS SOBERING AND CHEERFUL. SHE IS NEVER READING OR HAS ONLY THE NEWSPAPER; HER TALK WHEN IT LEAVES BOOKSELLING AS IT DOES SO GLADLY IS ABOUT HATS; SHE LIKES A HAT TO BE PRACTICAL SHE SAYS AS WELL AS PRETTY. OH NO THEY DON’T LIVE AT THE SHOP; THEY LIVE AT BRIXTON; SHE MUST HAVE A BIT OF GREEN TO LOOK AT. IN SUMMER A JAR OF FLOWERS GROWN IN HER OWN GARDEN IS STOOD ON THE TOP OF SOME DUSTY PILE TO ENLIVEN THE SHOP. BOOKS ARE EVERYWHERE; AND ALWAYS THE SAME SENSE OF ADVENTURE FILLS US. SECOND-HAND BOOKS ARE WILD BOOKS HOMELESS BOOKS; THEY HAVE COME TOGETHER IN VAST FLOCKS OF VARIEGATED FEATHER AND HAVE A CHARM WHICH THE DOMESTICATED VOLUMES OF THE LIBRARY LACK. BESIDES IN THIS RANDOM MISCELLANEOUS COMPANY WE MAY RUB AGAINST SOME COMPLETE STRANGER WHO WILL WITH LUCK TURN INTO THE BEST FRIEND WE HAVE IN THE WORLD. THERE IS ALWAYS A HOPE AS WE REACH DOWN SOME GRAYISH-WHITE BOOK FROM AN UPPER SHELF DIRECTED BY ITS AIR OF SHABBINESS AND DESERTION OF MEETING HERE WITH A MAN WHO SET OUT ON HORSEBACK OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO TO EXPLORE THE WOOLLEN MARKET IN THE MIDLANDS AND WALES; AN UNKNOWN TRAVELLER WHO STAYED AT INNS DRANK HIS PINT NOTED PRETTY GIRLS AND SERIOUS CUSTOMS WROTE IT ALL DOWN STIFFLY LABORIOUSLY FOR SHEER LOVE OF IT (THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED AT HIS OWN EXPENSE); WAS INFINITELY PROSY BUSY AND MATTER-OF-FACT AND SO LET FLOW IN WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT THE VERY SCENT OF HOLLYHOCKS AND THE HAY TOGETHER WITH SUCH A PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AS GIVES HIM FOREVER A SEAT IN THE WARM CORNER OF THE MIND’S INGLENOOK.* ONE MAY BUY HIM FOR EIGHTEEN PENCE NOW. HE IS MARKED THREE AND SIXPENCE BUT THE BOOKSELLER’S WIFE SEEING HOW SHABBY THE COVERS ARE AND HOW LONG THE BOOK HAS STOOD THERE SINCE IT WAS BOUGHT AT SOME SALE OF A GENTLEMAN’S LIBRARY IN SUFFOLK WILL LET IT GO AT THAT.

THUS GLANCING ROUND THE BOOKSHOP WE MAKE OTHER SUCH SUDDEN CAPRICIOUS FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE UNKNOWN AND THE VANISHED WHOSE ONLY RECORD IS FOR EXAMPLE THIS LITTLE BOOK OF POEMS SO FAIRLY PRINTED SO FINELY ENGRAVED TOO WITH A PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR. FOR HE WAS A POET AND DROWNED UNTIMELY* AND HIS VERSE MILD AS IT IS AND FORMAL AND SENTENTIOUS SENDS FORTH STILL A FRAIL FLUTY SOUND LIKE THAT OF A PIANO ORGAN PLAYED IN SOME BACK STREET RESIGNEDLY BY AN OLD ITALIAN ORGAN-GRINDER IN A CORDUROY JACKET. THERE ARE TRAVELLERS TOO ROW UPON ROW OF THEM STILL TESTIFYING INDOMITABLE SPINSTERS THAT THEY WERE TO THE DISCOMFORTS THAT THEY ENDURED AND THE SUNSETS THEY ADMIRED IN GREECE WHEN QUEEN VICTORIA WAS A A GIRL; A TOUR IN CORNWALL WITH A VISIT TO THE TIN MINES WAS THOUGHT WORTHY OF VOLUMINOUS RECORD. PEOPLE WENT SLOWLY UP THE RHINE AND DID PORTRAITS OF EACH OTHER IN INDIAN INK SITTING READING ON DECK BESIDE A COIL OF ROPE; THEY MEASURED THE PYRAMIDS; WERE LOST TO CIVILIZATION FOR YEARS; CONVERTED NEGROES IN PESTILENTIAL SWAMPS. THIS PACKING UP AND GOING OFF EXPLORING DESERTS AND CATCHING FEVERS SETTLING IN INDIA FOR A LIFETIME PENETRATING EVEN TO CHINA AND THEN RETURNING TO LEAD A PAROCHIAL LIFE AT EDMONTON TUMBLES AND TOSSES UPON THE DUSTY FLOOR LIKE AN UNEASY SEA SO RESTLESS THE ENGLISH ARE WITH THE WAVES AT THEIR VERY DOOR. THE WATERS OF TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE SEEM TO BREAK UPON LITTLE ISLANDS OF SERIOUS EFFORT AND LIFELONG INDUSTRY STOOD IN JAGGED COLUMNS UPON THE FLOOR. IN THESE PILES OF PUCE-BOUND VOLUMES WITH GILT MONOGRAMS ON THE BACK THOUGHTFUL CLERGYMEN EXPOUND THE GOSPELS; SCHOLARS ARE TO BE HEARD WITH THEIR HAMMERS AND THEIR CHISELS CHIPPING CLEAR THE ANCIENT TEXTS OF EURIPIDES AND AESCHYLUS.* THINKING ANNOTATING EXPOUNDING GOES ON AT A PRODIGIOUS RATE ALL ROUND US AND OVER EVERYTHING LIKE A PUNCTUAL EVERLASTING TIDE WASHES THE ANCIENT SEA OF FICTION. INNUMERABLE VOLUMES TELL HOW ARTHUR LOVED LAURA AND THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THEY WERE UNHAPPY AND THEN THEY MET AND THEY WERE HAPPY EVER AFTER AS WAS THE WAY WHEN VICTORIA RULED THESE ISLANDS.

THE NUMBER OF BOOKS IN THE WORLD IS INFINITE AND ONE IS FORCED TO GLIMPSE AND NOD AND GO ON AFTER A MOMENT OF TALK A FLASH OF UNDERSTANDING AS IN THE STREET OUTSIDE ONE CATCHES A WORD IN PASSING AND FROM A CHANCE PHRASE FABRICATES A LIFETIME. IT IS ABOUT A WOMAN CALLED KATE THAT THEY ARE TALKING HOW ‘I SAID TO HER QUITE STRAIGHT LAST NIGHT … IF YOU DON’T THINK I’M WORTH A PENNY STAMP I SAID …’ BUT WHO KATE IS AND TO WHAT CRISIS IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP THE PENNY STAMP REFERS WE SHALL NEVER KNOW; FOR KATE SINKS UNDER THE WARMTH OF THEIR VOLUBILITY; AND HERE AT THE STREET CORNER ANOTHER PAGE OF THE VOLUME OF LIFE IS LAID OPEN BY THE SIGHT OF TWO MEN CONSULTING UNDER THE LAMP-POST. THEY ARE SPELLING OUT THE LATEST WIRE FROM NEWMARKET IN THE STOP PRESS NEWS.* DO THEY THINK THEN THAT FORTUNE WILL EVER CONVERT THEIR RAGS INTO FUR AND BROADCLOTH SLING THEM WITH WATCH-CHAINS AND PLANT DIAMOND PINS WHERE THERE IS NOW A RAGGED OPEN SHIRT? BUT THE MAIN STREAM OF WALKERS AT THIS HOUR SWEEPS TOO FAST TO LET US ASK SUCH QUESTIONS. THEY ARE WRAPT IN THIS SHORT PASSAGE FROM WORK TO HOME IN SOME NARCOTIC DREAM NOW THAT THEY ARE FREE FROM THE DESK AND HAVE THE FRESH AIR ON THEIR CHEEKS. THEY PUT ON THOSE BRIGHT CLOTHES WHICH THEY MUST HANG UP AND LOCK THE KEY UPON ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND ARE GREAT CRICKETERS FAMOUS ACTRESSES SOLDIERS WHO HAVE SAVED THEIR COUNTRY AT THE HOUR OF NEED. DREAMING GESTICULATING OFTEN MUTTERING A FEW WORDS ALOUD THEY SWEEP OVER THE STRAND AND ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE WHENCE THEY WILL BE SWUNG IN LONG RATTLING TRAINS STILL DREAMING TO SOME PRIM LITTLE VILLA IN BARNES OR SURBITON WHERE THE SIGHT OF THE CLOCK IN THE HALL AND THE SMELL OF THE SUPPER IN THE BASEMENT PUNCTURE THE DREAM.

BUT WE ARE COME TO THE STRAND NOW AND AS WE HESITATE ON THE KERB A LITTLE ROD ABOUT THE LENGTH OF ONE’S FINGER BEGINS TO LAY ITS BAR ACROSS THE VELOCITY AND ABUNDANCE OF LIFE. ‘REALLY I MUST—REALLY I MUST’—THAT IS IT. WITHOUT INVESTIGATING THE DEMAND THE MIND CRINGES TO THE ACCUSTOMED TYRANT. ONE MUST ONE ALWAYS MUST DO SOMETHING OR OTHER; IT IS NOT ALLOWED ONE SIMPLY TO ENJOY ONESELF. WAS IT NOT FOR THIS REASON THAT SOME TIME AGO WE FABRICATED THAT EXCUSE AND INVENTED THE NECESSITY OF BUYING SOMETHING? BUT WHAT WAS IT? AH WE REMEMBER IT WAS A PENCIL. LET US GO THEN AND BUY THIS PENCIL. BUT JUST AS WE ARE TURNING TO OBEY THE COMMAND ANOTHER SELF DISPUTES THE RIGHT OF THE TYRANT TO INSIST. THE USUAL CONFLICT COMES ABOUT. SPREAD OUT BEHIND THE ROD OF DUTY WE SEE THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THE RIVER THAMES—WIDE MOURNFUL PEACEFUL. AND WE SEE IT THROUGH THE EYES OF SOMEBODY WHO IS LEANING OVER THE EMBANKMENT ON A SUMMER EVENING WITHOUT A CARE IN THE WORLD. LET US PUT OFF BUYING THE PENCIL; LET US GO IN SEARCH OF THIS PERSON (AND SOON IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THIS PERSON IS OURSELVES). FOR IF WE COULD STAND THERE WHERE WE STOOD SIX MONTHS AGO SHOULD WE NOT BE AGAIN AS WE WERE THEN—CALM ALOOF CONTENT? LET US TRY THEN. BUT THE RIVER IS ROUGHER AND GREYER THAN WE REMEMBERED. THE TIDE IS RUNNING OUT TO SEA. IT BRINGS DOWN WITH IT A TUG AND TWO BARGES WHOSE LOAD OF STRAW IS TIGHTLY BOUND DOWN BENEATH TARPAULIN COVERS. THERE IS TOO CLOSE BY US A COUPLE LEANING OVER THE BALUSTRADE MURMURING WITH THAT CURIOUS LACK OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH LOVERS HAVE AS IF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AFFAIR THEY ARE ENGAGED ON CLAIMS WITHOUT QUESTION THE INDULGENCE OF THE HUMAN RACE. THE SIGHTS WE SEE AND THE SOUNDS WE HEAR NOW HAVE NONE OF THE QUALITY OF THE PAST; NOR HAVE WE ANY SHARE IN THE SERENITY OF THE PERSON WHO SIX MONTHS AGO STOOD PRECISELY WHERE WE STAND NOW. HIS IS THE HAPPINESS OF DEATH; OURS THE INSECURITY OF LIFE. HE HAS NO FUTURE; THE FUTURE IS EVEN NOW INVADING OUR PEACE. IT IS ONLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PAST AND TAKE FROM IT THE ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WE CAN ENJOY PERFECT PEACE. AS IT IS WE MUST TURN WE MUST CROSS THE STRAND AGAIN WE MUST FIND A SHOP WHERE EVEN AT THIS HOUR THEY WILL BE READY TO SELL US A PENCIL.

IT IS ALWAYS AN ADVENTURE TO ENTER A NEW ROOM; FOR THE LIVES AND CHARACTERS OF ITS OWNERS HAVE DISTILLED THEIR ATMOSPHERE INTO IT AND DIRECTLY WE ENTER IT WE BREAST SOME NEW WAVE OF EMOTION. HERE WITHOUT A DOUBT IN THE STATIONER’S SHOP PEOPLE HAD BEEN QUARRELLING. THEIR ANGER SHOT THROUGH THE AIR. THEY BOTH STOPPED; THE OLD WOMAN—THEY WERE HUSBAND AND WIFE EVIDENTLY—RETIRED TO A BACK ROOM; THE OLD MAN WHOSE ROUNDED FOREHEAD AND GLOBULAR EYES WOULD HAVE LOOKED WELL ON THE FRONTISPIECE OF SOME ELIZABETHAN FOLIO STAYED TO SERVE US. ‘A PENCIL A PENCIL’ HE REPEATED ‘CERTAINLY CERTAINLY.’ HE SPOKE WITH THE DISTRACTION YET EFFUSIVENESS OF ONE WHOSE EMOTIONS HAVE BEEN ROUSED AND CHECKED IN FULL FLOOD. HE BEGAN OPENING BOX AFTER BOX AND SHUTTING THEM AGAIN. HE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND THINGS WHEN THEY KEPT SO MANY DIFFERENT ARTICLES. HE LAUNCHED INTO A STORY ABOUT SOME LEGAL GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GOT INTO DEEP WATERS OWING TO THE CONDUCT OF HIS WIFE. HE HAD KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS; HE HAD BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE TEMPLE* FOR HALF A CENTURY HE SAID AS IF HE WISHED HIS WIFE IN THE BACK ROOM TO OVERHEAR HIM. HE UPSET A BOX OF RUBBER BANDS. AT LAST EXASPERATED BY HIS INCOMPETENCE HE PUSHED THE SWING DOOR OPEN AND CALLED OUT ROUGHLY ‘WHERE D’YOU KEEP THE PENCILS?’ AS IF HIS WIFE HAD HIDDEN THEM. THE OLD LADY CAME IN. LOOKING AT NOBODY SHE PUT HER HAND WITH A FINE AIR OF RIGHTEOUS SEVERITY UPON THE RIGHT BOX. THERE WERE PENCILS. HOW THEN COULD HE DO WITHOUT HER? WAS SHE NOT INDISPENSABLE TO HIM? IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM THERE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE IN FORCED NEUTRALITY ONE HAD TO BE PARTICULAR IN ONE’S CHOICE OF PENCILS; THIS WAS TOO SOFT THAT TOO HARD. THEY STOOD SILENTLY LOOKING ON. THE LONGER THEY STOOD THERE THE CALMER THEY GREW; THEIR HEAT WAS GOING DOWN THEIR ANGER DISAPPEARING. NOW WITHOUT A WORD SAID ON EITHER SIDE THE QUARREL WAS MADE UP. THE OLD MAN WHO WOULD NOT HAVE DISGRACED BEN JONSON’S* TITLE-PAGE REACHED THE BOX BACK TO ITS PROPER PLACE BOWED PROFOUNDLY HIS GOOD-NIGHT TO US AND THEY DISAPPEARED. SHE WOULD GET OUT HER SEWING; HE WOULD READ HIS NEWSPAPER; THE CANARY WOULD SCATTER THEM IMPARTIALLY WITH SEED. THE QUARREL WAS OVER.

DURING THESE MINUTES IN WHICH A GHOST HAS BEEN SOUGHT FOR A QUARREL COMPOSED AND A PENCIL BOUGHT THE STREETS HAD BECOME COMPLETELY EMPTY. LIFE HAD WITHDRAWN TO THE TOP FLOOR AND LAMPS WERE LIT. THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY AND HARD; THE ROAD WAS OF HAMMERED SILVER. WALKING HOME THROUGH THE DESOLATION ONE COULD TELL ONESELF THE STORY OF THE DWARF OF THE BLIND MEN OF THE PARTY IN THE MAYFAIR MANSION OF THE QUARREL IN THE STATIONER’S SHOP. INTO EACH OF THESE LIVES ONE COULD PENETRATE A LITTLE WAY FAR ENOUGH TO GIVE ONESELF THE ILLUSION THAT ONE IS NOT TETHERED TO A SINGLE MIND BUT CAN PUT ON BRIEFLY FOR A FEW MINUTES THE BODIES AND MINDS OF OTHERS. ONE COULD BECOME A WASHERWOMAN A PUBLICAN A STREET SINGER. AND WHAT GREATER DELIGHT AND WONDER CAN THERE BE THAN TO LEAVE THE STRAIGHT LINES OF PERSONALITY AND DEVIATE INTO THOSE FOOTPATHS THAT LEAD BENEATH BRAMBLES AND THICK TREE TRUNKS INTO THE HEART OF THE FOREST WHERE LIVE THOSE WILD BEASTS OUR FELLOW MEN?

THAT IS TRUE: TO ESCAPE IS THE GREATEST OF PLEASURES; STREET HAUNTING IN WINTER THE GREATEST OF ADVENTURES. STILL AS WE APPROACH OUR OWN DOORSTEP AGAIN IT IS COMFORTING TO FEEL THE OLD POSSESSIONS THE OLD PREJUDICES FOLD US ROUND AND SHELTER AND ENCLOSE THE SELF WHICH HAS BEEN BLOWN ABOUT AT SO MANY STREET CORNERS WHICH HAS BATTERED LIKE A MOTH AT THE FLAME OF SO MANY INACCESSIBLE LANTERNS SHELTERED AND ENCLOSED. HERE AGAIN IS THE USUAL DOOR; HERE THE CHAIR TURNED AS WE LEFT IT AND THE CHINA BOWL AND THE BROWN RING ON THE CARPET. AND HERE—LET US EXAMINE IT TENDERLY LET US TOUCH IT WITH REVERENCE—IS THE ONLY SPOIL WE HAVE RETRIEVED FROM THE TREASURES OF THE CITY A LEAD PENCIL.

THE SUN AND THE FISH
IT IS AN AMUSING GAME ESPECIALLY FOR A DARK WINTER’S MORNING. ONE SAYS TO THE EYE ATHENS; SEGESTA;* QUEEN VICTORIA; AND ONE WAITS AS SUBMISSIVELY AS POSSIBLE TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. AND PERHAPS NOTHING HAPPENS AND PERHAPS A GREAT MANY THINGS HAPPEN BUT NOT THE THINGS ONE MIGHT EXPECT. THE OLD LADY IN HORN SPECTACLES—OUR LATE QUEEN—IS VIVID ENOUGH; BUT SOMEHOW SHE HAS ALLIED HERSELF WITH A SOLDIER IN PICCADILLY WHO IS STOOPING TO PICK UP A COIN; WITH A YELLOW CAMEL WHO IS SWAYING THROUGH AN ARCHWAY IN KENSINGTON GARDENS; WITH A KITCHEN CHAIR AND A DISTINGUISHED OLD GENTLEMAN WAVING HIS HAT. DROPPED YEARS AGO INTO THE MIND SHE HAS BECOME STUCK ABOUT WITH ALL SORTS OF ALIEN MATTER. WHEN ONE SAYS QUEEN VICTORIA ONE DRAWS UP THE MOST HETEROGENEOUS COLLECTION OF OBJECTS WHICH IT WILL TAKE A WEEK AT LEAST TO SORT. ON THE OTHER HAND ONE MAY SAY TO ONESELF MONT BLANC AT DAWN; THE TAJ MAHAL IN THE MOONLIGHT; AND THE MIND REMAINS A BLANK. FOR A SIGHT WILL ONLY SURVIVE IN THE QUEER POOL IN WHICH WE DEPOSIT OUR MEMORIES IF IT HAS THE GOOD LUCK TO ALLY ITSELF WITH SOME OTHER EMOTION BY WHICH IT IS PRESERVED. SIGHTS MARRY INCONGRUOUSLY MORGANATICALLY (LIKE THE QUEEN AND THE CAMEL) AND SO KEEP EACH OTHER ALIVE. MONT BLANC THE TAJ MAHAL SIGHTS WHICH WE TRAVELLED AND TOILED TO SEE FADE AND PERISH AND DISAPPEAR BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO FIND THE RIGHT MATE. ON OUR DEATH-BEDS IT IS POSSIBLE WE SHALL SEE NOTHING MORE MAJESTIC THAN A CAT AND AN OLD WOMAN IN A SUNBONNET. THE GREAT SIGHTS WILL HAVE DIED FOR LACK OF MATES.

SO ON THIS DARK WINTER’S MORNING WHEN THE REAL WORLD HAS FADED LET US SEE WHAT THE EYE CAN DO FOR US. SHOW ME THE ECLIPSE WE SAY TO THE EYE; LET US SEE THAT STRANGE SPECTACLE AGAIN.* AND WE SEE AT ONCE—BUT THE MIND’S EYE IS ONLY BY COURTESY AN EYE; IT IS A NERVE WHICH HEARS AND SMELLS WHICH TRANSMITS HEAT AND COLD WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THE BRAIN AND ROUSES THE MIND TO DISCRIMINATE AND SPECULATE—IT IS ONLY FOR BREVITY’S SAKE THAT WE SAY THAT WE ‘SEE’ AT ONCE A RAILWAY STATION AT NIGHT. A CROWD IS GATHERED AT A BARRIER; BUT HOW CURIOUS A CROWD! MACKINTOSHES ARE SLUNG OVER THEIR ARMS; IN THEIR HANDS THEY CARRY LITTLE CASES. THEY HAVE A PROVISIONAL EXTEMPORISED LOOK. THEY HAVE THAT MOVING AND DISTURBING UNITY WHICH COMES FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY (BUT HERE IT WOULD BE MORE PROPER TO SAY ‘WE’) HAVE A PURPOSE IN COMMON. NEVER WAS THERE A STRANGER PURPOSE THAN THAT WHICH BROUGHT US TOGETHER THAT JUNE NIGHT IN EUSTON RAILWAY STATION. WE WERE COME TO SEE THE DAWN. TRAINS LIKE OURS WERE STARTING ALL OVER ENGLAND AT THAT VERY MOMENT TO SEE THE DAWN. ALL NOSES WERE POINTING NORTH. WHEN FOR A MOMENT WE HALTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTRY THERE WERE THE PALE YELLOW LIGHTS OF MOTOR CARS ALSO POINTING NORTH. THERE WAS NO SLEEP NO FIXITY IN ENGLAND THAT NIGHT. ALL WERE TRAVELLING NORTH. ALL WERE THINKING OF THE DAWN. AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE SKY WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF SO MANY MILLION THOUGHTS ASSUMED GREATER SUBSTANCE AND PROMINENCE THAN USUAL. THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WHITISH SOFT CANOPY ABOVE US INCREASED IN WEIGHT AS THE HOURS PASSED. WHEN IN THE CHILL EARLY MORNING WE WERE TURNED OUT ON A YORKSHIRE ROAD-SIDE OUR SENSES HAD ORIENTATED THEMSELVES DIFFERENTLY FROM USUAL. WE WERE NO LONGER IN THE SAME RELATION TO PEOPLE HOUSES AND TREES; WE WERE RELATED TO THE WHOLE WORLD. WE HAD COME NOT TO LODGE IN THE BEDROOM OF AN INN; WE WERE COME FOR A FEW HOURS OF DISEMBODIED INTERCOURSE WITH THE SKY.

EVERYTHING WAS VERY PALE. THE RIVER WAS PALE AND THE FIELDS BRIMMING WITH GRASSES AND TASSELLED FLOWERS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN RED HAD NO COLOUR IN THEM BUT LAY THERE WHISPERING AND WAVING ROUND COLOURLESS FARM-HOUSES. NOW THE FARM-HOUSE DOOR WOULD OPEN AND OUT WOULD STEP TO JOIN THE PROCESSION THE FARMER AND HIS FAMILY IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES NEAT DARK AND SILENT AS IF THEY WERE GOING UP HILL TO CHURCH; OR SOMETIMES WOMEN MERELY LEANT ON THE WINDOW SILLS OF THE UPPER ROOMS WATCHING THE PROCESSION PASS WITH AMUSED CONTEMPT IT APPEARED—THEY HAVE COME SUCH HUNDREDS OF MILES AND FOR WHAT? THEY SEEMED TO SAY—IN COMPLETE SILENCE. WE HAD AN ODD SENSE OF KEEPING AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN ACTOR OF SUCH VAST PROPORTIONS THAT HE WOULD COME SILENTLY AND BE EVERYWHERE.

BY THE TIME WE WERE AT THE MEETING PLACE ON A HIGH FELL WHERE THE HILLS STRETCHED THEIR LIMBS OUT OVER THE FLOWING BROWN MOORLAND BELOW WE HAD PUT ON TOO—THOUGH WE WERE COLD AND WITH OUR FEET STOOD IN RED BOG WATER WERE LIKELY TO BE STILL COLDER THOUGH SOME OF US WERE SQUATTED ON MACKINTOSHS AMONG CUPS AND PLATES EATING AND OTHERS WERE FANTASTICALLY ACCOUTRED AND NONE WERE AT THEIR BEST—STILL WE HAD PUT ON A CERTAIN DIGNITY. RATHER PERHAPS WE HAD PUT OFF THE LITTLE BADGES AND SIGNS OF INDIVIDUALITY. WE WERE STRUNG OUT AGAINST THE SKY IN OUTLINE AND HAD THE LOOK OF STATUES STANDING PROMINENT ON THE RIDGE OF THE WORLD. WE WERE VERY VERY OLD; WE WERE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE PRIMEVAL WORLD COME TO SALUTE THE DAWN. SO THE WORSHIPPERS AT STONEHENGE MUST HAVE LOOKED AMONG TUSSOCKS OF GRASS AND BOULDERS OF ROCK. SUDDENLY FROM THE MOTOR CAR OF SOME YORKSHIRE SQUIRE THERE BOUNDED FOUR LARGE LEAN RED DOGS HOUNDS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD HUNTING DOGS THEY SEEMED LEAPING WITH THEIR NOSES CLOSE TO THE GROUND ON THE TRACK OF BOAR OR DEER. MEANWHILE THE SUN WAS RISING. A CLOUD GLOWED AS A WHITE SHADE GLOWS WHEN THE LIGHT IS SLOWLY TURNED UP BEHIND IT. GOLDEN WEDGE-SHAPED STREAMERS FELL DOWN FROM IT AND MARKED THE TREES IN THE VALLEY GREEN AND THE VILLAGES BLUE-BROWN. IN THE SKY BEHIND US THERE SWAM WHITE ISLANDS IN PALE BLUE LAKES. THE SKY WAS OPEN AND FREE THERE BUT IN FRONT OF US A SOFT SNOW BANK HAD MASSED ITSELF. YET AS WE LOOKED WE SAW IT PROVING WORN AND THIN IN PATCHES. THE GOLD MOMENTARILY INCREASED MELTING THE WHITENESS TO A FIERY GAUZE AND THIS GREW FRAILER AND FRAILER TILL FOR ONE INSTANT WE SAW THE SUN IN FULL SPLENDOUR. THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE. THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SUSPENSE LIKE THAT WHICH PRECEDES A RACE. THE STARTER HELD HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND COUNTING THE SECONDS. NOW THEY WERE OFF.

THE SUN HAD TO RACE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND TO REACH THE GOAL WHICH WAS A THIN TRANSPARENCY TO THE RIGHT BEFORE THE SACRED SECONDS WERE UP. HE STARTED. THE CLOUDS FLUNG EVERY OBSTACLE IN HIS WAY. THEY CLUNG THEY IMPEDED. HE DASHED THROUGH THEM. HE COULD BE FELT FLASHING AND FLYING WHEN HE WAS INVISIBLE. HIS SPEED WAS TREMENDOUS. HERE HE WAS OUT AND BRIGHT; NOW HE WAS UNDER AND LOST. BUT ALWAYS ONE FELT HIM FLYING AND THRUSTING THROUGH THE MURK TO HIS GOAL. FOR ONE SECOND HE EMERGED AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO US THROUGH OUR GLASSES A HOLLOWED SUN A CRESCENT SUN. IT WAS A PROOF PERHAPS THAT HE WAS DOING HIS BEST FOR US. NOW HE WENT UNDER HIS LAST EFFORT. NOW HE WAS COMPLETELY BLOTTED OUT. THE MOMENTS PASSED. WATCHES WERE HELD IN HAND AFTER HAND. THE SACRED TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS WERE BEGUN. UNLESS HE COULD WIN THROUGH BEFORE THE LAST ONE WAS OVER HE WAS LOST. STILL ONE FELT HIM TEARING AND RACING BEHIND THE CLOUDS TO WIN FREE; BUT THE CLOUDS HELD HIM. THEY SPREAD; THEY THICKENED; THEY SLACKENED THEY MUFFLED HIS SPEED. OF THE TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS ONLY FIVE REMAINED AND STILL HE WAS OBSCURED. AND AS THE FATAL SECONDS PASSED AND WE REALISED THAT THE SUN WAS BEING DEFEATED HAD NOW INDEED LOST THE RACE ALL THE COLOUR BEGAN TO GO FROM THE MOOR. THE BLUE TURNED TO PURPLE; THE WHITE BECAME LIVID AS AT THE APPROACH OF A VIOLENT BUT WINDLESS STORM. PINK FACES WENT GREEN AND IT BECAME COLDER THAN EVER. THIS WAS THE DEFEAT OF THE SUN THEN AND THIS WAS ALL SO WE THOUGHT TURNING IN DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THE DULL CLOUD BLANKET IN FRONT OF US TO THE MOORS BEHIND. THEY WERE LIVID THEY WERE PURPLE; BUT SUDDENLY ONE BECAME AWARE THAT SOMETHING MORE WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN; SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AWFUL UNAVOIDABLE. THE SHADOW GROWING DARKER AND DARKER OVER THE MOOR WAS LIKE THE HEELING OVER OF A BOAT WHICH INSTEAD OF RIGHTING ITSELF AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT TURNS A LITTLE FURTHER AND THEN A LITTLE FURTHER; AND SUDDENLY CAPSIZES. SO THE LIGHT TURNED AND HEELED OVER AND WENT OUT. THIS WAS THE END. THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF THE WORLD WAS DEAD AND ONLY THE SKELETON WAS LEFT. IT HUNG BENEATH US FRAIL; BROWN; DEAD; WITHERED. THEN WITH SOME TRIFLING MOVEMENT THIS PROFOUND OBEISANCE OF THE LIGHT THIS STOOPING DOWN AND ABASEMENT OF ALL SPLENDOUR WAS OVER. LIGHTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD UP IT ROSE; IT SPRANG UP AS IF THE ONE MOVEMENT AFTER A SECOND’S TREMENDOUS PAUSE COMPLETED THE OTHER AND THE LIGHT WHICH HAD DIED HERE ROSE AGAIN ELSEWHERE. NEVER WAS THERE SUCH A SENSE OF REJUVENESCENCE AND RECOVERY. ALL THE CONVALESCENCES AND RESPITE OF LIFE SEEMED ROLLED INTO ONE. YET AT FIRST SO PALE AND FRAIL AND STRANGE THE LIGHT WAS SPRINKLED RAINBOW-LIKE IN A HOOP OF COLOUR THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE EARTH COULD NEVER LIVE DECKED OUT IN SUCH FRAIL TINTS. IT HUNG BENEATH US LIKE A CAGE LIKE A HOOP LIKE A GLOBE OF GLASS. IT MIGHT BE BLOWN OUT; IT MIGHT BE STOVE IN. BUT STEADILY AND SURELY OUR RELIEF BROADENED AND OUR CONFIDENCE ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS THE GREAT PAINT BRUSH WASHED IN WOODS DARK ON THE VALLEY AND MASSED THE HILLS BLUE ABOVE THEM. THE WORLD BECAME MORE AND MORE SOLID; IT BECAME POPULOUS; IT BECAME A PLACE WHERE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FARM-HOUSES OF VILLAGES OF RAILWAY LINES HAVE LODGMENT; UNTIL THE WHOLE FABRIC OF CIVILISATION WAS MODELLED AND MOULDED. BUT STILL THE MEMORY ENDURED THAT THE EARTH WE STAND ON IS MADE OF COLOUR; COLOUR CAN BE BLOWN OUT; AND THEN WE STAND ON A DEAD LEAF; AND WE WHO TREAD THE EARTH SECURELY NOW HAVE SEEN IT DEAD.

BUT THE EYE HAS NOT DONE WITH US YET. IN PURSUIT OF SOME LOGIC OF ITS OWN WHICH WE CANNOT FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY IT NOW PRESENTS US WITH A PICTURE OR GENERALISED IMPRESSION RATHER OF LONDON ON A HOT SUMMER DAY WHEN TO JUDGE BY THE SENSE OF CONCUSSION AND CONFUSION THE LONDON SEASON IS AT ITS HEIGHT. IT TAKES US A MOMENT TO REALISE FIRST THAT WE ARE IN SOME PUBLIC GARDENS NEXT FROM THE ASPHALT AND THE PAPERBAGS STREWN ABOUT THAT IT MUST BE THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN* AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER PREPARATION WE ARE PRESENTED WITH THE COMPLETE AND PERFECT EFFIGY OF TWO LIZARDS. AFTER DESTRUCTION CALM; AFTER RUIN STEADFASTNESS—THAT PERHAPS IS THE LOGIC OF THE EYE. AT ANY RATE ONE LIZARD IS MOUNTED IMMOBILE ON THE BACK OF ANOTHER WITH ONLY THE TWINKLE OF A GOLD EYE-LID OR THE SUCTION OF A GREEN FLANK TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE LIVING FLESH AND NOT MADE OF BRONZE. ALL HUMAN PASSION SEEMS FURTIVE AND FEVERISH BESIDE THIS STILL RAPTURE. TIME SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED AND WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF IMMORTALITY. THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD HAS FALLEN FROM US LIKE A CRUMBLING CLOUD. TANKS CUT IN THE LEVEL BLACKNESS ENCLOSE SQUARES OF IMMORTALITY WORLDS OF SETTLED SUNSHINE WHERE THERE IS NEITHER RAIN NOR CLOUD. THERE THE INHABITANTS PERFORM FOR EVER EVOLUTIONS WHOSE INTRICACY BECAUSE IT HAS NO REASON SEEMS THE MORE SUBLIME. BLUE AND SILVER ARMIES KEEPING A PERFECT DISTANCE FOR ALL THEIR ARROW-LIKE QUICKNESS SHOOT FIRST THIS WAY THEN THAT. THE DISCIPLINE IS PERFECT THE CONTROL ABSOLUTE; REASON THERE IS NONE. THE MOST MAJESTIC OF HUMAN EVOLUTIONS SEEMS FEEBLE AND FLUCTUATING COMPARED WITH THE FISHES’. EACH OF THESE WORLDS TOO WHICH MEASURES PERHAPS FOUR FEET BY FIVE IS AS PERFECT IN ITS ORDER AS IN ITS METHOD. FOR FORESTS THEY HAVE HALF A DOZEN BAMBOO CANES; FOR MOUNTAINS SAND-HILLS; IN THE CURVES AND CRINKLES OF A SEA-SHELL LIE FOR THEM ALL ADVENTURE ALL ROMANCE. THE RISE OF A BUBBLE NEGLIGIBLE ELSEWHERE IS HERE AN EVENT OF THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE. THE SILVER DROP BORES ITS WAY UP A SPIRAL STAIRCASE THROUGH THE WATER TO BURST AGAINST THE SHEET OF GLASS WHICH SEEMS LAID FLAT ACROSS THE TOP. NOTHING EXISTS NEEDLESSLY. THE FISH THEMSELVES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SHAPED DELIBERATELY AND SLIPPED INTO THE WORLD ONLY TO BE THEMSELVES. THEY NEITHER WORK NOR WEEP. IN THEIR SHAPE IS THEIR REASON. FOR WHAT OTHER PURPOSE EXCEPT THE SUFFICIENT ONE OF PERFECT EXISTENCE CAN THEY HAVE BEEN THUS MADE SOME SO ROUND SOME SO THIN SOME WITH RADIATING FINS UPON THEIR BACKS OTHERS LINED WITH RED ELECTRIC LIGHT OTHERS UNDULATING LIKE WHITE PANCAKES ON A FRYING PAN SOME ARMOURED IN BLUE MAIL SOME GIVEN PRODIGIOUS CLAWS SOME OUTRAGEOUSLY FRINGED WITH HUGE WHISKERS? MORE CARE HAS BEEN SPENT UPON HALF A DOZEN FISH THAN UPON ALL THE RACES OF MANKIND. UNDER OUR TWEED AND SILK IS NOTHING BUT A MONOTONY OF PINK NAKEDNESS. POETS ARE NOT TRANSPARENT TO THE BACKBONE AS THESE FISH ARE. BANKERS HAVE NO CLAWS. KINGS AND QUEENS THEMSELVES WEAR NEITHER RUFFS NOR FRILLS. IN SHORT IF WE WERE TO BE TURNED NAKED INTO AN AQUARIUM—BUT ENOUGH. THE EYE SHUTS NOW. IT HAS SHOWN US A DEAD WORLD AND AN IMMORTAL FISH.

THE DOCKS OF LONDON
‘WHITHER O SPLENDID SHIP’ THE POET ASKED* AS HE LAY ON THE SHORE AND WATCHED THE GREAT SAILING SHIP PASS AWAY ON THE HORIZON. PERHAPS AS HE IMAGINED IT WAS MAKING FOR SOME PORT IN THE PACIFIC; BUT ONE DAY ALMOST CERTAINLY IT MUST HAVE HEARD AN IRRESISTIBLE CALL AND COME PAST THE NORTH FORELAND AND THE RECULVERS AND ENTERED THE NARROW WATERS OF THE PORT OF LONDON SAILED PAST THE LOW BANKS OF GRAVESEND AND NORTHFLEET AND TILBURY UP ERITH REACH AND BARKING REACH AND GALLION’S REACH PAST THE GAS WORKS AND THE SEWAGE WORKS TILL IT FOUND FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A CAR ON A PARKING GROUND A SPACE RESERVED FOR IT IN THE DEEP WATERS OF THE DOCKS. THERE IT FURLED ITS SAILS AND DROPPED ANCHOR.

HOWEVER ROMANTIC AND FREE AND FITFUL THEY MAY SEEM THERE IS SCARCELY A SHIP ON THE SEAS THAT DOES NOT COME TO ANCHOR IN THE PORT OF LONDON IN TIME. FROM A LAUNCH IN MIDSTREAM ONE CAN SEE THEM SWIMMING UP THE RIVER WITH ALL THE MARKS OF THEIR VOYAGE STILL ON THEM.* LINERS COME HIGH-DECKED WITH THEIR GALLERIES AND THEIR AWNINGS AND THEIR PASSENGERS GRASPING THEIR BAGS AND LEANING OVER THE RAIL WHILE THE LASCARS TUMBLE AND SCURRY BELOW—HOME THEY COME A THOUSAND OF THESE BIG SHIPS EVERY WEEK OF THE YEAR TO ANCHOR IN THE DOCKS OF LONDON. THEY TAKE THEIR WAY MAJESTICALLY THROUGH A CROWD OF TRAMP STEAMERS AND COLLIERS AND BARGES HEAPED WITH COAL AND SWAYING RED SAILED BOATS WHICH AMATEURISH THOUGH THEY LOOK ARE BRINGING BRICKS FROM HARWICH OR CEMENT FROM COLCHESTER—FOR ALL IS BUSINESS; THERE ARE NO PLEASURE BOATS ON THIS RIVER. DRAWN BY SOME IRRESISTIBLE CURRENT THEY COME FROM THE STORMS AND CALMS OF THE SEA ITS SILENCE AND LONELINESS TO THEIR ALLOTTED ANCHORAGE. THE ENGINES STOP; THE SAILS ARE FURLED; AND SUDDENLY THE GAUDY FUNNELS AND THE TALL MASTS SHOW UP INCONGRUOUSLY AGAINST A ROW OF WORKMEN’S HOUSES AGAINST THE BLACK WALLS OF HUGE WAREHOUSES. A CURIOUS CHANGE TAKES PLACE. THEY HAVE NO LONGER THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE OF SEA AND SKY BEHIND THEM AND NO LONGER THE PROPER SPACE IN WHICH TO STRETCH THEIR LIMBS. THEY LIE CAPTIVE LIKE SOARING AND WINGED CREATURES WHO HAVE GOT THEMSELVES CAUGHT BY THE LEG AND LIE TETHERED ON DRY LAND.

WITH THE SEA BLOWING ITS SALT INTO OUR NOSTRILS NOTHING CAN BE MORE STIMULATING THAN TO WATCH THE SHIPS COMING UP THE THAMES—THE BIG SHIPS AND THE LITTLE SHIPS THE BATTERED AND THE SPLENDID SHIPS FROM INDIA FROM RUSSIA FROM SOUTH AMERICA SHIPS FROM AUSTRALIA COMING FROM SILENCE AND DANGER AND LONELINESS PAST US HOME TO HARBOUR. BUT ONCE THEY DROP ANCHOR ONCE THE CRANES BEGIN THEIR DIPPING AND THEIR SWINGING IT SEEMS AS IF ALL ROMANCE WERE OVER. IF WE TURN AND GO PAST THE ANCHORED SHIPS TOWARDS LONDON WE SEE SURELY THE MOST DISMAL PROSPECT IN THE WORLD. THE BANKS OF THE RIVER ARE LINED WITH DINGY DECREPIT-LOOKING WAREHOUSES. THEY HUDDLE ON LAND THAT HAS BECOME FLAT AND SLIMY MUD. THE SAME AIR OF DECREPITUDE AND OF BEING RUN UP PROVISIONALLY STAMPS THEM ALL. IF A WINDOW IS BROKEN BROKEN IT REMAINS. A FIRE THAT HAS LATELY BLACKENED AND BLISTERED ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT IT NO MORE FORLORN AND JOYLESS THAN ITS NEIGHBOURS. BEHIND THE MASTS AND FUNNELS LIES A SINISTER DWARF CITY OF WORKMEN’S HOUSES. IN THE FOREGROUND CRANES AND WAREHOUSES SCAFFOLDING AND GASOMETERS LINE THE BANKS WITH A SKELETON ARCHITECTURE.

WHEN SUDDENLY AFTER ACRES AND ACRES OF THIS DESOLATION ONE FLOATS PAST AN OLD STONE HOUSE STANDING IN A REAL FIELD WITH REAL TREES GROWING IN CLUMPS THE SIGHT IS DISCONCERTING. CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS EARTH THAT THERE ONCE WERE FIELDS AND CROPS BENEATH THIS DESOLATION AND DISORDER? TREES AND FIELDS SEEM TO SURVIVE INCONGRUOUSLY LIKE A SAMPLE OF ANOTHER CIVILIZATION AMONG THE WALL-PAPER FACTORIES AND SOAP FACTORIES THAT HAVE STAMPED OUT OLD LAWNS AND TERRACES. STILL MORE INCONGRUOUSLY ONE PASSES AN OLD GREY COUNTRY CHURCH WHICH STILL RINGS ITS BELLS AND KEEPS ITS CHURCHYARD GREEN AS IF COUNTRY PEOPLE WERE STILL COMING ACROSS THE FIELDS TO SERVICE. FURTHER DOWN AN INN WITH SWELLING BOW WINDOWS STILL WEARS A STRANGE AIR OF DISSIPATION AND PLEASURE MAKING. IN THE MIDDLE YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WAS A FAVOURITE RESORT OF PLEASURE MAKERS AND FIGURED IN SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS DIVORCE CASES OF THE TIME. NOW PLEASURE HAS GONE AND LABOUR HAS COME; AND IT STANDS DERELICT LIKE SOME BEAUTY IN HER MIDNIGHT FINERY LOOKING OUT OVER MUD FLATS AND CANDLE WORKS WHILE MALODOROUS MOUNDS OF EARTH UPON WHICH TRUCKS ARE PERPETUALLY TIPPING FRESH HEAPS HAVE ENTIRELY CONSUMED THE FIELDS WHERE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO LOVERS WANDERED AND PICKED VIOLETS.

AS WE GO ON STEAMING UP THE RIVER TO LONDON WE MEET ITS REFUSE COMING DOWN. BARGES HEAPED WITH OLD BUCKETS RAZOR BLADES FISH TAILS NEWSPAPERS AND ASHES—WHATEVER WE LEAVE ON OUR PLATES AND THROW INTO OUR DUSTBINS—ARE DISCHARGING THEIR CARGOES UPON THE MOST DESOLATE LAND IN THE WORLD. THE LONG MOUNDS HAVE BEEN FUMING AND SMOKING AND HARBOURING INNUMERABLE RATS AND GROWING A RANK COARSE GRASS AND GIVING OFF A GRITTY ACRID AIR FOR FIFTY YEARS. THE DUMPS GET HIGHER AND HIGHER AND THICKER AND THICKER THEIR SIDES MORE PRECIPITOUS WITH TIN CANS THEIR PINNACLES MORE ANGULAR WITH ASHES YEAR BY YEAR. BUT THEN PAST ALL THIS SORDIDITY SWEEPS INDIFFERENTLY A GREAT LINER BOUND FOR INDIA. SHE TAKES HER WAY THROUGH RUBBISH BARGES AND SEWAGE BARGES AND DREDGERS OUT TO SEA. A LITTLE FURTHER ON THE LEFT HAND WE ARE SUDDENLY SURPRISED—THE SIGHT UPSETS ALL OUR PROPORTIONS ONCE MORE–BY WHAT APPEAR TO BE THE STATELIEST BUILDINGS EVER RAISED BY THE HAND OF MAN. GREENWICH HOSPITAL* WITH ALL ITS COLUMNS AND DOMES COMES DOWN IN PERFECT SYMMETRY TO THE WATER’S EDGE AND MAKES THE RIVER AGAIN A STATELY WATERWAY WHERE THE NOBILITY OF ENGLAND ONCE WALKED AT THEIR EASE ON GREEN LAWNS OR DESCENDED STONE STEPS TO THEIR PLEASURE BARGES. AS WE COME CLOSER TO THE TOWER BRIDGE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CITY BEGINS TO ASSERT ITSELF. THE BUILDINGS THICKEN AND HEAP THEMSELVES HIGHER. THE SKY SEEMS LADEN WITH HEAVIER PURPLER CLOUDS. DOMES SWELL; CHURCH SPIRES WHITE WITH AGE MINGLE WITH THE TAPERING PENCIL-SHAPED CHIMNEYS OF FACTORIES. ONE HEARS THE ROAR AND THE RESONANCE OF LONDON ITSELF. HERE AT LAST WE HAVE LANDED AT THAT THICK AND FORMIDABLE CIRCLE OF ANCIENT STONE WHERE SO MANY DRUMS HAVE BEATEN AND HEADS HAVE FALLEN THE TOWER OF LONDON ITSELF. THIS IS THE KNOT THE CLUE THE HUB OF ALL THOSE SCATTERED MILES OF SKELETON DESOLATION AND ANT-LIKE ACTIVITY. HERE GROWLS AND GRUMBLES THAT ROUGH CITY SONG THAT HAS CALLED THE SHIPS FROM THE SEA AND BROUGHT THEM TO LIE CAPTIVE BENEATH ITS WAREHOUSES.

NOW FROM THE DOCK SIDE WE LOOK DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THE SHIP THAT HAS BEEN LURED FROM ITS VOYAGING AND TETHERED TO THE DRY LAND. THE PASSENGERS AND THEIR BAGS HAVE DISAPPEARED; THE SAILORS HAVE GONE TOO. INDEFATIGABLE CRANES ARE NOW AT WORK DIPPING AND SWINGING SWINGING AND DIPPING. BARRELS SACKS CRATES ARE BEING PICKED UP OUT OF THE HOLD AND SWUNG REGULARLY ON SHORE. RHYTHMICALLY DEXTEROUSLY WITH AN ORDER THAT HAS SOME AESTHETIC DELIGHT IN IT BARREL IS LAID BY BARREL CASE BY CASE CASK BY CASK ONE BEHIND ANOTHER ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER ONE BESIDE ANOTHER IN ENDLESS ARRAY DOWN THE AISLES AND ARCADES OF THE IMMENSE LOW-CEILED ENTIRELY PLAIN AND UNORNAMENTED WAREHOUSES. TIMBER IRON GRAIN WINE SUGAR PAPER TALLOW FRUIT—WHATEVER THE SHIP HAS GATHERED FROM THE PLAINS FROM THE FORESTS FROM THE PASTURES OF THE WHOLE WORLD IS HERE LIFTED FROM ITS HOLD AND SET IN ITS RIGHT PLACE. A THOUSAND SHIPS WITH A THOUSAND CARGOES ARE BEING UNLADEN EVERY WEEK. AND NOT ONLY IS EACH PACKAGE OF THIS VAST AND VARIED MERCHANDISE PICKED UP AND SET DOWN ACCURATELY BUT EACH IS WEIGHED AND OPENED SAMPLED AND RECORDED AND AGAIN STITCHED UP AND LAID IN ITS PLACE WITHOUT HASTE OR WASTE OR HURRY OR CONFUSION BY A VERY FEW MEN IN SHIRTSLEEVES WHO WORKING WITH THE UTMOST ORGANIZATION IN THE COMMON INTEREST—FOR BUYERS WILL TAKE THEIR WORD AND ABIDE BY THEIR DECISION—ARE YET ABLE TO PAUSE IN THEIR WORK AND SAY TO THE CASUAL VISITOR ‘WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT SORT OF THING WE SOMETIMES FIND IN SACKS OF CINNAMON? LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!’

A SNAKE A SCORPION A BEETLE A LUMP OF AMBER THE DISEASED TOOTH OF AN ELEPHANT A BASIN OF QUICKSILVER—THESE ARE SOME OF THE RARITIES AND ODDITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PICKED OUT OF THIS CAST MERCHANDISE AND STOOD ON A TABLE. BUT WITH THIS ONE CONCESSION TO CURIOSITY THE TEMPER OF THE DOCKS IS SEVERELY UTILITARIAN. ODDITIES BEAUTIES RARITIES MAY OCCUR BUT IF SO THEY ARE INSTANTLY TESTED FOR THEIR MERCANTILE VALUE. LAID ON THE FLOOR AMONG THE CIRCLES OF ELEPHANT TUSKS IS A HEAP OF LARGER AND BROWNER TUSKS THAN THE REST. BROWN THEY WELL MAY BE FOR THESE ARE THE TUSKS OF MAMMOTHS THAT HAVE LAIN FROZEN IN SIBERIAN ICE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS; BUT FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS ARE SUSPECT IN THE EYES OF THE IVORY EXPERT. MAMMOTH IVORY TENDS TO WARP; YOU CANNOT EXTRACT BILLIARD BALLS FROM MAMMOTHS BUT ONLY UMBRELLA HANDLES AND THE BACKS OF THE CHEAPER KIND OF HAND-GLASS. THUS IF YOU BUY AN UMBRELLA OR A LOOKING-GLASS NOT OF THE FINEST QUALITY IT IS LIKELY THAT YOU ARE BUYING THE TUSK OF A BRUTE THAT ROAMED THROUGH ASIAN FORESTS BEFORE ENGLAND WAS AN ISLAND.

ONE TUSK MAKES A BILLIARD BALL ANOTHER SERVES FOR A SHOE-HORN—EVERY COMMODITY IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN EXAMINED AND GRADED ACCORDING TO ITS USE AND VALUE. TRADE IS INGENIOUS AND INDEFATIGABLE BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF IMAGINATION. NONE OF ALL THE MULTITUDINOUS PRODUCTS AND WASTE PRODUCTS OF THE EARTH BUT HAS BEEN TESTED AND FOUND SOME POSSIBLE USE FOR. THE BALES OF WOOL THAT ARE BEING SWUNG FROM THE HOLD OF AN AUSTRALIAN SHIP ARE GIRT TO SAVE SPACE WITH IRON HOOPS; BUT THE HOOPS DO NOT LITTER THE FLOOR; THEY ARE SENT TO GERMANY AND MADE INTO SAFETY RAZORS. THE WOOL ITSELF EXUDES A COARSE GREASINESS. THIS GREASE WHICH IS HARMFUL TO BLANKETS SERVES WHEN EXTRACTED TO MAKE FACE CREAM. EVEN THE BURRS THAT STICK IN THE WOOL OF CERTAIN BREEDS OF SHEEP HAVE THEIR USE FOR THEY PROVE THAT THE SHEEP UNDOUBTEDLY WERE FED ON CERTAIN RICH PASTURES. NOT A BURR NOT A TUFT OF WOOL NOT AN IRON HOOP IS UNACCOUNTED FOR. AND THE APTNESS OF EVERYTHING TO ITS PURPOSE THE FORETHOUGHT AND READINESS WHICH HAVE PROVIDED FOR EVERY PROCESS COME AS IF BY THE BACK DOOR TO PROVIDE THAT ELEMENT OF BEAUTY WHICH NOBODY IN THE DOCKS HAS EVER GIVEN HALF A SECOND OF THOUGHT TO. THE WAREHOUSE IS PERFECTLY FIT TO BE A WAREHOUSE; THE CRANE TO BE A CRANE. HENCE BEAUTY BEGINS TO STEAL IN. THE CRANES DIP AND SWING AND THERE IS RHYTHM IN THEIR REGULARITY. THE WAREHOUSE WALLS ARE OPEN WIDE TO ADMIT SACKS AND BARRELS; BUT THROUGH THEM ONE SEES ALL THE ROOFS OF LONDON ITS MASTS AND SPIRES AND THE UNCONSCIOUS VIGOROUS MOVEMENTS OF MEN LIFTING AND UNLOADING. BECAUSE BARRELS OF WINE REQUIRE TO BE LAID ON THEIR SIDES IN COOL VAULTS ALL THE MYSTERY OF DIM LIGHTS ALL THE BEAUTY OF LOW ARCHES IS THROWN IN AS AN EXTRA.

THE WINE VAULTS PRESENT A SCENE OF EXTRAORDINARY SOLEMNITY. WAVING LONG BLADES OF WOOD TO WHICH LAMPS HAVE BEEN FIXED WE PEER ABOUT IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE A VAST CATHEDRAL AT CASK AFTER CASK LYING IN A DIM SACERDOTAL ATMOSPHERE GRAVELY MATURING SLOWLY RIPENING. WE MIGHT BE PRIESTS WORSHIPPING IN THE TEMPLE OF SOME SILENT RELIGION AND NOT MERELY WINE TASTERS AND CUSTOMS OFFICERS AS WE WANDER WAVING OUR LAMPS UP THIS AISLE DOWN THAT. A YELLOW CAT PRECEDES US; OTHERWISE THE VAULTS ARE EMPTY OF ALL HUMAN LIFE. HERE SIDE BY SIDE THE OBJECTS OF OUR WORSHIP LIE SWOLLEN WITH SWEET LIQUOR SPOUTING RED WINE IF TAPPED. A WINY SWEETNESS FILLS THE VAULTS LIKE INCENSE. HERE AND THERE A GAS JET FLARES NOT INDEED TO GIVE LIGHT OR BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY OF THE GREEN AND GREY ARCHES WHICH IT CALLS UP IN ENDLESS PROCESSION DOWN AVENUE AFTER AVENUE BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE SO MUCH HEAT IS REQUIRED TO MELLOW THE WINE. USE PRODUCES BEAUTY AS A BY-PRODUCT. FROM THE LOW ARCHES A WHITE COTTON-WOOL-LIKE GROWTH DEPENDS. IT IS A FUNGUS BUT WHETHER LOVELY OR LOATHSOME MATTERS NOT; IT IS WELCOME BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT THE AIR POSSESSES THE RIGHT DEGREE OF DAMPNESS FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PRECIOUS FLUID.

EVEN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS ADAPTED ITSELF TO THE NEEDS OF COMMERCE. WORDS HAVE FORMED ROUND OBJECTS AND TAKEN THEIR EXACT OUTLINE. ONE MAY LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY IN VAIN FOR THE WAREHOUSE MEANING OF ‘VALINCH’ ‘SHIVE’ ‘SHIRT’ AND ‘FLOGGER’ BUT IN THE WAREHOUSE THEY HAVE FORMED NATURALLY ON THE TIP OF THE TONGUE. SO TOO THE LIGHT STROKE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BARREL WHICH MAKES THE BUNG START HAS BEEN ARRIVED AT BY YEARS OF TRIAL AND EXPERIMENT. IT IS THE QUICKEST THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF ACTIONS. DEXTERITY CAN GO NO FURTHER.

THE ONLY THING ONE COMES TO FEEL THAT CAN CHANGE THE ROUTINE OF THE DOCKS IS A CHANGE IN OURSELVES. SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THAT WE GAVE UP DRINKING CLARET OR TOOK TO USING RUBBER INSTEAD OF WOOL FOR OUR BLANKETS THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION WOULD ROCK AND REEL AND SEEK ABOUT TO ADAPT ITSELF AFRESH. IT IS WE—OUR TASTES OUR FASHIONS OUR NEEDS—THAT MAKE THE CRANES DIP AND SWING THAT CALL THE SHIPS FROM THE SEA. OUR BODY IS THEIR MASTER. WE DEMAND SHOES FURS BAGS STOVES OIL RICE PUDDINGS CANDLES; AND THEY ARE BROUGHT US. TRADE WATCHES US ANXIOUSLY TO SEE WHAT NEW DESIRES ARE BEGINNING TO GROW IN US WHAT NEW DISLIKES. ONE FEELS AN IMPORTANT A COMPLEX A NECESSARY ANIMAL AS ONE STANDS ON THE QUAYSIDE WATCHING THE CRANES HOIST THIS BARREL THAT CRATE THAT OTHER BALE FROM THE HOLDS OF THE SHIPS THAT HAVE COME TO ANCHOR. BECAUSE ONE CHOOSES TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE ALL THOSE BARRELS OF VIRGINIAN TOBACCO ARE SWUNG ON SHORE. FLOCKS UPON FLOCKS OF AUSTRALIAN SHEEP HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE SHEARS BECAUSE WE DEMAND WOOLLEN OVERCOATS IN WINTER. AS FOR THE UMBRELLA THAT WE SWING IDLY TO AND FRO A MAMMOTH WHO ROARED THROUGH THE SWAMPS FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO HAS YIELDED UP ITS TUSK TO MAKE THE HANDLE.

MEANWHILE THE SHIP FLYING THE BLUE PETER* MOVES SLOWLY OUT OF THE DOCK; IT HAS TURNED ITS BOWS TO INDIA OR AUSTRALIA ONCE MORE. BUT IN THE PORT OF LONDON LORRIES JOSTLE EACH OTHER IN THE LITTLE STREET THAT LEADS FROM THE DOCK—FOR THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT SALE AND THE CART HORSES ARE STRUGGLING AND STRIVING TO DISTRIBUTE THE WOOL OVER ENGLAND.

OXFORD STREET TIDE
DOWN IN THE DOCKS ONE SEES THINGS IN THEIR CRUDITY THEIR BULK THEIR ENORMITY. HERE IN OXFORD STREET THEY HAVE BEEN REFINED AND TRANSFORMED. THE HUGE BARRELS OF DAMP TOBACCO HAVE BEEN ROLLED INTO INNUMERABLE NEAT CIGARETTES LAID IN SILVER PAPER. THE CORPULENT BALES OF WOOL HAVE BEEN SPUN INTO THIN VESTS AND SOFT STOCKINGS. THE GREASE OF SHEEP’S THICK WOOL HAS BECOME SCENTED CREAM FOR DELICATE SKINS. AND THOSE WHO BUY AND THOSE WHO SELL HAVE SUFFERED THE SAME CITY CHANGE. TRIPPING MINCING IN BLACK COATS IN SATIN DRESSES THE HUMAN FORM HAS ADAPTED ITSELF NO LESS THAN THE ANIMAL PRODUCT. INSTEAD OF HAULING AND HEAVING IT DEFTLY OPENS DRAWERS ROLLS OUT SILK ON COUNTERS MEASURES AND SNIPS WITH YARD STICKS AND SCISSORS.

OXFORD STREET IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING IS NOT LONDON’S MOST DISTINGUISHED THOROUGHFARE. MORALISTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN AT THOSE WHO BUY THERE AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE DANDIES. FASHION HAS SECRET CRANNIES OFF HANOVER SQUARE ROUND ABOUT BOND STREET TO WHICH IT WITHDRAWS DISCREETLY TO PERFORM ITS MORE SUBLIME RITES. IN OXFORD STREET THERE ARE TOO MANY BARGAINS TOO MANY SALES TOO MANY GOODS MARKED DOWN TO ONE AND ELEVEN THREE THAT ONLY LAST WEEK COST TWO AND SIX. THE BUYING AND SELLING IS TOO BLATANT AND RAUCOUS. BUT AS ONE SAUNTERS TOWARDS THE SUNSET—AND WHAT WITH ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND MOUNDS OF SILK AND GLEAMING OMNIBUSES A PERPETUAL SUNSET SEEMS TO BROOD OVER THE MARBLE ARCH*—THE GARISHNESS AND GAUDINESS OF THE GREAT ROLLING RIBBON OF OXFORD STREET HAS ITS FASCINATION. IT IS LIKE THE PEBBLY BED OF A RIVER WHOSE STONES ARE FOREVER WASHED BY A BRIGHT STREAM. EVERYTHING GLITTERS AND TWINKLES. THE FIRST SPRING DAY BRINGS OUT BARROWS FRILLED WITH TULIPS VIOLETS DAFFODILS IN BRILLIANT LAYERS. THE FRAIL VESSELS EDDY VAGUELY ACROSS THE STREAM OF THE TRAFFIC. AT ONE CORNER SEEDY MAGICIANS ARE MAKING SLIPS OF COLOURED PAPER EXPAND IN MAGIC TUMBLERS INTO BRISTLING FORESTS OF SPLENDIDLY TINTED FLORA—A SUBAQUEOUS FLOWER GARDEN. AT ANOTHER TORTOISES REPOSE ON LITTERS OF GRASS. THE SLOWEST AND MOST CONTEMPLATIVE OF CREATURES DISPLAY THEIR MILD ACTIVITIES ON A FOOT OR TWO OF PAVEMENT JEALOUSLY GUARDED FROM PASSING FEET. ONE INFERS THAT THE DESIRE OF MAN FOR THE TORTOISE LIKE THE DESIRE OF THE MOTH FOR THE STAR IS A CONSTANT ELEMENT IN HUMAN NATURE. NEVERTHELESS TO SEE A WOMAN STOP AND ADD A TORTOISE TO HER STRING OF PARCELS IS PERHAPS THE RAREST SIGHT THAT HUMAN EYES CAN LOOK UPON.

TAKING ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT—THE AUCTIONS THE BARROWS THE CHEAPNESS THE GLITTER—IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CHARACTER OF OXFORD STREET IS REFINED. IT IS A BREEDING GROUND A FORCING HOUSE OF SENSATION. THE PAVEMENT SEEMS TO SPROUT HORRID TRAGEDIES; THE DIVORCES OF ACTRESSES THE SUICIDES OF MILLIONAIRES OCCUR HERE WITH A FREQUENCY THAT IS UNKNOWN IN THE MORE AUSTERE PAVEMENTS OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. NEWS CHANGES QUICKER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF LONDON. THE PRESS OF PEOPLE PASSING SEEMS TO LICK THE INK OFF THE PLACARDS AND TO CONSUME MORE OF THEM AND TO DEMAND FRESH SUPPLIES OF LATER EDITIONS FASTER THAN ELSEWHERE. THE MIND BECOMES A GLUTINOUS SLAB THAT TAKES IMPRESSIONS AND OXFORD STREET ROLLS OFF UPON IT A PERPETUAL RIBBON OF CHANGING SIGHTS SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT. PARCELS SLAP AND HIT; MOTOR OMNIBUSES GRAZE THE KERB; THE BLARE OF A WHOLE BRASS BAND IN FULL TONGUE DWINDLES TO A THIN REED OF SOUND. BUSES VANS CARS BARROWS STREAM PAST LIKE THE FRAGMENTS OF A PICTURE PUZZLE; A WHITE ARM RISES; THE PUZZLE RUNS THICK COAGULATES STOPS; THE WHITE ARM SINKS AND AWAY IT STREAMS AGAIN STREAKED TWISTED HIGGLEDY-PIGGLEDY IN PERPETUAL RACE AND DISORDER. THE PUZZLE NEVER FITS ITSELF TOGETHER HOWEVER LONG WE LOOK.

ON THE BANKS OF THIS RIVER OF TURNING WHEELS OUR MODERN ARISTOCRATS HAVE BUILT PALACES JUST AS IN ANCIENT DAYS THE DUKES OF SOMERSET AND NORTHUMBERLAND THE EARLS OF DORSET AND SALISBURY LINED THE STRAND WITH THEIR STATELY MANSIONS. THE DIFFERENT HOUSES OF THE GREAT FIRMS TESTIFY TO THE COURAGE INITIATIVE THE AUDACITY OF THEIR CREATORS MUCH AS THE GREAT HOUSES OF CAVENDISH AND PERCY* TESTIFY TO SUCH QUALITIES IN SOME FAR-AWAY SHIRE. FROM THE LOINS OF OUR MERCHANTS WILL SPRING THE CAVENDISHES AND THE PERCYS OF THE FUTURE. INDEED THE GREAT LORDS OF OXFORD STREET ARE AS MAGNANIMOUS AS ANY DUKE OR EARL WHO SCATTERED GOLD OR DOLED OUT LOAVES TO THE POOR AT HIS GATES. ONLY THEIR LARGESSE TAKES A DIFFERENT FORM. IT TAKES THE FORM OF EXCITEMENT OF DISPLAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OF WINDOWS LIT UP BY NIGHT OF BANNERS FLAUNTING BY DAY. THEY GIVE US THE LATEST NEWS FOR NOTHING. MUSIC STREAMS FROM THEIR BANQUETING ROOMS FREE. YOU NEED NOT SPEND MORE THAN ONE AND ELEVEN THREE TO ENJOY ALL THE SHELTER THAT HIGH AND AIRY HALLS PROVIDE; AND THE SOFT PILE OF CARPETS AND THE LUXURY OF LIFTS AND THE GLOW OF FABRICS AND CARPETS AND SILVER. PERCY AND CAVENDISH COULD GIVE NO MORE. THESE GIFTS OF COURSE HAVE AN OBJECT—TO ENTICE THE SHILLING AND ELEVEN PENNIES AS FREELY FROM OUR POCKETS AS POSSIBLE; BUT THE PERCYS AND THE CAVENDISHES WERE NOT MUNIFICENT EITHER WITHOUT HOPE OF SOME RETURN WHETHER IT WAS A DEDICATION FROM A POET OR A VOTE FROM A FARMER. AND BOTH THE OLD LORDS AND THE NEW ADDED CONSIDERABLY TO THE DECORATION AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HUMAN LIFE.

BUT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THESE OXFORD STREET PALACES ARE RATHER FLIMSY ABODES—PERCHING-GROUNDS RATHER THAN DWELLING-PLACES. ONE IS CONSCIOUS THAT ONE IS WALKING ON A STRIP OF WOOD LAID UPON STEEL GIRDERS AND THAT THE OUTER WALL FOR ALL ITS FLORID STONE ORNAMENTATION IS ONLY THICK ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE FORCE OF THE WIND. A VIGOROUS PROD WITH AN UMBRELLA POINT MIGHT WELL INFLICT IRREPARABLE DAMAGE UPON THE FABRIC. MANY A COUNTRY COTTAGE BUILT TO HOUSE FARMER OR MILLER WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS ON THE THRONE WILL LIVE TO SEE THESE PALACES FALL INTO THE DUST. THE OLD COTTAGE WALLS WITH THEIR OAK BEAMS AND THEIR LAYERS OF HONEST BRICK SOUNDLY CEMENTED TOGETHER STILL PUT UP A STOUT RESISTANCE TO THE DRILLS AND BORES THAT ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE THE MODERN BLESSING OF ELECTRICITY. BUT ANY DAY OF THE WEEK ONE MAY SEE OXFORD STREET VANISHING AT THE TAP OF A WORKMAN’S PICK AS HE STANDS PERILOUSLY BALANCED ON A DUSTY PINNACLE KNOCKING DOWN WALLS AND FAÇADES AS LIGHTLY AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF YELLOW CARDBOARD AND SUGAR ICING.

AND AGAIN THE MORALISTS POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN. FOR SUCH THINNESS SUCH PAPERY STONE AND POWDERY BRICK REFLECT THEY SAY THE LEVITY THE OSTENTATION THE HASTE AND IRRESPONSIBILITY OF OUR AGE. YET PERHAPS THEY ARE AS MUCH OUT IN THEIR SCORN AS WE SHOULD BE IF WE ASKED OF THE LILY THAT IT SHOULD BE CAST IN BRONZE OR OF THE DAISY THAT IT SHOULD HAVE PETALS OF IMPERISHABLE ENAMEL. THE CHARM OF MODERN LONDON IS THAT IT IS NOT BUILT TO LAST; IT IS BUILT TO PASS. ITS GLASSINESS ITS TRANSPARENCY ITS SURGING WAVES OF COLOURED PLASTER GIVE A DIFFERENT PLEASURE AND ACHIEVE A DIFFERENT END FROM THAT WHICH WAS DESIRED AND ATTEMPTED BY THE OLD BUILDERS AND THEIR PATRONS THE NOBILITY OF ENGLAND. THEIR PRIDE REQUIRED THE ILLUSION OF PERMANENCE. OURS ON THE CONTRARY SEEMS TO DELIGHT IN PROVING THAT WE CAN MAKE STONE AND BRICK AS TRANSITORY AS OUR OWN DESIRES. WE DO NOT BUILD FOR OUR DESCENDANTS WHO MAY LIVE UP IN THE CLOUDS OR DOWN IN THE EARTH BUT FOR OURSELVES AND OUR OWN NEEDS. WE KNOCK DOWN AND REBUILD AS WE EXPECT TO BE KNOCKED DOWN AND REBUILT. IT IS AN IMPULSE THAT MAKES FOR CREATION AND FERTILITY. DISCOVERY IS STIMULATED AND INVENTION ON THE ALERT.

THE PALACES OF OXFORD STREET IGNORE WHAT SEEMED GOOD TO THE GREEKS TO THE ELIZABETHAN TO THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOBLEMAN; THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY CONSCIOUS THAT UNLESS THEY CAN DEVISE AN ARCHITECTURE THAT SHOWS OFF THE DRESSING-CASE THE PARIS FROCK THE CHEAP STOCKINGS AND THE JAR OF BATH SALTS TO PERFECTION THEIR PALACES THEIR MANSIONS AND MOTOR CARS AND THE LITTLE VILLAS OUT AT CROYDON AND SURBITON WHERE THEIR SHOP ASSISTANTS LIVE NOT SO BADLY AFTER ALL WITH A GRAMOPHONE AND WIRELESS AND MONEY TO SPEND AT THE MOVIES—ALL THIS WILL BE SWEPT TO RUIN. HENCE THEY STRETCH STONE FANTASTICALLY; CRUSH TOGETHER IN ONE WILD CONFUSION THE STYLES OF GREECE EGYPT ITALY AMERICA; AND BOLDLY ATTEMPT AN AIR OF LAVISHNESS OPULENCE IN THEIR EFFORT TO PERSUADE THE MULTITUDE THAT HERE UNENDING BEAUTY EVER FRESH EVER NEW VERY CHEAP AND WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERYBODY BUBBLES UP EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK FROM AN INEXHAUSTIBLE WELL. THE MERE THOUGHT OF AGE OF SOLIDITY OF LASTING FOR EVER IS ABHORRENT TO OXFORD STREET.

THEREFORE IF THE MORALIST CHOOSES TO TAKE HIS AFTERNOON WALK ALONG THIS PARTICULAR THOROUGHFARE HE MUST TUNE HIS STRAIN SO THAT IT RECEIVES INTO IT SOME QUEER INCONGRUOUS VOICES. ABOVE THE RACKET OF VAN AND OMNIBUS WE CAN HEAR THEM CRYING. GOD KNOWS SAYS THE MAN WHO SELLS TORTOISES THAT MY ARM ACHES; MY CHANCE OF SELLING A TORTOISE IS SMALL; BUT COURAGE! THERE MAY COME ALONG A BUYER; MY BED TONIGHT DEPENDS ON IT; SO ON I MUST GO AS SLOWLY AS THE POLICE ALLOW WHEELING TORTOISES DOWN OXFORD STREET FROM DAWN TILL DUSK. TRUE SAYS THE GREAT MERCHANT I AM NOT THINKING OF EDUCATING THE MASS TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF AESTHETIC SENSIBILITY. IT TAXES ALL MY WITS TO THINK HOW I CAN DISPLAY MY GOODS WITH THE MINIMUM OF WASTE AND THE MAXIMUM OF EFFECTIVENESS. GREEN DRAGONS ON THE TOP OF CORINTHIAN COLUMNS MAY HELP;* LET US TRY. I GRANT SAYS THE MIDDLE-CLASS WOMAN THAT I LINGER AND LOOK AND BARTER AND CHEAPEN AND TURN OVER BASKET AFTER BASKET OF REMNANTS HOUR BY HOUR. MY EYES GLISTEN UNSEEMLILY I KNOW AND I GRAB AND POUNCE WITH DISGUSTING GREED. BUT MY HUSBAND IS A SMALL CLERK IN A BANK; I HAVE ONLY FIFTEEN POUNDS A YEAR TO DRESS ON; SO HERE I COME TO LINGER AND LOITER AND LOOK IF I CAN AS WELL DRESSED AS MY NEIGHBOURS. I AM A THIEF SAYS A WOMAN OF THAT PERSUASION AND A LADY OF EASY VIRTUE INTO THE BARGAIN. BUT IT TAKES A GOOD DEAL OF PLUCK TO SNATCH A BAG FROM A COUNTER WHEN A CUSTOMER IS NOT LOOKING; AND IT MAY CONTAIN ONLY SPECTACLES AND OLD BUS TICKETS AFTER ALL. SO HERE GOES!

A THOUSAND SUCH VOICES ARE ALWAYS CRYING ALOUD IN OXFORD STREET. ALL ARE TENSE ALL ARE REAL ALL ARE URGED OUT OF THEIR SPEAKERS BY THE PRESSURE OF MAKING A LIVING FINDING A BED SOMEHOW KEEPING AFLOAT ON THE BOUNDING CARELESS REMORSELESS TIDE OF THE STREET. AND EVEN A MORALIST WHO IS ONE MUST SUPPOSE SINCE HE CAN SPEND THE AFTERNOON DREAMING A MAN WITH A BALANCE IN THE BANK—EVEN A MORALIST MUST ALLOW THAT THIS GAUDY BUSTLING VULGAR STREET REMINDS US THAT LIFE IS A STRUGGLE; THAT ALL BUILDING IS PERISHABLE; THAT ALL DISPLAY IS VANITY; FROM WHICH WE MAY CONCLUDE—BUT UNTIL SOME ADROIT SHOPKEEPER HAS CAUGHT ON TO THE IDEA AND OPENED CELLS FOR SOLITARY THINKERS HUNG WITH GREEN PLUSH AND PROVIDED WITH AUTOMATIC GLOW-WORMS AND A SPRINKLING OF GENUINE DEATH’S-HEAD MOTHS TO INDUCE THOUGHT AND REFLECTION IT IS VAIN TO TRY TO COME TO A CONCLUSION IN OXFORD STREET.

EVENING OVER SUSSEX: REFLECTIONS IN A MOTOR CAR
EVENING IS KIND TO SUSSEX FOR SUSSEX IS NO LONGER YOUNG AND SHE IS GRATEFUL FOR THE VEIL OF EVENING AS AN ELDERLY WOMAN IS GLAD WHEN A SHADE IS DRAWN OVER A LAMP AND ONLY THE OUTLINE OF HER FACE REMAINS. THE OUTLINE OF SUSSEX IS STILL VERY FINE. THE CLIFFS STAND OUT TO SEA ONE BEHIND ANOTHER. ALL EASTBOURNE ALL BEXHILL ALL ST LEONARDS* THEIR PARADES AND THEIR LODGING HOUSES THEIR BEAD SHOPS AND THEIR SWEET SHOPS AND THEIR PLACARDS AND THEIR INVALIDS AND CHARABANCS ARE ALL OBLITERATED. WHAT REMAINS IS WHAT THERE WAS WHEN WILLIAM CAME OVER FROM FRANCE TEN CENTURIES AGO:* A LINE OF CLIFFS RUNNING OUT TO SEA. ALSO THE FIELDS ARE REDEEMED. THE FRECKLE OF RED VILLAS ON THE COAST IS WASHED OVER BY A THIN LUCID LAKE OF BROWN AIR IN WHICH THEY AND THEIR REDNESS ARE DROWNED. IT WAS STILL TOO EARLY FOR LAMPS; AND TOO EARLY FOR STARS.

BUT I THOUGHT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME SEDIMENT OF IRRITATION WHEN THE MOMENT IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT IS NOW. THE PSYCHOLOGISTS MUST EXPLAIN; ONE LOOKS UP ONE IS OVERCOME BY BEAUTY EXTRAVAGANTLY GREATER THAN ONE COULD EXPECT—THERE ARE NOW PINK CLOUDS OVER BATTLE;* THE FIELDS ARE MOTTLED MARBLED—ONE’S PERCEPTIONS BLOW OUT RAPIDLY LIKE AIR BALLS* EXPANDED BY SOME RUSH OF AIR AND THEN WHEN ALL SEEMS BLOWN TO ITS FULLEST AND TAUTEST WITH BEAUTY AND BEAUTY AND BEAUTY A PIN PRICKS; IT COLLAPSES. BUT WHAT IS THE PIN? SO FAR AS I COULD TELL THE PIN HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ONE’S OWN IMPOTENCY. I CANNOT HOLD THIS—I CANNOT EXPRESS THIS—I AM OVERCOME BY IT—I AM MASTERED. SOMEWHERE IN THAT REGION ONE’S DISCONTENT LAY; AND IT WAS ALLIED WITH THE IDEA THAT ONE’S NATURE DEMANDS MASTERY OVER ALL THAT IT RECEIVES; AND MASTERY HERE MEANT THE POWER TO CONVEY WHAT ONE SAW NOW OVER SUSSEX SO THAT ANOTHER PERSON COULD SHARE IT. AND FURTHER THERE WAS ANOTHER PRICK OF THE PIN: ONE WAS WASTING ONE’S CHANCE; FOR BEAUTY SPREAD AT ONE’S RIGHT HAND AT ONE’S LEFT; AT ONE’S BACK TOO; IT WAS ESCAPING ALL THE TIME; ONE COULD ONLY OFFER A THIMBLE TO A TORRENT THAT COULD FILL BATHS LAKES.

BUT RELINQUISH I SAID (IT IS WELL KNOWN HOW IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE THE SELF SPLITS UP AND ONE SELF IS EAGER AND DISSATISFIED AND THE OTHER STERN AND PHILOSOPHICAL) RELINQUISH THESE IMPOSSIBLE ASPIRATIONS; BE CONTENT WITH THE VIEW IN FRONT OF US AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT IS BEST TO SIT AND SOAK; TO BE PASSIVE; TO ACCEPT; AND DO NOT BOTHER BECAUSE NATURE HAS GIVEN YOU SIX LITTLE POCKET KNIVES WITH WHICH TO CUT UP THE BODY OF A WHALE.

WHILE THESE TWO SELVES THEN HELD A COLLOQUY ABOUT THE WISE COURSE TO ADOPT IN THE PRESENCE OF BEAUTY I (A THIRD PARTY NOW DECLARED ITSELF) SAID TO MYSELF HOW HAPPY THEY WERE TO ENJOY SO SIMPLE AN OCCUPATION. THERE THEY SAT AS THE CAR SPED ALONG NOTICING EVERYTHING: A HAY STACK; A RUST RED ROOF; A POND; AN OLD MAN COMING HOME WITH HIS SACK ON HIS BACK; THERE THEY SAT MATCHING EVERY COLOUR IN THE SKY AND EARTH FROM THEIR COLOUR BOX RIGGING UP LITTLE MODELS OF SUSSEX BARNS AND FARMHOUSES IN THE RED LIGHT THAT WOULD SERVE IN THE JANUARY GLOOM. BUT I BEING SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT SAT ALOOF AND MELANCHOLY. WHILE THEY ARE THUS BUSIED I SAID TO MYSELF: GONE GONE; OVER OVER; PAST AND DONE WITH PAST AND DONE WITH. I FEEL LIFE LEFT BEHIND EVEN AS THE ROAD IS LEFT BEHIND. WE HAVE BEEN OVER THAT STRETCH AND ARE ALREADY FORGOTTEN. THERE WINDOWS WERE LIT BY OUR LAMPS FOR A SECOND; THE LIGHT IS OUT NOW. OTHERS COME BEHIND US.

THEN SUDDENLY A FOURTH SELF (A SELF WHICH LIES IN AMBUSH APPARENTLY DORMANT AND JUMPS UPON ONE UNAWARES. ITS REMARKS ARE OFTEN ENTIRELY DISCONNECTED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BUT MUST BE ATTENDED TO BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY ABRUPTNESS) SAID: ‘LOOK AT THAT.’ IT WAS A LIGHT; BRILLIANT FREAKISH; INEXPLICABLE. FOR A SECOND I WAS UNABLE TO NAME IT. ‘A STAR’; AND FOR THAT SECOND IT HELD ITS ODD FLICKER OF UNEXPECTEDNESS AND DANCED AND BEAMED. ‘I TAKE YOUR MEANING’ I SAID. ‘YOU ERRATIC AND IMPULSIVE SELF THAT YOU ARE FEEL THAT THE LIGHT OVER THE DOWNS THERE EMERGING DANGLES FROM THE FUTURE. LET US TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS. LET US REASON IT OUT. I FEEL SUDDENLY ATTACHED NOT TO THE PAST BUT TO THE FUTURE. I THINK OF SUSSEX IN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TO COME. I THINK MUCH GROSSNESS WILL HAVE EVAPORATED. THINGS WILL HAVE BEEN SCORCHED UP ELIMINATED. THERE WILL BE MAGIC GATES. DRAUGHTS FAN-BLOWN BY ELECTRIC POWER WILL CLEANSE HOUSES. LIGHTS INTENSE AND FIRMLY DIRECTED WILL GO OVER THE EARTH DOING THE WORK. LOOK AT THE MOVING LIGHT IN THAT HILL; IT IS THE HEADLIGHT OF A CAR. BY DAY AND BY NIGHT SUSSEX IN FIVE CENTURIES WILL BE FULL OF CHARMING THOUGHTS QUICK EFFECTIVE BEAMS.’

THE SUN WAS NOW LOW BENEATH THE HORIZON. DARKNESS SPREAD RAPIDLY. NONE OF MY SELVES COULD SEE ANYTHING BEYOND THE TAPERING LIGHT OF OUR HEADLAMPS ON THE HEDGE. I SUMMONED THEM TOGETHER. ‘NOW’ I SAID ‘COMES THE SEASON OF MAKING UP OUR ACCOUNTS. NOW WE HAVE GOT TO COLLECT OURSELVES; WE HAVE GOT TO BE ONE SELF. NOTHING IS TO BE SEEN ANY MORE EXCEPT ONE WEDGE OF ROAD AND BANK WHICH OUR LIGHTS REPEAT INCESSANTLY. WE ARE PERFECTLY PROVIDED FOR. WE ARE WARMLY WRAPPED IN A RUG; WE ARE PROTECTED FROM WIND AND RAIN. WE ARE ALONE. NOW IS THE TIME OF RECKONING. NOW I WHO PRESIDE OVER THE COMPANY AM GOING TO ARRANGE IN ORDER THE TROPHIES WHICH WE HAVE ALL BROUGHT IN. LET ME SEE; THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BEAUTY BROUGHT IN TODAY: FARMHOUSES; CLIFFS STANDING OUT TO SEA; MARBLED FIELDS; MOTTLED FIELDS; RED FEATHERED SKIES; ALL THAT. ALSO THERE WAS DISAPPEARANCE AND THE DEATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THE VANISHING ROAD AND THE WINDOW LIT FOR A SECOND AND THEN DARK. AND THEN THERE WAS THE SUDDEN DANCING LIGHT THAT WAS HUNG IN THE FUTURE. WHAT WE HAVE MADE THEN TODAY’ I SAID ‘IS THIS: THAT BEAUTY; DEATH OF THE INDIVIDUAL; AND THE FUTURE. LOOK I WILL MAKE A LITTLE FIGURE FOR YOUR SATISFACTION; HERE HE COMES. DOES THIS LITTLE FIGURE ADVANCING THROUGH BEAUTY THROUGH DEATH TO THE ECONOMICAL POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT FUTURE WHEN HOUSES WILL BE CLEANSED BY A PUFF OF HOT WIND SATISFY YOU? LOOK AT HIM; THERE ON MY KNEE.’ WE SAT AND LOOKED AT THE FIGURE WE HAD MADE THAT DAY. GREAT SHEER SLABS OF ROCK TREE TUFTED SURROUNDED HIM. HE WAS FOR A SECOND VERY VERY SOLEMN. INDEED IT SEEMED AS IF THE REALITY OF THINGS WERE DISPLAYED THERE ON THE RUG. A VIOLENT THRILL RAN THROUGH US; AS IF A CHARGE OF ELECTRICITY HAD ENTERED IN TO US. WE CRIED OUT TOGETHER: ‘YES YES’ AS IF AFFIRMING SOMETHING IN A MOMENT OF RECOGNITION.

AND THEN THE BODY WHO HAD BEEN SILENT UP TO NOW BEGAN ITS SONG ALMOST AT FIRST AS LOW AS THE RUSH OF THE WHEELS: ‘EGGS AND BACON; TOAST AND TEA; FIRE AND A BATH; FIRE AND A BATH; JUGGED HARE’ IT WENT ON ‘AND RED CURRANT JELLY; A GLASS OF WINE; WITH COFFEE TO FOLLOW WITH COFFEE TO FOLLOW—AND THEN TO BED; AND THEN TO BED.’

‘OFF WITH YOU’ I SAID TO MY ASSEMBLED SELVES. ‘YOUR WORK IS DONE. I DISMISS YOU. GOOD-NIGHT.’

AND THE REST OF THE JOURNEY WAS PERFORMED IN THE DELICIOUS SOCIETY OF MY OWN BODY.

FLYING OVER LONDON
FIFTY OR SIXTY AEROPLANES WERE COLLECTED IN THE SHED LIKE A FLOCK OF GRASSHOPPERS. THE GRASSHOPPER HAS THE SAME ENORMOUS THIGHS THE SAME LITTLE BOATSHAPED BODY RESTING BETWEEN ITS THIGHS AND IF TOUCHED WITH A BLADE OF GRASS HE TOO SPRINGS HIGH INTO THE AIR.

THE MECHANICS RAN THE AEROPLANE OUT ONTO THE TURF; AND FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD AT WHOSE INVITATION WE HAD COME TO MAKE OUR FIRST FLIGHT STOOPED DOWN AND MADE THE ENGINE ROAR. A THOUSAND PENS HAVE DESCRIBED THE SENSATION OF LEAVING EARTH; ‘THE EARTH DROPS FROM YOU’ THEY SAY; ONE SITS STILL AND THE WORLD HAS FALLEN. IT IS TRUE THAT THE EARTH FELL BUT WHAT WAS STRANGER WAS THE DOWNFALL OF THE SKY. ONE WAS NOT PREPARED WITHIN A MOMENT OF TAKING OFF TO BE IMMERSED IN IT ALONE WITH IT TO BE IN THE THICK OF IT. HABIT HAS FIXED THE EARTH IMMOVABLY IN THE CENTRE OF THE IMAGINATION LIKE A HARD BALL; EVERYTHING IS MADE TO THE SCALE OF HOUSES AND STREETS. AND AS ONE RISES UP INTO THE SKY AS THE SKY POURS DOWN OVER ONE THIS LITTLE HARD GRANULAR KNOB WITH ITS CARVINGS AND FRETTINGS DISSOLVES CRUMBLES LOSES ITS DOMES ITS PINNACLES ITS FIRESIDES ITS HABITS AND ONE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF BEING A LITTLE MAMMAL HOT-BLOODED HARD BONED WITH A CLOT OF RED BLOOD IN ONE’S BODY TRESPASSING UP HERE IN A FINE AIR; REPUGNANT TO IT UNCLEAN ANTI-PATHETIC. VERTEBRAE RIBS ENTRAILS AND RED BLOOD BELONG TO THE EARTH; TO THE WORLD OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND SHEEP GOING AWKWARDLY ON FOUR POINTED LEGS. HERE ARE WINDS TAPERING VANISHING AND THE UNTIMED MANŒUVRE OF CLOUDS AND NOTHING PERMANENT BUT VANISHING AND MELTING AT THE TOUCH OF EACH OTHER WITHOUT CONCUSSION AND THE FIELDS THAT WITH US ARE METED INTO YARDS AND GROW PUNCTUALLY WHEAT AND BARLEY ARE HERE MADE AND REMADE PERPETUALLY WITH FLOURISHES OF RAIN AND FLIGHTS OF HAIL AND SPACES TRANQUIL AS THE DEEP SEA AND THEN ALL IS CHOP AND CHANGE BREEZE AND MOTION. YET THOUGH WE FLEW THROUGH TERRITORIES WITH NEVER A HEDGE OR STICK TO DIVIDE THEM NAMELESS UNOWNED SO INVETERATELY ANTHROPOCENTRIC IS THE MIND THAT INSTINCTIVELY THE AEROPLANE BECOMES A BOAT AND WE ARE SAILING TOWARDS A HARBOUR AND THERE WE SHALL BE RECEIVED BY HANDS THAT LIFT THEMSELVES FROM SWAYING GARMENTS; WELCOMING ACCEPTING. WRAITHS (OUR ASPIRATIONS AND IMAGINATIONS) HAVE THEIR HOME HERE; AND IN SPITE OF OUR VERTEBRAE RIBS AND ENTRAILS WE ARE ALSO VAPOUR AND AIR AND SHALL BE UNITED.

HERE FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD BY A TOUCH ON THE LEVER TURNED THE NOSE OF THE MOTH* DOWNWARDS. NOTHING MORE FANTASTIC COULD BE IMAGINED. HOUSES STREETS BANKS PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND HABITS AND MUTTON AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS HAD BEEN SWEPT INTO LONG SPIRALS AND CURVES OF PINK AND PURPLE LIKE THAT A WET BRUSH MAKES WHEN IT SWEEPS MOUNDS OF PAINT TOGETHER. ONE COULD SEE THROUGH THE BANK OF ENGLAND; ALL THE BUSINESS HOUSES WERE TRANSPARENT; THE RIVER THAMES WAS AS THE ROMANS SAW IT AS PALEOLITHIC MAN SAW IT AT DAWN FROM A HILL SHAGGY WITH WOOD WITH THE RHINOCEROS DIGGING HIS HORN INTO THE ROOTS OF RHODODENDRONS. SO IMMORTALLY FRESH AND VIRGINAL LONDON LOOKED AND ENGLAND WAS EARTH MERELY MERELY THE WORLD. FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD KEPT HIS FINGER STILL ON THE LEVER WHICH TURNS THE PLANE DOWNWARDS. A SPARK GLINTED ON A GREENHOUSE. THERE ROSE A DOME A SPIRE A FACTORY-CHIMNEY A GASOMETER. CIVILIZATION IN SHORT EMERGED; HANDS AND MINDS WORKED AGAIN; AND THE CENTURIES VANISHED AND THE WILD RHINOCEROS WAS CHASED OUT OF SIGHT FOR EVER. STILL WE DESCENDED. HERE WAS A GARDEN; HERE A FOOTBALL FIELD. BUT NO HUMAN BEING WAS YET VISIBLE; ENGLAND LOOKED LIKE A SHIP THAT SAILS UNMANNED. PERHAPS THE RACE WAS DEAD AND WE SHOULD BOARD THE WORLD LIKE THAT SHIP’S COMPANY WHO FOUND THE SHIP SAILING WITH ALL HER SAILS SET AND THE KETTLE ON THE FIRE BUT NOT A SOUL ON BOARD.* YET A SPOT DOWN THERE SOMETHING SQUAT AND MINUTE MIGHT BE A HORSE—OR A MAN. … BUT HOPGOOD TOUCHED ANOTHER LEVER AND WE ROSE AGAIN LIKE A SPIRIT SHAKING CONTAMINATION FROM ITS WINGS SHAKING GASOMETERS AND FACTORIES AND FOOTBALL FIELDS FROM ITS FEET.

IT WAS A MOMENT OF RENUNCIATION. WE PREFER THE OTHER WE SEEMED TO SAY. WRAITHS AND SAND DUNES AND MIST; IMAGINATION; THIS WE PREFER TO THE MUTTON AND THE ENTRAILS. IT WAS THE IDEA OF DEATH THAT NOW SUGGESTED ITSELF; NOT BEING RECEIVED AND WELCOMED; NOT IMMORTALITY BUT EXTINCTION. FOR THE CLOUDS ABOVE WERE BLACK. ACROSS THEM THERE PASSED IN SINGLE FILE A FLIGHT OF GULLS LIVID WHITE AGAINST THE LEADEN BACKGROUND HOLDING ON THEIR WAY WITH THE AUTHORITY OF OWNERS HAVING RIGHTS AND MEANS OF COMMUNICATION UNKNOWN TO US AN ALIEN A PRIVILEGED RACE. BUT WHERE THERE ARE GULLS ONLY LIFE IS NOT. LIFE ENDS; LIFE IS DOWSED IN THAT CLOUD AS LAMPS ARE DOWSED WITH A WET SPONGE. THAT EXTINCTION HAS BECOME NOW DESIRABLE. FOR IT WAS ODD IN THIS VOYAGE TO NOTE HOW BLINDLY THE TIDE OF THE SOUL AND ITS DESIRES ROLLED THIS WAY AND THAT CARRYING CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE A FEATHER ON THE TOP MARKING THE DIRECTION NOT CONTROLLING IT. AND SO WE SWEPT ON NOW UP TO DEATH.

HOPGOOD’S HEAD CASED IN LEATHER WITH A FURRY RIM TO IT HAD THE SEMBLANCE OF A WINGED PILOT OF CHARON’S* HEAD REMORSELESSLY CONDUCTING HIS PASSENGER TO THE WET SPONGE WHICH ANNIHILATES. FOR THE MIND (ONE CAN BUT REPEAT THESE THINGS WITHOUT CLAIMING SENSE OR TRUTH FOR THEM—MERELY THAT THEY WERE SUCH) IS CONVINCED IN ITS OWN FASTNESS IN ITS SOLITUDE OF EXTINCTION AND WHAT IS MORE PROUD OF IT AS IF IT DESERVED EXTINCTION EXTINCTION PROFITED IT MORE AND WERE MORE DESIRABLE THAN PROLONGATION ON OTHER TERMS BY OTHER WILLS. ‘CHARON’ THE MIND PRAYED TO THE BACK OF FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD ‘CARRY ME ON; THRUST ME DEEP DEEP; TILL EVERY GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN ME OF HEAT OF KNOWLEDGE EVEN THE TINGLING I FEEL IN MY TOES IS DULLED; AFTER ALL THIS LIVING ALL THIS SCRATCHING AND TINGLING OF SENSATION THAT TOO—DARKNESS DULLNESS THE BLACK WET—WILL BE ALSO A SENSATION.’ AND SUCH IS THE INCURABLE VANITY OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT THE CLOUD THE WET SPONGE THAT WAS TO EXTINGUISH BECAME NOW THAT ONE THOUGHT OF A CONTACT WITH ONE’S OWN MIND A FURNACE IN WHICH WE ROARED UP AND OUR DEATH WAS A FIRE; BRANDISHED AT THE SUMMIT OF LIFE MANY TONGUED BLOOD RED VISIBLE OVER LAND AND SEA. EXTINCTION! THE WORD IS CONSUMMATION.

NOW WE WERE IN THE SKIRTS OF THE CLOUD AND THE WINGS OF THE AEROPLANE WERE SPATTERED WITH HAIL; HAIL SHOT PAST SILVER AND STRAIGHT LIKE THE FLASH OF STEEL RAILWAY LINES. INNUMERABLE ARROWS SHOT AT US DOWN THE AUGUST AVENUE OF OUR APPROACH.

THEN CHARON TURNED HIS HEAD WITH ITS FRINGE OF FUR AND LAUGHED AT US. IT WAS AN UGLY FACE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND LITTLE DEEP SUNK EYES AND ALL DOWN ONE CHEEK WAS A CREASE WHERE HE HAD BEEN CUT AND STITCHED TOGETHER. PERHAPS HE WEIGHED FIFTEEN STONE; HE WAS OAK LIMBED AND ANGULAR. BUT FOR ALL THIS NOTHING NOW REMAINED OF FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD BUT A FLAME SUCH AS ONE SEES BLOWN THIN AND FURTIVE AT A STREET CORNER; A FLAME THAT FOR ALL ITS AGILITY CAN HARDLY ESCAPE DEATH. SUCH WAS THE FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT BECOME; AND OURSELVES TOO SO THAT THE CLINGING HANDS THE EMBRACES THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THOSE ABOUT TO DIE TOGETHER WAS VANISHED; THERE WAS NO FLESH. HOWEVER JUST AS ONE COMES TO THE END OF AN AVENUE OF TREES AND FINDS A POND WITH DUCKS ON IT AND NOTHING BUT LEAD-COLOURED WATER SO WE CAME THROUGH THE AVENUE OF HAIL AND OUT INTO A POOL SO STILL SO QUIET WITH HAZE ABOVE AND CLOUD BELOW IT SO THAT WE SEEMED TO FLOAT AS A DUCK FLOATS ON A POND. BUT THE HAZE ABOVE US WAS COMPACT OF WHITENESS. AS COLOUR RUNS TO THE END OF A PAINT BRUSH SO THE BLUE OF THE SKY HAD RUN INTO ONE BLOB BENEATH IT. IT WAS WHITE ABOVE US. AND NOW THE RIBS AND THE ENTRAILS OF THE SPROUT-EATING MAMMAL BEGAN TO BE FROZEN PULVERIZED FROZEN TO LIGHTNESS AND WHITENESS OF THIS SPECTRAL UNIVERSE AND NOTHINGNESS. FOR NO CLOUDS VOYAGED AND LUMBERED UP THERE; WITH LIGHT FONDLING THEM AND MASSES BREAKING OFF THEIR SLOPES OR AGAIN TOWERING AND SWELLING. HERE WAS NO FEATHER NO CREASE TO BREAK THE STEEP WALL ASCENDING FOR EVER UP FOR EVER AND EVER.

AND THOSE YELLOWISH LIGHTS HOPGOOD AND ONESELF WERE PUT OUT EFFECTIVELY AS THE SUN BLANCHES THE FLAME ON A COAL. NO SPONGE EFFACED US WITH ITS DAMP SNOUT. NOTHINGNESS WAS POURED DOWN UPON US LIKE A MOUND OF WHITE SAND. THEN AS IF SOME PART OF US KEPT ITS PONDEROSITY DOWN WE FELL INTO FLEECINESS SUBSTANCE AND COLOUR; ALL THE COLOURS OF POUNDED PLUMS AND DOLPHINS AND BLANKETS AND SEAS AND RAIN CLOUDS CRUSHED TOGETHER STAINING—PURPLE BLACK STEEL ALL THIS SOFT RIPENESS SEETHED ABOUT US AND THE EYE FELT AS A FISH FEELS WHEN IT SLIPS FROM THE ROCK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA.

FOR A TIME WE WERE MUFFLED IN THE CLOUDS. THEN THE FAIRY EARTH APPEARED LYING FAR FAR BELOW A MERE SLICE OR KNIFE BLADE OF COLOUR FLOATING. IT ROSE TOWARDS US WITH EXTREME SPEED BROADENING AND LENGTHENING; FORESTS APPEARED ON IT AND SEAS; AND THEN AGAIN AN UNEASY DARK BLOT WHICH SOON BEGAN TO BE PRICKED WITH SPIRES AND BLOWN INTO BUBBLES AND DOMES. NEARER AND NEARER WE CAME TOGETHER AND HAD AGAIN THE WHOLE OF CIVILIZATION SPREAD BENEATH US SILENT EMPTY LIKE A DEMONSTRATION MADE FOR OUR INSTRUCTION; THE RIVER WITH THE STEAMERS THAT BRING COAL AND IRON; THE CHURCHES THE FACTORIES THE RAILWAYS. NOTHING MOVED; NOBODY WORKED THE MACHINE UNTIL IN SOME FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON ONE SAW A DOT ACTUALLY AND CERTAINLY MOVE. THOUGH THE DOT WAS THE SIZE OF A BLUEBOTTLE AND ITS MOVEMENT MINUTE REASON INSISTED THAT IT WAS A HORSE AND IT WAS GALLOPING BUT ALL SPEED AND SIZE WERE SO REDUCED THAT THE SPEED OF THE HORSE SEEMED VERY VERY SLOW AND ITS SIZE MINUTE. NOW HOWEVER THERE WERE OFTEN MOVEMENTS IN THE STREETS AS OF SLIDING AND STOPPING; AND THEN GRADUALLY THE VAST CREASES OF THE STUFF BENEATH BEGAN MOVING AND ONE SAW IN THE CREASES MILLIONS OF INSECTS MOVING. IN ANOTHER SECOND THEY BECAME MEN MEN OF BUSINESS IN THE HEART OF THE WHITE CITY BUILDINGS.

THROUGH A PAIR OF ZEISS* GLASSES ONE COULD INDEED NOW SEE THE TOPS OF THE HEADS OF SEPARATE MEN AND COULD DISTINGUISH A BOWLER FROM A CAP AND COULD THUS BE CERTAIN OF SOCIAL GRADES—WHICH WAS AN EMPLOYER WHICH WAS A WORKING MAN. AND ONE HAD TO CHANGE PERPETUALLY AIR VALUES INTO LAND VALUES. THERE WERE BLOCKS IN THE CITY OF TRAFFIC SOMETIMES ALMOST A FOOT LONG; THESE HAD TO BE TRANSLATED INTO ELEVEN OR TWELVE ROLLS ROYCES IN A ROW WITH CITY MAGNATES WAITING FURIOUS; AND ONE HAD TO ADD UP THE FURY OF THE MAGNATES; AND SAY—EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALL SILENT AND THE BLOCK WAS ONLY A FEW INCHES IN LENGTH HOW SCANDALOUS THE CONTROL OF THE TRAFFIC IS IN THE CITY OF LONDON.

BUT WITH A TURN OF HIS WRIST FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD FLEW OVER THE POOR QUARTERS* AND THERE THROUGH THE ZEISS GLASSES ONE COULD SEE PEOPLE LOOKING UP AT THE NOISE OF THE AEROPLANE AND COULD JUDGE THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES. IT WAS NOT ONE THAT ONE SEES ORDINARILY. IT WAS COMPLEX. ‘AND I HAVE TO SCRUB THE STEPS’ IT SEEMED TO SAY GRUDGINGLY. ALL THE SAME THEY SALUTED THEY SENT US GREETING; THEY WERE CAPABLE OF FLIGHT. AND AFTER ALL HERE THE HEAD WAS TURNED DOWN AGAIN AND THE SCRUBBING BRUSH WAS GRASPED TIGHTLY TO FALL ON THE PAVEMENT WOULDN’T BE NICE. AND THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS; BUT THEY LOOKED UP AT US AGAIN. BUT FURTHER ON OVER OXFORD STREET PERHAPS IT WAS NOBODY NOTICED US AT ALL BUT WENT ON JOSTLING EACH OTHER WITH SOME FURIOUS DESIRE ABSORBING THEM FOR A SIGHT OF SOMETHING (THERE WAS A YELLOWISH FLASH AS WE PASSED OVERHEAD) IN A SHOP WINDOW. FURTHER BY BAYSWATER PERHAPS WHERE THE PRESS WAS THINNER A FACE A FIGURE SOMETHING ODD IN HAT OR PERSON SUDDENLY CAUGHT ONE’S EYE. AND THEN IT WAS ODD HOW ONE BECAME RESENTFUL OF ALL THE FLAGS AND SURFACES AND OF THE INNUMERABLE WINDOWS SYMMETRICAL AS AVENUES SYMMETRICAL AS FOREST GROVES AND WISHED FOR SOME OPENING AND TO PUSH INDOORS AND BE RID OF SURFACES. UP IN BAYSWATER A DOOR DID OPEN AND INSTANTLY OF COURSE THERE APPEARED A ROOM INCREDIBLY SMALL OF COURSE AND RIDICULOUS IN ITS ATTEMPT TO BE SEPARATE AND ITSELF AND THEN IT WAS A WOMAN’S FACE YOUNG PERHAPS AT ANY RATE WITH A BLACK CLOAK AND A RED HAT THAT MADE THE FURNITURE—HERE A BOWL THERE A SIDEBOARD WITH APPLES ON IT CEASE TO BE INTERESTING BECAUSE THE POWER THAT BUYS A MAT OR SETS TWO COLOURS TOGETHER BECAME PERCEPTIBLE AS ONE MAY SAY THAT THE HAZE OVER AN ELECTRIC FIRE BECOMES PERCEPTIBLE. EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED ITS VALUES SEEN FROM THE AIR. PERSONALITY WAS OUTSIDE THE BODY ABSTRACT. AND ONE WISHED TO BE ABLE TO ANIMATE THE HEART THE LEGS THE ARMS WITH IT TO DO WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BE THERE SO AS TO COLLECT; SO AS TO GIVE UP THIS ARDUOUS GAME AS ONE FLIES THROUGH THE AIR OF ASSEMBLING THINGS THAT LIE ON THE SURFACE.

AND THEN THE FIELD CURVED ROUND US AND WE WERE CAUGHT IN AN EDDY OF GREEN CLOTH AND WHITE RACING PALINGS THAT FLEW ROUND US LIKE TAPE AND TOUCHED EARTH AND WENT AT AN ENORMOUS SPEED PITCHING BUMPING UPON A ROCKY SURFACE HARD CURVES AFTER THE PLUMES OF AIR. WE HAD LANDED AND IT WAS OVER.

AS A MATTER OF FACT THE FLIGHT HAD NOT BEGUN; FOR WHEN FLIGHT-LIEUTENANT HOPGOOD STOOPED AND MADE THE ENGINE ROAR HE HAD FOUND A DEFECT OF SOME SORT IN THE MACHINE AND RAISING HIS HEAD HE HAD SAID VERY SHEEPISHLY ‘’FRAID IT’S NO GO TODAY.’

SO WE HAD NOT FLOWN AFTER ALL.

ALL OF US ALL OF US ALL OF US

               TRYING TO SAVE

               OUR IMMORTAL SOULS SOME WAYS

               SEEMINGLY MORE ROUND-

               ABOUT AND MYSTERIOUS

               THAN OTHERS.

               NOW THAT WE CALL THE LITTLE

               WE REMEMBER OF IT “THE PAST”?

DRINKING WHILE DRIVING
IT’S AUGUST AND I HAVE NOT

READ A BOOK IN SIX MONTHS

EXCEPT SOMETHING CALLED THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW

BY CAULAINCOURT.

NEVERTHELESS I AM HAPPY

RIDING IN A CAR WITH MY BROTHER

AND DRINKING FROM A PINT OF OLD CROW.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PLACE IN MIND TO GO

WE ARE JUST DRIVING.

IF I CLOSED MY EYES FOR A MINUTE

I WOULD BE LOST YET

I COULD GLADLY LIE DOWN AND SLEEP FOREVER

BESIDE THIS ROAD.

MY BROTHER NUDGES ME.

ANY MINUTE NOW SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.

LUCK
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

I HAD BEEN AROUND LIQUOR

ALL MY LIFE. MY FRIENDS

DRANK TOO BUT THEY COULD HANDLE IT.

WE’D TAKE CIGARETTES BEER

A COUPLE OF GIRLS

AND GO OUT TO THE FORT.

WE’D ACT SILLY.

SOMETIMES YOU’D PRETEND

TO PASS OUT SO THE GIRLS

COULD EXAMINE YOU.

THEY’D PUT THEIR HANDS

DOWN YOUR PANTS WHILE

YOU LAY THERE TRYING

NOT TO LAUGH OR ELSE

THEY WOULD LEAN BACK

CLOSE THEIR EYES AND

LET YOU FEEL THEM ALL OVER.

ONCE AT A PARTY MY DAD

CAME TO THE BACK PORCH

TO TAKE A LEAK.

WE COULD HEAR VOICES

OVER THE RECORD PLAYER

SEE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND

LAUGHING AND DRINKING.

WHEN MY DAD FINISHED

HE ZIPPED UP STARED A WHILE

AT THE STARRY SKY—IT WAS

ALWAYS STARRY THEN

ON SUMMER NIGHTS —

AND WENT BACK INSIDE.

THE GIRLS HAD TO GO HOME.

I SLEPT ALL NIGHT IN THE FORT

WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

WE KISSED ON THE LIPS

AND TOUCHED EACH OTHER.

I SAW THE STARS FADE

TOWARD MORNING.

I SAW A WOMAN SLEEPING

ON OUR LAWN.

I LOOKED UP HER DRESS

THEN I HAD A BEER

AND A CIGARETTE.

FRIENDS I THOUGHT THIS

WAS LIVING.

INDOORS SOMEONE

HAD PUT OUT A CIGARETTE

IN A JAR OF MUSTARD.

I HAD A STRAIGHT SHOT

FROM THE BOTTLE THEN

A DRINK OF WARM COLLINS MIX

THEN ANOTHER WHISKY.

AND THOUGH I WENT FROM ROOM

TO ROOM NO ONE WAS HOME.

WHAT LUCK I THOUGHT.

YEARS LATER

I STILL WANTED TO GIVE UP

FRIENDS LOVE STARRY SKIES

FOR A HOUSE WHERE NO ONE

WAS HOME NO ONE COMING BACK

AND ALL I COULD DRINK.

DISTRESS SALE
EARLY ONE SUNDAY MORNING EVERYTHING OUTSIDE —

THE CHILD’S CANOPY BED AND VANITY TABLE

THE SOFA END TABLES AND LAMPS BOXES

OF ASSORTED BOOKS AND RECORDS. WE CARRIED OUT

KITCHEN ITEMS A CLOCK RADIO HANGING

CLOTHES A BIG EASY CHAIR

WITH THEM FROM THE BEGINNING

AND WHICH THEY CALLED UNCLE.

LASTLY WE BROUGHT OUT THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF

AND THEY SET UP AROUND THAT TO DO BUSINESS.

THE SKY PROMISES TO HOLD FAIR.

I’M STAYING HERE WITH THEM TRYING TO DRY OUT.

I SLEPT ON THAT CANOPY BED LAST NIGHT.

THIS BUSINESS IS HARD ON US ALL.

IT’S SUNDAY AND THEY HOPE TO CATCH THE TRADE

FROM THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH NEXT DOOR.

WHAT A SITUATION HERE! WHAT DISGRACE!

EVERYONE WHO SEES THIS COLLECTION OF JUNK

ON THE SIDEWALK IS BOUND TO BE MORTIFIED.

THE WOMAN A FAMILY MEMBER A LOVED ONE

A WOMAN WHO ONCE WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS

SHE CHATS WITH FELLOW PARISHIONERS WHO

SMILE AWKWARDLY AND FINGER ITEMS

OF CLOTHING BEFORE MOVING ON.

THE MAN MY FRIEND SITS AT THE TABLE

AND TRIES TO LOOK INTERESTED IN WHAT

HE’S READING—FROISSART’S CHRONICLES IT IS

I CAN SEE IT FROM THE WINDOW.

MY FRIEND IS FINISHED DONE FOR AND HE KNOWS IT.

WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? CAN NO ONE HELP THEM?

MUST EVERYONE WITNESS THEIR DOWNFALL?

THIS REDUCES US ALL.

SOMEONE MUST SHOW UP AT ONCE TO SAVE THEM

TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF THEIR HANDS RIGHT NOW

EVERY TRACE OF THIS LIFE BEFORE

THIS HUMILIATION GOES ON ANY LONGER.

SOMEONE MUST DO SOMETHING.

I REACH FOR MY WALLET AND THAT IS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT:

I CAN’T HELP ANYONE.

YOUR DOG DIES
IT GETS RUN OVER BY A VAN.

YOU FIND IT AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

AND BURY IT.

YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

YOU FEEL BAD PERSONALLY

BUT YOU FEEL BAD FOR YOUR DAUGHTER

BECAUSE IT WAS HER PET

AND SHE LOVED IT SO.

SHE USED TO CROON TO IT

AND LET IT SLEEP IN HER BED.

YOU WRITE A POEM ABOUT IT.

YOU CALL IT A POEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTER

ABOUT THE DOG GETTING RUN OVER BY A VAN

AND HOW YOU LOOKED AFTER IT

TOOK IT OUT INTO THE WOODS

AND BURIED IT DEEP DEEP

AND THAT POEM TURNS OUT SO GOOD

YOU’RE ALMOST GLAD THE LITTLE DOG

WAS RUN OVER OR ELSE YOU’D NEVER

HAVE WRITTEN THAT GOOD POEM.

THEN YOU SIT DOWN TO WRITE

A POEM ABOUT WRITING A POEM

ABOUT THE DEATH OF THAT DOG

BUT WHILE YOU’RE WRITING YOU

HEAR A WOMAN SCREAM

YOUR NAME YOUR FIRST NAME

BOTH SYLLABLES

AND YOUR HEART STOPS.

AFTER A MINUTE YOU CONTINUE WRITING.

SHE SCREAMS AGAIN.

YOU WONDER HOW LONG THIS CAN GO ON.

PHOTOGRAPH OF MY FATHER IN HIS TWENTY-SECOND YEAR
OCTOBER. HERE IN THIS DANK UNFAMILIAR KITCHEN

I STUDY MY FATHER’S EMBARRASSED YOUNG MAN’S FACE.

SHEEPISH GRIN HE HOLDS IN ONE HAND A STRING

OF SPINY YELLOW PERCH IN THE OTHER

A BOTTLE OF CARLSBAD BEER.

IN JEANS AND DENIM SHIRT HE LEANS

AGAINST THE FRONT FENDER OF A 1934 FORD.

HE WOULD LIKE TO POSE BLUFF AND HEARTY FOR HIS POSTERITY

WEAR HIS OLD HAT COCKED OVER HIS EAR.

ALL HIS LIFE MY FATHER WANTED TO BE BOLD.

BUT THE EYES GIVE HIM AWAY AND THE HANDS

THAT LIMPLY OFFER THE STRING OF DEAD PERCH

AND THE BOTTLE OF BEER. FATHER I LOVE YOU

YET HOW CAN I SAY THANK YOU I WHO CAN’T HOLD MY LIQUOR EITHER

AND DON’T EVEN KNOW THE PLACES TO FISH?

HAMID RAMOUZ (1818—1906)
THIS MORNING I BEGAN A POEM ON HAMID RAMOUZ —

SOLDIER SCHOLAR DESERT EXPLORER —

WHO DIED BY HIS OWN HAND GUNSHOT AT EIGHTY-EIGHT.

I HAD TRIED TO READ THE DICTIONARY ENTRY ON THAT CURIOUS MAN

TO MY SON—WE WERE AFTER SOMETHING ON RALEIGH —

BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT AND RIGHTLY SO.

IT HAPPENED MONTHS AGO THE BOY IS WITH HIS MOTHER NOW

BUT I REMEMBERED THE NAME: RAMOUZ —

AND A POEM BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE.

ALL MORNING I SAT AT THE TABLE

HANDS MOVING BACK AND FORTH OVER LIMITLESS WASTE

AS I TRIED TO RECALL THAT STRANGE LIFE.

BANKRUPTCY
TWENTY-EIGHT HAIRY BELLY HANGING OUT

OF MY UNDERSHIRT (EXEMPT)

I LIE HERE ON MY SIDE

ON THE COUCH (EXEMPT)

AND LISTEN TO THE STRANGE SOUND

OF MY WIFE’S PLEASANT VOICE (ALSO EXEMPT).

WE ARE NEW ARRIVALS

TO THESE SMALL PLEASURES.

FORGIVE ME (I PRAY THE COURT)

THAT WE HAVE BEEN IMPROVIDENT.

TODAY MY HEART LIKE THE FRONT DOOR

STANDS OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS.

THE BAKER
THEN PANCHO VILLA CAME TO TOWN

HANGED THE MAYOR

AND SUMMONED THE OLD AND INFIRM

COUNT VRONSKY TO SUPPER.

PANCHO INTRODUCED HIS NEW GIRL FRIEND

ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND IN HIS WHITE APRON

SHOWED VRONSKY HIS PISTOL

THEN ASKED THE COUNT TO TELL HIM

ABOUT HIS UNHAPPY EXILE IN MEXICO.

LATER THE TALK WAS OF WOMEN AND HORSES.

BOTH WERE EXPERTS.

THE GIRL FRIEND GIGGLED

AND FUSSED WITH THE PEARL BUTTONS

ON PANCHO’S SHIRT UNTIL

PROMPTLY AT MIDNIGHT PANCHO WENT TO SLEEP

WITH HIS HEAD ON THE TABLE.

THE HUSBAND CROSSED HIMSELF

AND LEFT THE HOUSE HOLDING HIS BOOTS

WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SIGN

TO HIS WIFE OR VRONSKY.

THAT ANONYMOUS HUSBAND BAREFOOTED

HUMILIATED TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE HE

IS THE HERO OF THIS POEM.

IOWA SUMMER
THE PAPERBOY SHAKES ME AWAKE. “I HAVE BEEN DREAMING YOU’D COME”

I TELL HIM RISING FROM THE BED. HE IS ACCOMPANIED

BY A GIANT NEGRO FROM THE UNIVERSITY WHO SEEMS

ITCHING TO GET HIS HANDS ON ME. I STALL FOR TIME.

SWEAT RUNS OFF OUR FACES; WE STAND WAITING.

I DO NOT OFFER THEM CHAIRS AND NO ONE SPEAKS.

IT IS ONLY LATER AFTER THEY’VE GONE

I REALIZE THEY HAVE DELIVERED A LETTER.

IT’S A LETTER FROM MY WIFE. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING

THERE?” MY WIFE ASKS. “ARE YOU DRINKING?”

I STUDY THE POSTMARK FOR HOURS. THEN IT TOO BEGINS TO FADE.

I HOPE SOMEDAY TO FORGET ALL THIS.

ALCOHOL
THAT PAINTING NEXT TO THE BROCADED DRAPERY

IS A DELACROIX. THIS IS CALLED A DIVAN

NOT A DAVENPORT; THIS ITEM IS A SETTEE.

NOTICE THE ORNATE LEGS.

PUT ON YOUR TARBOOSH. SMELL THE BURNT CORK

UNDER YOUR EYES. ADJUST YOUR TUNIC SO.

NOW THE RED CUMMERBUND AND PARIS; APRIL 1934.

A BLACK CITRÖEN WAITS AT THE CURB.

THE STREET LAMPS ARE LIT.

GIVE THE DRIVER THE ADDRESS BUT TELL HIM

NOT TO HURRY THAT YOU HAVE ALL NIGHT.

WHEN YOU GET THERE DRINK MAKE LOVE

DO THE SHIMMY AND THE BEGUINE.

AND WHEN THE SUN COMES UP OVER THE QUARTER

NEXT MORNING AND THAT PRETTY WOMAN

YOU’VE HAD AND HAD ALL NIGHT

NOW WANTS TO GO HOME WITH YOU

BE TENDER WITH HER DON’T DO ANYTHING

YOU’LL BE SORRY FOR LATER. BRING HER HOME

WITH YOU IN THE CITROËN LET HER SLEEP

IN A PROPER BED. LET HER

FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND YOU

WITH HER AND THEN … SOMETHING: ALCOHOL

A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL ALWAYS ALCOHOL —

WHAT YOU’VE REALLY DONE

AND TO SOMEONE ELSE THE ONE

YOU MEANT TO LOVE FROM THE START.

IT’S AFTERNOON AUGUST SUN STRIKING

THE HOOD OF A DUSTY FORD

PARKED ON YOUR DRIVEWAY IN SAN JOSE.

IN THE FRONT SEAT A WOMAN

WHO IS COVERING HER EYES AND LISTENING

TO AN OLD SONG ON THE RADIO.

YOU STAND IN THE DOORWAY AND WATCH.

YOU HEAR THE SONG. AND IT IS LONG AGO.

YOU LOOK FOR IT WITH THE SUN IN YOUR FACE.

BUT YOU DON’T REMEMBER.

YOU HONESTLY DON’T REMEMBER.

BUT WHEN I TRY TO RISE

THE HOUSE TILTS.

WHO’S DREAMING?

IT’S NOON SHE SAYS.

MY NEW SHOES WAIT BY THE DOOR.

THEY ARE GLEAMING.

CHEERS
VODKA CHASED WITH COFFEE. EACH MORNING

I HANG THE SIGN ON THE DOOR:

OUT TO LUNCH

BUT NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION; MY FRIENDS

LOOK AT THE SIGN AND

SOMETIMES LEAVE LITTLE NOTES

OR ELSE THEY CALL—COME OUT AND PLAY

RAY-MOND.

ONCE MY SON THAT BASTARD

SLIPPED IN AND LEFT ME A COLORED EGG

AND A WALKING STICK.

I THINK HE DRANK SOME OF MY VODKA.

AND LAST WEEK MY WIFE DROPPED BY

I SHALL BE I SHALL BE I SHALL BE…

I INTEND TO TAKE ALL THE TIME IN THIS WORLD

CONSIDER EVERYTHING EVEN MIRACLES

MORE CAREFUL MORE WATCHFUL

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD SIN AGAINST ME

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD STEAL VODKA

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD DO ME HARM.

I AM NOT DRINKING. FOR THIS

YOU HAVE PUT ON YOUR WEDDING RING AND DRIVEN

500 MILES TO SEE FOR YOURSELF.

THIS LIGHT DAZZLES. I FILL MY LUNGS

AS IF THESE LAST YEARS

WERE NOTHING A LITTLE OVERNIGHT PORTAGE.

WE SIT IN THE BOW OF THE JET-BOAT

CONFUSED HIMSELF AND TELLS US

HE HAS A GLASS EYE AND WE

SHOULD TRY TO GUESS WHICH IS WHICH.

HIS GOOD EYE THE LEFT IS BROWN IS

STEADY OF PURPOSE AND DOESN’T

MISS A THING. NOT LONG PAST

I WOULD HAVE SNAGGED IT OUT

BUT YOU AREN’T LISTENING

THERE ISN’T ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM

WOULD RECOGNIZE LOVE IF IT STEPPED UP

AND BUGGERED YOU IN THE ASS

I USED TO THINK POETRY READINGS WERE A COPOUT

LOOK I’M 51 YEARS OLD AND I’VE BEEN AROUND

I KNOW THEY’RE A COPOUT

BUT I SAID TO MYSELF BUKOWSKI

STARVING IS EVEN MORE OF A COPOUT

SO THERE YOU ARE AND NOTHING IS LIKE IT SHOULD BE

THAT FELLOW WHAT’S HIS NAME GALWAY KINNELL

I SAW HIS PICTURE IN A MAGAZINE

HE HAS A HANDSOME MUG ON HIM

BUT HE’S A TEACHER

CHRIST CAN YOU IMAGINE

BUT THEN YOU’RE TEACHERS TOO

HERE I AM INSULTING YOU ALREADY

NO I HAVEN’T HEARD OF HIM

OR HIM EITHER

THEY’RE ALL TERMITES

MAYBE IT’S EGO I DON’T READ MUCH ANYMORE

BUT THESE PEOPLE WHO BUILD

REPUTATIONS ON FIVE OR SIX BOOKS

TERMITES

BUKOWSKI SHE SAYS

WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

CAN’T YOU HEAR HER SAYING THAT

BUKOWSKI WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

THAT SURPRISES YOU DOESN’T IT

YOU WOULDN’T THINK A CRUDE BASTARD LIKE ME

COULD LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

BRAHMS RACHMANINOFF BARTOK TELEMANN

SHIT I COULDN’T WRITE UP HERE

TOO QUIET UP HERE TOO MANY TREES

I LIKE THE CITY THAT’S THE PLACE FOR ME

I PUT ON MY CLASSICAL MUSIC EACH MORNING

AND SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF MY TYPEWRITER

I LIGHT A CIGAR AND I SMOKE IT LIKE THIS SEE

AND I SAY BUKOWSKI YOU’RE A LUCKY MAN

BUKOWSKI YOU’VE GONE THROUGH IT ALL

AND YOU’RE A LUCKY MAN

AND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTS ACROSS THE TABLE

AND I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ONTO DELONGPRE AVENUE

AND I SEE PEOPLE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE SIDEWALK

AND I PUFF ON THE CIGAR LIKE THIS

AND THEN I LAY THE CIGAR IN THE ASHTRAY LIKE THIS

AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH

AND I BEGIN TO WRITE

BUKOWSKI THIS IS THE LIFE I SAY

IT’S GOOD TO BE POOR IT’S GOOD TO HAVE HEMORRHOIDS

IT’S GOOD TO BE IN LOVE

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE IN LOVE

IF YOU COULD SEE HER YOU’D KNOW WHAT I MEAN

SHE THOUGHT I’D COME UP HERE AND GET LAID

SHE JUST KNEW IT

SHE TOLD ME SHE KNEW IT

SHIT I’M 51 YEARS OLD AND SHE’S 25

AND WE’RE IN LOVE AND SHE’S JEALOUS

JESUS IT’S BEAUTIFUL

SHE SAID SHE’D CLAW MY EYES OUT IF I CAME UP HERE AND GOT LAID

NOW THAT’S LOVE FOR YOU

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

I’VE MET MEN IN JAIL WHO HAD MORE STYLE

THAN THE PEOPLE WHO HANG AROUND COLLEGES

AND GO TO POETRY READINGS

THEY’RE BLOODSUCKERS WHO COME TO SEE

IF THE POET’S SOCKS ARE DIRTY

OR IF HE SMELLS UNDER THE ARMS

BELIEVE ME I WON’T DISAPPOINT EM

BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS

THERE’S ONLY ONE POET IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT

ONLY ONE POET IN THIS TOWN TONIGHT

MAYBE ONLY ONE REAL POET IN THIS COUNTRY TONIGHT

AND THAT’S ME

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT LIFE

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING

WHICH OF YOU HERE HAS BEEN FIRED FROM A JOB

OR ELSE HAS BEATEN UP YOUR BROAD

OR ELSE HAS BEEN BEATEN UP BY YOUR BROAD

I WAS FIRED FROM SEARS AND ROEBUCK FIVE TIMES

THEY’D FIRE ME THEN HIRE ME BACK AGAIN

I WAS A STOCKBOY FOR THEM WHEN I WAS 35

AND THEN GOT CANNED FOR STEALING COOKIES

I KNOW WHAT’S IT LIKE I’VE BEEN THERE

I’M 51 YEARS OLD NOW AND I’M IN LOVE

THIS LITTLE BROAD SHE SAYS

BUKOWSKI

AND I SAY WHAT AND SHE SAYS

I THINK YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT

AND I SAY BABY YOU UNDERSTAND ME

SHE’S THE ONLY BROAD IN THE WORLD

MAN OR WOMAN

I’D TAKE THAT FROM

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS

THEY ALL CAME BACK TO ME IN THE END TOO

EVERY ONE OF EM CAME BACK

EXCEPT THAT ONE I TOLD YOU ABOUT

THE ONE I PLANTED

WE WERE TOGETHER SEVEN YEARS

WE USED TO DRINK A LOT

I SEE A COUPLE OF TYPERS IN THIS ROOM BUT

I DON’T SEE ANY POETS

I’M NOT SURPRISED

YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN IN LOVE TO WRITE POETRY

AND YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE

THAT’S YOUR TROUBLE

GIVE ME SOME OF THAT STUFF

THAT’S RIGHT NO ICE GOOD

THAT’S GOOD THAT’S JUST FINE

SO LET’S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD

I KNOW WHAT I SAID BUT I’LL HAVE JUST ONE

THAT TASTES GOOD

OKAY THEN LET’S GO LET’S GET THIS OVER WITH

ONLY AFTERWARDS DON’T ANYONE STAND CLOSE

TO AN OPEN WINDOW

THE BLUE STONES
IF I CALL STONES BLUE IT IS BECAUSE

BLUE IS THE PRECISE WORD BELIEVE ME.

— FLAUBERT

YOU ARE WRITING A LOVE SCENE

BETWEEN EMMA BOVARY AND RODOLPHE BOULANGER

BUT LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

YOU ARE WRITING ABOUT SEXUAL DESIRE

THAT LONGING OF ONE PERSON TO POSSESS ANOTHER

WHOSE ULTIMATE AIM IS PENETRATION.

LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

YOU WRITE AND WRITE THAT SCENE

UNTIL YOU AROUSE YOURSELF

MASTURBATE INTO A HANDKERCHIEF.

STILL YOU DON’T GET UP FROM THE DESK

FOR HOURS. YOU GO ON WRITING THAT SCENE

WRITING ABOUT HUNGER BLIND ENERGY —

THE VERY NATURE OF SEX —

A FIERY LEANING INTO CONSEQUENCE

AND EVENTUALLY UTTER RUIN

IF UNBRIDLED. AND SEX

WHAT IS SEX IF IT IS NOT UNBRIDLED?

YOU WALK ON THE STRAND THAT NIGHT

WITH YOUR MAGPIE FRIEND ED GONCOURT.

YOU TELL HIM WHEN YOU WRITE

LOVE SCENES THESE DAYS YOU CAN JACKOFF

WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR DESK.

“LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT” YOU SAY.

YOU ENJOY A CIGAR AND A CLEAR VIEW OF JERSEY.

THE TIDE IS GOING OUT ACROSS THE SHINGLE

AND NOTHING ON EARTH CAN STOP IT.

THE SMOOTH STONES YOU PICK UP AND EXAMINE

UNDER THE MOON’S LIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BLUE

FROM THE SEA. NEXT MORNING WHEN YOU PULL THEM

FROM YOUR TROUSER POCKET THEY ARE STILL BLUE.

TEL AVIV AND LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI
THIS AFTERNOON THE MISSISSIPPI —

HIGH ROILY UNDER A BROILING SUN

OR LOW RIPPLING UNDER STARLIGHT

SET WITH DEADLY SNAGS COME OUT TO FISH

FOR STEAMBOATS —

THE MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON

HAS NEVER SEEMED SO FAR AWAY.

PLANTATIONS PASS IN THE DARKNESS;

THERE’S JONES’S LANDING APPEARING OUT

OF NOWHERE OUT OF PINE TREES

AND HERE AT 12-MILE POINT GRAY’S

OVERSEER REACHES OUT OF FOG AND RECEIVES

EVERYTHING

EVEN HOW YOU GOT YOUR NAME

QUARTER TWAIN MARK TWAIN

SOMETHING EVERY SCHOOLBOY KNEW

SAVE ONE.

I HANG MY LEGS FURTHER OVER THE BANISTER

AND LEAN BACK IN SHADE

HOLDING TO THE BOOK LIKE A WHEEL

SWEATING FOOLING MY LIFE AWAY

AS SOME CHILDREN HAGGLE

THEN FIERCELY SLAP EACH OTHER

IN THE FIELD BELOW.

THE NEWS CARRIED TO MACEDONIA
ON THE BANKS OF THE

    RIVER THEY CALL INDUS TODAY

WE OBSERVE A KIND OF

BEAN

    MUCH LIKE THE EGYPTIAN BEAN

    ALSO

CROCODILES ARE REPORTED

UPSTREAM & HILLSIDES GROWN OVER

    WITH MYRRH & IVY

               HE BELIEVES

WE HAVE LOCATED THE HEADWATERS

OF THE RIVER NILE

    WE OFFER

SACRIFICE

HOLD GAMES

    FOR THE OCCASION

THERE IS MUCH REJOICING &

               THE MEN THINK

    WE SHALL TURN BACK

THESE ELEPHANTS THEIR

EMISSARIES OFFER

    ARE GIANT

TERRIFYING BEASTS YET

    WITH A GRIN HE YESTERDAY

RAN UP A LADDER ONTO

          THE VERY TOP OF ONE

    BEAST

THE MEN

               CHEERED HIM & HE

WAVED & THEY CHEERED HIM

    AGAIN

HE POINTED ACROSS THE RIVER

    & THE MEN GREW SILENT

THE BUILDERS

BUSY THEMSELVES WITH GREAT RAFTS

    AT THE WATER’S EDGE

         ON THE MORROW

WE AGAIN SET OUR FACES

    TO THE EAST

TONIGHT

               WIND    BIRDS

FILL THE AIR

    THE CLACKING OF THEIR BILLS

LIKE IRON ON IRON

THE WIND

               IS STEADY IS FRAGRANT

    WITH JASMINE

TRAIL OF THE COUNTRY BEHIND US

THE WIND MOVES

               THROUGH THE CAMP

STIRS THE TENTS OF

THE HETAERI

    TOUCHES EACH

OF THE SLEEPING SOLDIERS

EUOI! EUOI!

    MEN CRY OUT

IN THEIR SLEEP & THE HORSES

               PRICK THEIR EARS & STAND

    SHIVERING

IN A FEW HOURS

THEY ALL SHALL WAKE

    WITH THE SUN

SHALL FOLLOW THE WIND

               EVEN FURTHER

THE MOSQUE IN JAFFA
I LEAN OVER THE BALCONY OF THE MINARET.

MY HEAD SWIMS.

A FEW STEPS AWAY THE MAN WHO INTENDS

TO BETRAY ME BEGINS BY POINTING OUT

KEY SIGHTS —

MARKET CHURCH PRISON WHOREHOUSE.

KILLED HE SAYS.

WORDS LOST IN THE WIND BUT

DRAWING A FINGER ACROSS HIS THROAT

SO I WILL GET IT.

HE GRINS.

THE KEY WORDS FLY OUT —

TURKS GREEKS ARABS JEWS

TRADE WORSHIP LOVE MURDER

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

HE GRINS AGAIN AT SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

HE KNOWS I AM WATCHING HIM.

STILL HE WHISTLES CONFIDENTLY

AS WE START DOWN THE STEPS

BUMPING AGAINST EACH OTHER GOING DOWN

COMMINGLING BREATH AND BODIES IN THE NARROW SPIRALLING DARK.

DOWNSTAIRS HIS FRIENDS ARE WAITING

WITH A CAR. WE ALL OF US LIGHT CIGARETTES

AND THINK WHAT TO DO NEXT.

TIME LIKE THE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES

IS RUNNING OUT AS WE CLIMB IN.

NOT FAR FROM HERE
NOT FAR FROM HERE SOMEONE

IS CALLING MY NAME.

I JUMP TO THE FLOOR.

STILL THIS COULD BE A TRAP.

CAREFUL CAREFUL.

I LOOK UNDER THE COVERS FOR MY KNIFE.

BUT EVEN AS I CURSE GOD

FOR THE DELAY THE DOOR IS THROWN OPEN

AND A LONG-HAIRED BRAT ENTERS

CARRYING A DOG.

WHAT IS IT CHILD? (WE ARE BOTH

TREMBLING.) WHAT DO YOU WANT?

BUT THE TONGUE ONLY HOPS AND FLUTTERS

IN HER OPEN MOUTH

AS A SINGLE SOUND RISES IN HER THROAT.

I MOVE CLOSER KNEEL

AND PLACE MY EAR AGAINST THE TINY LIPS.

WHEN I STAND UP—THE DOG GRINS.

LISTEN I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.

HERE I SAY HERE—AND I SEND HER AWAY

WITH A PLUM.

SUDDEN RAIN
•

RAIN HISSES ONTO STONES AS OLD MEN AND WOMEN

DRIVE DONKEYS TO COVER.

WE STAND IN RAIN MORE FOOLISH THAN DONKEYS

AND SHOUT WALK UP AND DOWN IN RAIN AND ACCUSE.

•

WHEN RAIN STOPS THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN

WHO HAVE WAITED QUIETLY IN DOORWAYS SMOKING

LEAD THEIR DONKEYS OUT ONCE MORE AND UP THE HILL.

•

BEHIND ALWAYS BEHIND I CLIMB THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS.

I ROLL MY EYES. I CLATTER AGAINST STONES.

BALZAC
I THINK OF BALZAC IN HIS NIGHTCAP AFTER

THIRTY HOURS AT HIS WRITING DESK

MIST RISING FROM HIS FACE

THE GOWN CLINGING

TO HIS HAIRY THIGHS AS

HE SCRATCHES HIMSELF LINGERS

AT THE OPEN WINDOW.

OUTSIDE ON THE BOULEVARDS

THE PLUMP WHITE HANDS OF THE CREDITORS

STROKE MOUSTACHES AND CRAVATS

YOUNG LADIES DREAM OF CHATEAUBRIAND

AND PROMENADE WITH THE YOUNG MEN WHILE

EMPTY CARRIAGES RATTLE BY SMELLING

OF AXLE-GREASE AND LEATHER.

LIKE A HUGE DRAUGHT HORSE BALZAC

YAWNS SNORTS LUMBERS

TO THE WATERCLOSET

AND FLINGING OPEN HIS GOWN

TRAINS A GREAT STREAM OF PISS INTO THE

EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY

CHAMBERPOT. THE LACE CURTAIN CATCHES

THE BREEZE. WAIT! ONE LAST SCENE

BEFORE SLEEP. HIS BRAIN SIZZLES AS

HE GOES BACK TO HIS DESK—THE PEN

THE POT OF INK THE STREWN PAGES.

COUNTRY MATTERS
A GIRL PUSHES A BICYCLE THROUGH TALL GRASS

THROUGH OVERTURNED GARDEN FURNITURE WATER

RISING TO HER ANKLES. CUPS WITHOUT HANDLES

SAIL UPON THE MURKY WATER SAUCERS

WITH FINE CRACKS IN THE PORCELAIN.

AT THE UPSTAIRS WINDOW BEHIND DAMASK CURTAINS

THE STEWARD’S PALE BLUE EYES FOLLOW.

HE TRIES TO CALL.

SHREDS OF YELLOW NOTE PAPER

FLOAT OUT ONTO THE WINTRY AIR BUT THE GIRL

DOES NOT TURN HER HEAD.

COOK IS AWAY NO ONE HEARS.

THEN TWO FISTS APPEAR ON THE WINDOW SILL.

HE LEANS CLOSER TO HEAR THE SMALL

WHISPERINGS THE BROKEN STORY THE EXCUSES.

THIS ROOM
THIS ROOM FOR INSTANCE:

IS THAT AN EMPTY COACH

THAT WAITS BELOW?

    PROMISES PROMISES

    TELL THEM NOTHING

    FOR MY SAKE.

I REMEMBER PARASOLS

AN ESPLANADE BESIDE THE SEA

YET THESE FLOWERS…

    MUST I EVER REMAIN BEHIND —

    LISTENING SMOKING

    SCRIBBLING DOWN THE NEXT FAR THING?

I LIGHT A CIGARETTE

AND ADJUST THE WINDOW SHADE.

THERE IS A NOISE IN THE STREET

GROWING FAINTER FAINTER.

RHODES
•

I DON’T KNOW THE NAMES OF FLOWERS

OR ONE TREE FROM ANOTHER

NEVERTHELESS I SIT IN THE SQUARE

UNDER A CLOUD OF PAPISOSTROS SMOKE

AND SIP HELLAS BEER.

SOMEWHERE NEARBY THERE IS A COLOSSUS

WAITING FOR ANOTHER ARTIST

ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE.

BUT I’M NOT AMBITIOUS.

I’D LIKE TO STAY IT’S TRUE

THOUGH I’D WANT TO HANG OUT

WITH THE CIVIC DEER THAT SURROUND

THE HOSPITALER CASTLE ON THE HILL.

THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL DEER

AND THEIR LEAN HAUNCHES FLICKER

UNDER AN ASSAULT OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES.

•

HIGH ON THE BATTLEMENT A TALL STIFF

FIGURE OF A MAN KEEPS WATCH ON TURKEY.

A WARM RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.

A PEACOCK SHAKES DROPS OF WATER

FROM ITS TAIL AND HEADS FOR COVER.

IN THE MOSLEM GRAVEYARD A CAT SLEEPS

IN A NICHE BETWEEN TWO STONES.

JUST TIME FOR A LOOK

INTO THE CASINO EXCEPT

I’M NOT DRESSED.

•

BACK ON BOARD READY FOR BED

I LIE DOWN AND REMEMBER

I’VE BEEN TO RHODES.

BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ELSE —

I HEAR AGAIN THE VOICE

OF THE CROUPIER CALLING

THIRTY-TWO THIRTY-TWO

AS MY BODY FLIES OVER WATER

AS MY SOUL POISED LIKE A CAT HOVERS —

THEN LEAPS INTO SLEEP.

SPRING 480 BC
ENRAGED BY WHAT HE CALLED

    THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE HELLESPONT

                         IN BLOWING UP A STORM

               WHICH BROUGHT TO A HALT

                         HIS ARMY OF 2 MILLION

                                        HERODOTUS RELATES

                         THAT XERXES ORDERED 300

                                        LASHES BE GIVEN

         THAT UNRULY BODY OF WATER BESIDES

    THROWING IN A PAIR OF FETTERS FOLLOWED

               BY A BRANDING WITH HOT IRONS.

YOU CAN IMAGINE

    HOW THIS NEWS WAS RECEIVED

                         AT ATHENS; I MEAN

    THAT THE PERSIANS WERE ON THE MARCH.

NEAR KLAMATH
WE STAND AROUND THE BURNING OIL DRUM

AND WE WARM OURSELVES OUR HANDS

AND FACES IN ITS PURE LAPPING HEAT.

WE RAISE STEAMING CUPS OF COFFEE

TO OUR LIPS AND WE DRINK IT

WITH BOTH HANDS. BUT WE ARE SALMON

FISHERMEN. AND NOW WE STAMP OUR FEET

ON THE SNOW AND ROCKS AND MOVE UPSTREAM

SLOWLY FULL OF LOVE TOWARD THE STILL POOLS.

AUTUMN
THIS YARDFUL OF THE LANDLORD’S USED CARS

DOES NOT INTRUDE. THE LANDLORD

HIMSELF DOES NOT INTRUDE. HE HUNCHES

ALL DAY OVER A SWAGE

OR ELSE IS ENVELOPED IN THE BLUE FLAME

OF THE ARC-WELDING DEVICE.

               HE TAKES NOTE OF ME THOUGH

OFTEN STOPPING WORK TO GRIN

AND NOD AT ME THROUGH THE WINDOW. HE EVEN

APOLOGIZES FOR PARKING HIS LOGGING GEAR

IN MY LIVING ROOM.

               BUT WE REMAIN FRIENDS.

SLOWLY THE DAYS THIN AND WE

MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS SPRING

TOWARDS HIGH WATER THE JACK-SALMON

THE SEA-RUN CUTTHROAT.

WINTER INSOMNIA
THE MIND CAN’T SLEEP CAN ONLY LIE AWAKE AND

GORGE LISTENING TO THE SNOW GATHER AS

FOR SOME FINAL ASSAULT.

IT WISHES CHEKHOV WERE HERE TO MINISTER

SOMETHING—THREE DROPS OF VALERIAN A GLASS

OF ROSE WATER—ANYTHING IT WOULDN’T MATTER.

THE MIND WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE

ONTO THE SNOW. IT WOULD LIKE TO RUN

WITH A PACK OF SHAGGY ANIMALS ALL TEETH

UNDER THE MOON ACROSS THE SNOW LEAVING

NO PRINTS OR SPOOR NOTHING BEHIND.

THE MIND IS SICK TONIGHT.

PROSSER
IN WINTER TWO KINDS OF FIELDS ON THE HILLS

OUTSIDE PROSSER: FIELDS OF NEW GREEN WHEAT THE SLIPS

RISING OVERNIGHT OUT OF THE PLOWED GROUND

AND WAITING

AND THEN RISING AGAIN AND BUDDING.

GEESE LOVE THIS GREEN WHEAT.

I ATE SOME OF IT ONCE TOO TO SEE.

AND WHEAT STUBBLE-FIELDS THAT REACH TO THE RIVER.

THESE ARE THE FIELDS THAT HAVE LOST EVERYTHING.

AT NIGHT THEY TRY TO RECALL THEIR YOUTH

BUT THEIR BREATHING IS SLOW AND IRREGULAR AS

THEIR LIFE SINKS INTO DARK FURROWS.

GEESE LOVE THIS SHATTERED WHEAT ALSO.

THEY WILL DIE FOR IT.

BUT EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN NEARLY EVERYTHING

AND SOONER RATHER THAN LATER PLEASE GOD —

FATHERS FRIENDS THEY PASS

INTO YOUR LIFE AND OUT AGAIN A FEW WOMEN STAY

A WHILE THEN GO AND THE FIELDS

TURN THEIR BACKS DISAPPEAR IN RAIN.

EVERYTHING GOES BUT PROSSER.

THOSE NIGHTS DRIVING BACK THROUGH MILES OF WHEAT FIELDS —

HEADLAMPS RAKING THE FIELDS ON THE CURVES —

PROSSER THAT TOWN SHINING AS WE BREAK OVER HILLS

HEATER RATTLING TIRED THROUGH TO BONE

THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON OUR FINGERS STILL:

I CAN BARELY SEE HIM MY FATHER SQUINTING

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THAT CAB SAYING PROSSER.

AT NIGHT THE SALMON MOVE
AT NIGHT THE SALMON MOVE

OUT FROM THE RIVER AND INTO TOWN.

THEY AVOID PLACES WITH NAMES

LIKE FOSTER’S FREEZE A & W SMILEY’S

BUT SWIM CLOSE TO THE TRACT

HOMES ON WRIGHT AVENUE WHERE SOMETIMES

IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS

YOU CAN HEAR THEM TRYING DOORKNOBS

OR BUMPING AGAINST CABLE TV LINES.

WE WAIT UP FOR THEM.

WE LEAVE OUR BACK WINDOWS OPEN

AND CALL OUT WHEN WE HEAR A SPLASH.

MORNINGS ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

WITH A TELESCOPE ROD ON COWICHE CREEK
HERE MY ASSURANCE DROPS AWAY. I LOSE

ALL DIRECTION. GRAY LADY

ONTO MOVING WATERS. MY THOUGHTS

STIR LIKE RUFFED GROUSE

IN THE CLEARING ACROSS THE CREEK.

SUDDENLY AS AT A SIGNAL THE BIRDS

PASS SILENTLY BACK INTO PINE TREES.

POEM FOR DR PRATT A LADY PATHOLOGIST
•

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT A PRIEST CAME TO ME

HOLDING IN HIS HANDS WHITE BONES

WHITE BONES IN HIS WHITE HANDS.

HE WAS GENTLE

NOT LIKE FATHER MCCORMICK WITH HIS WEBBED FINGERS.

I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED.

•

THIS AFTERNOON THE MAIDS COME WITH THEIR MOPS

AND DISINFECTANT. THEY PRETEND I’M NOT

THERE TALK OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES AS THEY

PUSH MY BED THIS WAY AND THAT. BEFORE LEAVING

THEY EMBRACE. GRADUALLY THE ROOM

FILLS WITH LEAVES. I AM AFRAID.

•

THE WINDOW IS OPEN. SUNLIGHT.

ACROSS THE ROOM A BED CREAKS CREAKS

UNDER THE WEIGHT OF LOVEMAKING.

THE MAN CLEARS HIS THROAT. OUTSIDE

I HEAR SPRINKLERS. I BEGIN TO VOID.

A GREEN DESK FLOATS BY THE WINDOW.

•

MY HEART LIES ON THE TABLE A PARODY

OF AFFECTION WHILE HER FINGERS RUMMAGE

THE ENDLESS STRING OF ENTRAILS.

THESE CONSIDERATIONS ASIDE

AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF ADVENTURE IN THE FAR EAST

I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE HANDS BUT

I’M COLD BEYOND IMAGINING.

WES HARDIN: FROM A PHOTOGRAPH
TURNING THROUGH A COLLECTION

    OF OLD PHOTOGRAPHS

I COME TO A PICTURE OF THE OUTLAW

    WES HARDIN DEAD.

HE IS A BIG MOUSTACHED MAN

    IN A BLACK SUITCOAT

ON HIS BACK OVER A BOARDFLOOR

    IN AMARILLO TEXAS.

HIS HEAD IS TURNED AT THE CAMERA

    AND HIS FACE

SEEMS BRUISED THE HAIR

    JARRED LOOSE.

A BULLET HAS ENTERED HIS SKULL

    FROM BEHIND

COMING OUT A LITTLE HOLE

    OVER HIS RIGHT EYE.

NOTHING SO FUNNY ABOUT THAT

    BUT THREE SHABBY MEN

IN OVERALLS STAND GRINNING

    A FEW FEET AWAY.

THEY ARE ALL HOLDING RIFLES

    AND THAT ONE

AT THE END HAS ON WHAT MUST BE

    THE OUTLAW’S HAT.

SEVERAL OTHER BULLETS ARE DOTTED

    HERE AND THERE

UNDER THE FANCY WHITE SHIRT

    THE DECEASED IS WEARING

— IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING —

    BUT WHAT MAKES ME STARE

IS THIS LARGE DARK BULLETHOLE

    THROUGH THE SLENDER DELICATE-LOOKING

                                                RIGHT HAND.

MARRIAGE
IN OUR CABIN WE EAT BREADED OYSTERS AND FRIES

WITH LEMON COOKIES FOR DESSERT AS THE MARRIAGE

OF KITTY AND LEVIN UNFOLDS ON PUBLIC TV.

THE MAN IN THE TRAILER UP THE HILL OUR NEIGHBOR

HAS JUST GOTTEN OUT OF JAIL AGAIN.

THIS MORNING HE DROVE INTO THE YARD WITH HIS WIFE

IN A BIG YELLOW CAR RADIO BLARING.

HIS WIFE TURNED OFF THE RADIO WHILE HE PARKED

AND TOGETHER THEY WALKED SLOWLY

TO THEIR TRAILER WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING.

IT WAS EARLY MORNING BIRDS WERE OUT.

LATER HE PROPPED OPEN THE DOOR

WITH A CHAIR TO LET IN SPRING AIR AND LIGHT.

IT’S EASTER SUNDAY NIGHT

AND KITTY AND LEVIN ARE MARRIED AT LAST.

IT’S ENOUGH TO BRING TEARS TO THE EYES THAT MARRIAGE

AND ALL THE LIVES IT TOUCHED. WE GO ON

EATING OYSTERS WATCHING TELEVISION

REMARKING ON THE FINE CLOTHES AND AMAZING GRACE

OF THE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN THIS STORY SOME OF THEM

STRAINING UNDER THE PRESSURES OF ADULTERY

SEPARATION FROM LOVED ONES AND THE DESTRUCTION

THEY MUST KNOW LIES IN STORE JUST AFTER

THE NEXT CRUEL TURN OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN THE NEXT.

A DOG BARKS. I GET UP TO CHECK THE DOOR.

BEHIND THE CURTAINS ARE TRAILERS AND A MUDDY

PARKING AREA WITH CARS. THE MOON SAILS WEST

AS I WATCH ARMED TO THE TEETH HUNTING

FOR MY CHILDREN. MY NEIGHBOR

LIQUORED UP NOW STARTS HIS BIG CAR RACES

THE ENGINE AND HEADS OUT AGAIN FILLED

WITH CONFIDENCE. THE RADIO WAILS

BEATS SOMETHING OUT. WHEN HE HAS GONE

THERE ARE ONLY THE LITTLE PONDS OF SILVER WATER

THAT SHIVER AND CAN’T UNDERSTAND THEIR BEING HERE.

THE OTHER LIFE
NOW FOR THE OTHER LIFE. THE ONE

WITHOUT MISTAKES.

THE MAILMAN AS CANCER PATIENT
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE EACH DAY

THE MAILMAN NEVER SMILES; HE TIRES

EASILY IS LOSING WEIGHT

THAT’S ALL; THEY’LL HOLD THE JOB —

BESIDES HE NEEDED A REST.

HE WILL NOT HEAR IT DISCUSSED.

AS HE WALKS THE EMPTY ROOMS HE

THINKS OF CRAZY THINGS

LIKE TOMMY AND JIMMY DORSEY

SHAKING HANDS WITH FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

AT GRAND COULEE DAM

NEW YEAR’S EVE PARTIES HE LIKED BEST;

ENOUGH THINGS TO FILL A BOOK

HE TELLS HIS WIFE WHO

ALSO THINKS CRAZY THINGS

YET KEEPS ON WORKING.

BUT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT

THE MAILMAN DREAMS HE RISES FROM HIS BED

PUTS ON HIS CLOTHES AND GOES

OUT TREMBLING WITH JOY…

HE HATES THOSE DREAMS

FOR WHEN HE WAKES

THERE’S NOTHING LEFT; IT IS

AS IF HE’D NEVER BEEN

ANYWHERE NEVER DONE ANYTHING;

THERE IS JUST THE ROOM

THE EARLY MORNING WITHOUT SUN

THE SOUND OF A DOORKNOB

TURNING SLOWLY.

TORTURE
FOR STEPHEN DOBYNS

YOU ARE FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN. THIS TIME

IT IS A SOUTH AMERICAN GENERAL’S DAUGHTER.

YOU WANT TO BE STRETCHED ON THE RACK AGAIN.

YOU WANT TO HEAR AWFUL THINGS SAID TO YOU

AND TO ADMIT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE.

YOU WANT TO HAVE UNSPEAKABLE ACTS

COMMITTED AGAINST YOUR PERSON THINGS

NICE PEOPLE DON’T TALK ABOUT IN CLASSROOMS.

YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

ON SIMON BOLIVAR ON JORGE LUIS BORGES

ON YOURSELF MOST OF ALL.

YOU WANT TO IMPLICATE EVERYONE IN THIS!

EVEN WHEN IT’S FOUR O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING

AND THE LIGHTS ARE BURNING STILL —

THOSE LIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN BURNING NIGHT AND DAY

IN YOUR EYES AND BRAIN FOR TWO WEEKS —

AND YOU ARE DYING FOR A SMOKE AND A LEMONADE

BUT SHE WON’T TURN OFF THE LIGHTS THAT WOMAN

WITH THE GREEN EYES AND LITTLE WAYS ABOUT HER

EVEN THEN YOU WANT TO BE HER GAUCHO.

DANCE WITH ME YOU IMAGINE HEARING HER SAY

AS YOU REACH FOR THE EMPTY BEAKER OF WATER.

DANCE WITH ME SHE SAYS AGAIN AND NO MISTAKE.

SHE PICKS THIS MINUTE TO ASK YOU HOMBRE

TO GET UP AND DANCE WITH HER IN THE NUDE.

NO YOU DON’T HAVE THE STRENGTH OF A FALLEN LEAF

NOT THE STRENGTH OF A LITTLE REED BASKET

BATTERED BY WAVES ON LAKE TITICACA.

BUT YOU BOUND OUT OF BED

JUST THE SAME AMIGO YOU DANCE

ACROSS WIDE OPEN SPACES.

WASHINGTON WE FISHED FOR WHITEFISH

IN THE WINTER MONTHS; MY DAD SWEDE —

MR LINDGREN—AND ME. THEY USED BELLY-REELS

PENCIL-LENGTH SINKERS RED YELLOW OR BROWN

FLIES BAITED WITH MAGGOTS.

THEY WANTED DISTANCE AND WENT CLEAR OUT THERE

TO THE EDGE OF THE RIFFLE.

I FISHED NEAR SHORE WITH A QUILL BOBBER AND A CANE POLE.

MY DAD KEPT HIS MAGGOTS ALIVE AND WARM

UNDER HIS LOWER LIP. MR LINDGREN DIDN’T DRINK.

I LIKED HIM BETTER THAN MY DAD FOR A TIME.

HE LET ME STEER HIS CAR TEASED ME

ABOUT MY NAME “JUNIOR” AND SAID

ONE DAY I’D GROW INTO A FINE MAN REMEMBER

ALL THIS AND FISH WITH MY OWN SON.

BUT MY DAD WAS RIGHT. I MEAN

HE KEPT SILENT AND LOOKED INTO THE RIVER

WORKED HIS TONGUE LIKE A THOUGHT BEHIND THE BAIT.

THE COUGAR
FOR JOHN HAINES AND KEITH WILSON

I STALKED A COUGAR ONCE IN A LOST BOX-CANYON

OFF THE COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE NEAR THE TOWN AND RIVER

OF KLICKITAT. WE WERE LOADED FOR GROUSE. OCTOBER

GRAY SKY REACHING OVER INTO OREGON AND BEYOND

ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA. NONE OF US HAD BEEN THERE

TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE KNEW ABOUT THAT PLACE—THEY HAD

RESTAURANTS

THAT LET YOU FILL YOUR PLATE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANTED.

I STALKED A COUGAR THAT DAY

IF STALK IS THE RIGHT WORD CLUMPING AND SCRAPING ALONG

UPWIND OF THE COUGAR SMOKING CIGARETTES TOO

ONE AFTER THE OTHER A NERVOUS FAT SWEATING KID

UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT DAY

I STALKED A COUGAR…

AND THEN I WAS WEAVING DRUNK THERE IN THE LIVING ROOM

FUMBLING TO PUT IT INTO WORDS SMACKED AND SCATTERED

WITH THE MEMORY OF IT AFTER YOU TWO HAD PUT YOUR STORIES

BLACK BEAR STORIES OUT ON THE TABLE.

SUDDENLY I WAS BACK IN THAT CANYON IN THAT GONE STATE.

SOMETHING I HADN’T THOUGHT ABOUT FOR YEARS:

HOW I STALKED A COUGAR THAT DAY.

SO I TOLD IT. TRIED TO ANYWAY

HAINES AND I PRETTY DRUNK NOW. WILSON LISTENING LISTENING

THEN SAYING YOU SURE IT WASN’T A BOBCAT?

WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK AS A PUT-DOWN HE FROM THE SOUTHWEST

POET WHO HAD READ THAT NIGHT

AND ANY FOOL ABLE TO TELL A BOBCAT FROM A COUGAR

EVEN A DRUNK WRITER LIKE ME

YEARS LATER AT THE SMORGASBORD IN CALIFORNIA.

HELL. AND THEN THE COUGAR SMOOTH-LOPED OUT OF THE BRUSH

RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME—GOD HOW BIG AND BEAUTIFUL HE WAS —

JUMPED ONTO A ROCK AND TURNED HIS HEAD

TO LOOK AT ME. TO LOOK AT ME! I LOOKED BACK FORGETTING TO SHOOT.

THEN HE JUMPED AGAIN RAN CLEAR OUT OF MY LIFE.

THE CURRENT
THESE FISH HAVE NO EYES

THESE SILVER FISH THAT COME TO ME IN DREAMS

SCATTERING THEIR ROE AND MILT

IN THE POCKETS OF MY BRAIN.

BUT THERE’S ONE THAT COMES —

HEAVY SCARRED SILENT LIKE THE REST

THAT SIMPLY HOLDS AGAINST THE CURRENT

CLOSING ITS DARK MOUTH AGAINST

THE CURRENT CLOSING AND OPENING

AS IT HOLDS TO THE CURRENT.

HER COOL AND YOUTHFUL EYES STARE AT ME FROM TWO REMAINING

I CAN’T ANSWER. WHO IS TO JUDGE THESE THINGS?

BUT DEEP UNDER MY WINTER UNDERWEAR

MY BLOOD STIRS.

POEM FOR KARL WALLENDA
AERIALIST SUPREME
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE WIND TAILED YOU

ALL OVER MAGDEBURG. IN VIENNA WIND LOOKED FOR YOU

IN FIRST ONE COURTYARD THEN ANOTHER.

IT OVERTURNED FOUNTAINS IT MADE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END.

IN PRAGUE WIND ACCOMPANIED SERIOUS YOUNG COUPLES

JUST STARTING FAMILIES. BUT YOU MADE THEIR BREATHS CATCH

THOSE LADIES IN LONG WHITE DRESSES

THE MEN WITH THEIR MOUSTACHES AND HIGH COLLARS.

IT WAITED IN THE CUFFS OF YOUR SLEEVES

WHEN YOU BOWED TO THE EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE.

IT WAS THERE WHEN YOU SHOOK HANDS

WITH THE DEMOCRATIC KING OF THE BELGIANS.

WIND ROLLED MANGOES AND GARBAGE SACKS DOWN THE STREETS OF NAIROBI.

YOU SAW WIND PURSUING ZEBRAS ACROSS THE SERENGETI PLAIN.

WIND JOINED YOU AS YOU STEPPED OFF THE EAVES OF SUBURBAN HOUSES

IN SARASOTA FLORIDA. IT MADE LITTLE NOISES

IN TREES AT EVERY CROSSROADS TOWN EVERY CIRCUS STOP.

YOU REMARKED ON IT ALL YOUR LIFE

HOW IT COULD COME FROM NOWHERE

HOW IT STIRRED THE PUFFY FACES OF THE HYDRANGEAS

BELOW HOTEL ROOM BALCONIES WHILE YOU

DREW ON YOUR BIG HAVANA AND WATCHED

THE SMOKE STREAM SOUTH ALWAYS SOUTH

TOWARD PUERTO RICO AND THE TORRID ZONE.

THAT MORNING 74 YEARS OLD AND 10 STORIES UP

MIDWAY BETWEEN HOTEL AND HOTEL A PROMOTIONAL STUNT

ON THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING THAT WIND

WHICH HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE WITH YOU

COMES IN FROM THE CARIBBEAN TO THROW ITSELF

ONCE AND FOR ALL INTO YOUR ARMS LIKE A YOUNG LOVER!

YOUR HAIR STANDS ON END.

YOU TRY TO CROUCH TO REACH FOR WIRE.

LATER MEN COME ALONG TO CLEAN UP

AND TO TAKE DOWN THE WIRE. THEY TAKE DOWN THE WIRE

WHERE YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE. IMAGINE THAT: WIRE.

WE SURPRISED A BADGER

THE GARDEN TO THE GARDEN’S STONE WALL.

ALONE AT LAST I SQUAT ON MY HEELS SEE

AFFIX MYSELF TO THE DAMP STONE.

I BEGIN TO LOOK AROUND ME SLOWLY

AND LISTEN EMPLOYING

MY ENTIRE BODY AS THE SNAIL

EMPLOYS ITS BODY RELAXED BUT ALERT.

AMAZING! TONIGHT IS A MILESTONE

IN MY LIFE. AFTER TONIGHT

HOW CAN I EVER GO BACK TO THAT

OTHER LIFE? I KEEP MY EYES

ON THE STARS WAVE TO THEM

WITH MY FEELERS. I HOLD ON

FOR HOURS JUST RESTING.

STILL LATER GRIEF BEGINS TO SETTLE

AROUND MY HEART IN TINY DROPS.

I REMEMBER MY FATHER IS DEAD

AND I AM GOING AWAY FROM THIS

TOWN SOON. FOREVER.

GOODBYE SON MY FATHER SAYS.

TOWARD MORNING I CLIMB DOWN

AS THEY MEET MY NEW EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

WOOLWORTH’S 1954
WHERE THIS FLOATED UP FROM OR WHY

I DON’T KNOW. BUT THINKING ABOUT THIS

SINCE JUST AFTER ROBERT CALLED

TELLING ME HE’D BE HERE IN A FEW

MINUTES TO GO CLAMMING.

HOW ON MY FIRST JOB I WORKED

UNDER A MAN NAMED SOL.

FIFTY-SOME YEARS OLD BUT

A STOCKBOY LIKE I WAS.

HAD WORKED HIS WAY

UP TO NOTHING. BUT GRATEFUL

FOR HIS JOB SAME AS ME.

HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS

TO KNOW ABOUT THAT DIME-STORE

MERCHANDISE AND WAS WILLING

TO SHOW ME. I WAS SIXTEEN WORKING

FOR SIX BITS AN HOUR. LOVING IT

THAT I WAS. SOL TAUGHT ME

WHAT HE KNEW. HE WAS PATIENT

THOUGH IT HELPED I LEARNED FAST.

MOST IMPORTANT MEMORY

OF THAT WHOLE TIME: OPENING

THE CARTONS OF WOMEN’S LINGERIE.

UNDERPANTS AND SOFT CLINGY THINGS

LIKE THAT. TAKING IT OUT

OF CARTONS BY THE HANDFUL. SOMETHING

SWEET AND MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THOSE

THINGS EVEN THEN. SOL CALLED IT

“LINGER-EY.” “LINGER-EY?”

WHAT DID I KNOW? I CALLED IT

THAT FOR A WHILE TOO. “LINGER-EY.”

THEN I GOT OLDER. QUIT BEING

A STOCKBOY. STARTED PRONOUNCING

THAT FROG WORD RIGHT.

I KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!

WENT TO TAKING GIRLS OUT

IN HOPES OF TOUCHING THAT SOFTNESS

SLIPPING DOWN THOSE UNDERPANTS.

AND SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED. GOD

THEY LET ME. AND THEY WERE

LINGER-EY THOSE UNDERPANTS.

THEY TENDED TO LINGER A LITTLE

SOMETIMES AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN

OFF THE BELLY CLINGING LIGHTLY

TO THE HOT WHITE SKIN.

PASSING OVER THE HIPS AND BUTTOCKS

AND BEAUTIFUL THIGHS TRAVELING

FASTER NOW AS THEY CROSSED THE KNEES

THE CALVES! REACHING THE ANKLES

BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR THIS

OCCASION. AND KICKED FREE

ONTO THE FLOOR OF THE CAR AND

FORGOTTEN ABOUT. UNTIL YOU HAD

TO LOOK FOR THEM.

“LINGER-EY.”

THOSE SWEET GIRLS!

“LINGER A LITTLE FOR THOU ART FAIR.”

I KNOW WHO SAID THAT. IT FITS

AND I’LL USE IT. ROBERT AND HIS

KIDS AND I OUT THERE ON THE FLATS

WITH OUR BUCKETS AND SHOVELS.

HIS KIDS WHO WON’T EAT CLAMS CUTTING

UP THE WHOLE TIME SAYING “YUCK”

OR “UGH” AS CLAMS TURNED

UP IN THE SHOVELS FULL OF SAND

AND WERE TOSSED INTO THE BUCKET.

ME THINKING ALL THE WHILE

OF THOSE EARLY DAYS IN YAKIMA.

AND SMOOTH-AS-SILK UNDERPANTS.

THE LINGERING KIND THAT JEANNE WORE

AND RITA MURIEL SUE AND HER SISTER

CORA MAE. ALL THOSE GIRLS.

GROWNUP NOW. OR WORSE.

I’LL SAY IT: DEAD.

RADIO WAVES
FOR ANTONIO MACHADO

  THIS RAIN HAS STOPPED AND THE MOON HAS COME OUT.

I DON’T UNDERSTAND THE FIRST THING ABOUT RADIO

WAVES. BUT I THINK THEY TRAVEL BETTER JUST AFTER

A RAIN WHEN THE AIR IS DAMP. ANYWAY I CAN REACH OUT

NOW AND PICK UP OTTAWA IF I WANT TO OR TORONTO.

LATELY AT NIGHT I’VE FOUND MYSELF

BECOMING SLIGHTLY INTERESTED IN CANADIAN POLITICS

AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. IT’S TRUE. BUT MOSTLY IT WAS THEIR

MUSIC STATIONS I WAS AFTER. I COULD SIT HERE IN THE CHAIR

AND LISTEN WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING OR THINK.

I DON’T HAVE A TV AND I’D QUIT READING

THE PAPERS. AT NIGHT I TURNED ON THE RADIO.

    WHEN I CAME OUT HERE I WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY

FROM EVERYTHING. ESPECIALLY LITERATURE.

WHAT THAT ENTAILS AND WHAT COMES AFTER.

THERE IS IN THE SOUL A DESIRE FOR NOT THINKING.

FOR BEING STILL. COUPLED WITH THIS

A DESIRE TO BE STRICT YES AND RIGOROUS.

BUT THE SOUL IS ALSO A SMOOTH SON OF A BITCH

NOT ALWAYS TRUSTWORTHY. AND I FORGOT THAT.

I LISTENED WHEN IT SAID BETTER TO SING THAT WHICH IS GONE

AND WILL NOT RETURN THAN THAT WHICH IS STILL

WITH US AND WILL BE WITH US TOMORROW. OR NOT.

AND IF NOT THAT’S ALL RIGHT TOO.

IT DIDN’T MUCH MATTER IT SAID IF A MAN SANG AT ALL.

THAT’S THE VOICE I LISTENED TO.

CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY THINKING LIKE THIS?

THAT IT’S REALLY ALL ONE AND THE SAME?

WHAT NONSENSE!

BUT I’D THINK THESE STUPID THOUGHTS AT NIGHT

AS I SAT IN THE CHAIR AND LISTENED TO MY RADIO.

    THEN MACHADO YOUR POETRY!

IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE A MIDDLE-AGED MAN FALLING

IN LOVE AGAIN. A REMARKABLE THING TO WITNESS

AND EMBARRASSING TOO.

SILLY THINGS LIKE PUTTING YOUR PICTURE UP.

AND I TOOK YOUR BOOK TO BED WITH ME

AND SLEPT WITH IT NEAR AT HAND. A TRAIN WENT BY

IN MY DREAMS ONE NIGHT AND WOKE ME UP.

AND THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT HEART RACING

THERE IN THE DARK BEDROOM WAS THIS —

IT’S ALL RIGHT MACHADO IS HERE.

THEN I COULD FALL BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN.

    TODAY I TOOK YOUR BOOK WITH ME WHEN I WENT

FOR MY WALK. “PAY ATTENTION!” YOU SAID

WHEN ANYONE ASKED WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES.

SO I LOOKED AROUND AND MADE NOTE OF EVERYTHING.

THEN SAT DOWN WITH IT IN THE SUN IN MY PLACE

BESIDE THE RIVER WHERE I COULD SEE THE MOUNTAINS.

AND I CLOSED MY EYES AND LISTENED TO THE SOUND

OF THE WATER. THEN I OPENED THEM AND BEGAN TO READ

“ABEL MARTIN’S LAST LAMENTATIONS.”

THIS MORNING I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU HARD MACHADO.

AND I HOPE EVEN IN THE FACE OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT DEATH

THAT YOU GOT THE MESSAGE I INTENDED.

BUT IT’S OKAY EVEN IF YOU DIDN’T. SLEEP WELL. REST.

SOONER OR LATER I HOPE WE’LL MEET.

AND THEN I CAN TELL YOU THESE THINGS MYSELF.

MOVEMENT
DRIVING LICKETY-SPLIT TO MAKE THE FERRY!

SNOW CREEK AND THEN DOG CREEK

FLY BY IN THE HEADLIGHTS.

BUT THE HOUR’S ALL WRONG—NO TIME TO THINK

ABOUT THE SEA-RUN TROUT THERE.

IN THE LEE OF THE MOUNTAINS

SOMETHING ON THE RADIO ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN

WHO TRAVELS AROUND INSIDE A KETTLE.

INDIGENCE IS AT THE ROOT OF OUR LIVES YES

BUT THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

CUT THAT OLD WOMAN SOME SLACK

FOR GOD’S SAKE.

SHE’S SOMEBODY’S MOTHER.

YOU THERE! IT’S LATE. IMAGINE YOURSELF

WITH THE LID COMING DOWN.

THE HYMNS AND REQUIEMS. THE SENSE OF MOVEMENT

AS YOU’RE BORNE ALONG TO THE NEXT PLACE.

HOMINY AND RAIN
IN A LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND BESIDE

THE WALL OF THE EARTH SCIENCES BUILDING

A MAN IN A CANVAS HAT WAS ON

HIS KNEES DOING SOMETHING IN THE RAIN

WITH SOME PLANTS. PIANO MUSIC

CAME FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW

IN THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR. THEN

THE MUSIC STOPPED.

AND THE WINDOW WAS BROUGHT DOWN.

YOU TOLD ME THOSE WHITE BLOSSOMS

ON THE CHERRY TREES IN THE QUAD

SMELLED LIKE A CAN OF JUST-OPENED

HOMINY. HOMINY. THEY REMINDED YOU

OF THAT. THIS MAY OR MAY NOT

BE TRUE. I CAN’T SAY.

I’VE LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL

ALONG WITH ANY INTEREST I MAY EVER

HAVE EXPRESSED IN WORKING

ON MY KNEES WITH PLANTS OR

VEGETABLES. THERE WAS A BAREFOOT

MADMAN WITH A RING IN HIS EAR

PLAYING HIS GUITAR AND SINGING

REGGAE. I REMEMBER THAT.

RAIN PUDDLING AROUND HIS FEET.

THE PLACE HE’D PICKED TO STAND

HAD WELCOME FEAR

PAINTED ON THE SIDEWALK IN RED LETTERS.

AT THE TIME IT SEEMED IMPORTANT

TO RECALL THE MAN ON HIS KNEES

IN FRONT OF HIS PLANTS.

THE BLOSSOMS. MUSIC OF ONE KIND

AND ANOTHER. NOW I’M NOT SO SURE.

I CAN’T SAY FOR SURE.

IT’S A LITTLE LIKE SOME TINY CAVE-IN

IN MY BRAIN. THERE’S A SENSE

THAT I’VE LOST—NOT EVERYTHING

NOT EVERYTHING BUT FAR TOO MUCH.

A PART OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

LIKE HOMINY.

 

EVEN THOUGH YOUR ARM STAYED LINKED

IN MINE. EVEN THOUGH THAT. EVEN

THOUGH WE STOOD QUIETLY IN THE

DOORWAY AS THE RAIN PICKED UP.

AND WATCHED IT WITHOUT SAYING

ANYTHING. STOOD QUIETLY.

AT PEACE I THINK. STOOD WATCHING

THE RAIN. WHILE THE ONE

WITH THE GUITAR PLAYED ON.

THE ROAD
WHAT A ROUGH NIGHT! IT’S EITHER NO DREAMS AT ALL

OR ELSE A DREAM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

A DREAM PORTENDING LOSS. LAST NIGHT I WAS DROPPED OFF

WITHOUT A WORD ON A COUNTRY ROAD.

A HOUSE BACK IN THE HILLS SHOWED A LIGHT

NO BIGGER THAN A STAR.

BUT I WAS AFRAID TO GO THERE AND KEPT WALKING.

THEN TO WAKE UP TO RAIN STRIKING THE GLASS.

FLOWERS IN A VASE NEAR THE WINDOW.

THE SMELL OF COFFEE AND YOU TOUCHING YOUR HAIR

WITH A GESTURE LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN GONE FOR YEARS.

BUT THERE’S A PIECE OF BREAD UNDER THE TABLE

NEAR YOUR FEET. AND A LINE OF ANTS

MOVING BACK AND FORTH FROM A CRACK IN THE FLOOR.

YOU’VE STOPPED SMILING.

DO ME A FAVOR THIS MORNING. DRAW THE CURTAIN AND COME BACK TO BED.

FORGET THE COFFEE. WE’LL PRETEND

WE’RE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND IN LOVE.

FEAR
FEAR OF SEEING A POLICE CAR PULL INTO THE DRIVE.

FEAR OF FALLING ASLEEP AT NIGHT.

FEAR OF NOT FALLING ASLEEP.

FEAR OF THE PAST RISING UP.

FEAR OF THE PRESENT TAKING FLIGHT.

FEAR OF THE TELEPHONE THAT RINGS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.

FEAR OF ELECTRICAL STORMS.

FEAR OF THE CLEANING WOMAN WHO HAS A SPOT ON HER CHEEK!

FEAR OF DOGS I’VE BEEN TOLD WON’T BITE.

FEAR OF ANXIETY!

FEAR OF HAVING TO IDENTIFY THE BODY OF A DEAD FRIEND.

FEAR OF RUNNING OUT OF MONEY.

FEAR OF HAVING TOO MUCH THOUGH PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS.

FEAR OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES.

FEAR OF BEING LATE AND FEAR OF ARRIVING BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

FEAR OF MY CHILDREN’S HANDWRITING ON ENVELOPES.

FEAR THEY’LL DIE BEFORE I DO AND I’LL FEEL GUILTY.

FEAR OF HAVING TO LIVE WITH MY MOTHER IN HER OLD AGE AND MINE.

FEAR OF CONFUSION.

FEAR THIS DAY WILL END ON AN UNHAPPY NOTE.

FEAR OF WAKING UP TO FIND YOU GONE.

FEAR OF NOT LOVING AND FEAR OF NOT LOVING ENOUGH.

FEAR THAT WHAT I LOVE WILL PROVE LETHAL TO THOSE I LOVE.

FEAR OF DEATH.

FEAR OF LIVING TOO LONG.

FEAR OF DEATH.

    I’VE SAID THAT.

ROMANTICISM
(FOR LINDA GREGG
AFTER READING “CLASSICISM”)

THE NIGHTS ARE VERY UNCLEAR HERE.

BUT IF THE MOON IS FULL WE KNOW IT.

WE FEEL ONE THING ONE MINUTE

SOMETHING ELSE THE NEXT.

THE ASHTRAY
YOU COULD WRITE A STORY ABOUT THIS

ASHTRAY FOR EXAMPLE AND A MAN AND A

WOMAN. BUT THE MAN AND WOMAN ARE

ALWAYS THE TWO POLES OF YOUR STORY.

THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH. EVERY

STORY HAS THESE TWO POLES—HE AND SHE.

— A. P. CHEKHOV

THEY’RE ALONE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE IN HER FRIEND’S

APARTMENT. THEY’LL BE ALONE FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND THEN

HER FRIEND WILL BE BACK. OUTSIDE IT’S RAINING —

THE RAIN COMING DOWN LIKE NEEDLES MELTING LAST WEEK’S

SNOW. THEY’RE SMOKING AND USING THE ASHTRAY … MAYBE

JUST ONE OF THEM IS SMOKING…HE’S SMOKING! NEVER

MIND. ANYWAY THE ASHTRAY IS FILLING UP WITH

CIGARETTES AND ASHES.

SHE’S READY TO BREAK INTO TEARS AT ANY MINUTE.

TO PLEAD WITH HIM IN FACT THOUGH SHE’S PROUD

AND HAS NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING IN HER LIFE.

HE SEES WHAT’S COMING RECOGNIZES THE SIGNS —

A CATCH IN HER VOICE AS SHE BRINGS HER FINGERS

TO HER LOCKET THE ONE HER MOTHER LEFT HER.

HE PUSHES BACK HIS CHAIR GETS UP GOES OVER TO

THE WINDOW … HE WISHES IT WERE TOMORROW AND HE

WERE AT THE RACES. HE WISHES HE WAS OUT WALKING

USING HIS UMBRELLA … HE STROKES HIS MUSTACHE

AND WISHES HE WERE ANYWHERE EXCEPT HERE. BUT

HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER. HE’S GOT

TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON THIS FOR EVERYBODY’S SAKE.

GOD KNOWS HE NEVER MEANT FOR THINGS TO COME

TO THIS. BUT IT’S SINK OR SWIM NOW. A WRONG

MOVE AND HE STANDS TO LOSE HER FRIEND TOO.

HER BREATHING SLOWS. SHE WATCHES HIM BUT

DOESN’T SAY ANYTHING. SHE KNOWS OR THINKS SHE

KNOWS WHERE THIS IS LEADING. SHE PASSES A HAND

OVER HER EYES LEANS FORWARD AND PUTS HER HEAD

IN HER HANDS. SHE’S DONE THIS A FEW TIMES

BEFORE BUT HAS NO IDEA IT’S SOMETHING

THAT DRIVES HIM WILD. HE LOOKS AWAY AND GRINDS

HIS TEETH. HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE SHAKES OUT

THE MATCH STANDS A MINUTE LONGER AT THE WINDOW.

THEN WALKS BACK TO THE TABLE AND SITS

DOWN WITH A SIGH. HE DROPS THE MATCH IN THE ASHTRAY.

SHE REACHES FOR HIS HAND AND HE LETS HER

TAKE IT. WHY NOT? WHERE’S THE HARM?

LET HER. HIS MIND’S MADE UP. SHE COVERS HIS

FINGERS WITH KISSES TEARS FALL ONTO HIS WRIST.

HE DRAWS ON HIS CIGARETTE AND LOOKS AT HER

AS A MAN WOULD LOOK INDIFFERENTLY ON

A CLOUD A TREE OR A FIELD OF OATS AT SUNSET.

HE NARROWS HIS EYES AGAINST THE SMOKE. FROM TIME

TO TIME HE USES THE ASHTRAY AS HE WAITS

FOR HER TO FINISH WEEPING.

STILL LOOKING OUT FOR
NUMBER ONE
NOW THAT YOU’VE GONE AWAY FOR FIVE DAYS

I’LL SMOKE ALL THE CIGARETTES I WANT

WHERE I WANT. MAKE BISCUITS AND EAT THEM

WITH JAM AND FAT BACON. LOAF. INDULGE

MYSELF. WALK ON THE BEACH IF I FEEL

LIKE IT. AND I FEEL LIKE IT ALONE AND

THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. THE PEOPLE

THEN WHO LOVED ME BEYOND REASON.

AND HOW I LOVED THEM ABOVE ALL OTHERS.

EXCEPT ONE. I’M SAYING I’LL DO EVERYTHING

I WANT HERE WHILE YOU’RE AWAY!

BUT THERE’S ONE THING I WON’T DO.

I WON’T SLEEP IN OUR BED WITHOUT YOU.

NO. IT DOESN’T PLEASE ME TO DO SO.

I’LL SLEEP WHERE I DAMN WELL FEEL LIKE IT —

WHERE I SLEEP BEST WHEN YOU’RE AWAY

AND I CAN’T HOLD YOU THE WAY I DO.

ON THE BROKEN SOFA IN MY STUDY.

WHERE WATER COMES TOGETHER
WITH OTHER WATER
I LOVE CREEKS AND THE MUSIC THEY MAKE.

AND RILLS IN GLADES AND MEADOWS BEFORE

THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO BECOME CREEKS.

I MAY EVEN LOVE THEM BEST OF ALL

FOR THEIR SECRECY. I ALMOST FORGOT

TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOURCE!

CAN ANYTHING BE MORE WONDERFUL THAN A SPRING?

BUT THE BIG STREAMS HAVE MY HEART TOO.

AND THE PLACES STREAMS FLOW INTO RIVERS.

THE OPEN MOUTHS OF RIVERS WHERE THEY JOIN THE SEA.

THE PLACES WHERE WATER COMES TOGETHER

WITH OTHER WATER. THOSE PLACES STAND OUT

IN MY MIND LIKE HOLY PLACES.

BUT THESE COASTAL RIVERS!

I LOVE THEM THE WAY SOME MEN LOVE HORSES

OR GLAMOROUS WOMEN. I HAVE A THING

FOR THIS COLD SWIFT WATER.

JUST LOOKING AT IT MAKES MY BLOOD RUN

AND MY SKIN TINGLE. I COULD SIT

AND WATCH THESE RIVERS FOR HOURS.

NOT ONE OF THEM LIKE ANY OTHER.

I’M 45 YEARS OLD TODAY.

WOULD ANYONE BELIEVE IT IF I SAID

I WAS ONCE 35?

MY HEART EMPTY AND SERE AT 35!

FIVE MORE YEARS HAD TO PASS

BEFORE IT BEGAN TO FLOW AGAIN.

I’LL TAKE ALL THE TIME I PLEASE THIS AFTERNOON

BEFORE LEAVING MY PLACE ALONGSIDE THIS RIVER.

IT PLEASES ME LOVING RIVERS.

LOVING THEM ALL THE WAY BACK

TO THEIR SOURCE.

LOVING EVERYTHING THAT INCREASES ME.

HAPPINESS
SO EARLY IT’S STILL ALMOST DARK OUT.

I’M NEAR THE WINDOW WITH COFFEE

AND THE USUAL EARLY MORNING STUFF

THAT PASSES FOR THOUGHT.

WHEN I SEE THE BOY AND HIS FRIEND

WALKING UP THE ROAD

TO DELIVER THE NEWSPAPER.

THEY WEAR CAPS AND SWEATERS

AND ONE BOY HAS A BAG OVER HIS SHOULDER.

THEY ARE SO HAPPY

THEY AREN’T SAYING ANYTHING THESE BOYS.

I THINK IF THEY COULD THEY WOULD TAKE

EACH OTHER’S ARM.

IT’S EARLY IN THE MORNING

AND THEY ARE DOING THIS THING TOGETHER.

THEY COME ON SLOWLY.

THE SKY IS TAKING ON LIGHT

THOUGH THE MOON STILL HANGS PALE OVER THE WATER.

SUCH BEAUTY THAT FOR A MINUTE

DEATH AND AMBITION EVEN LOVE

DOESN’T ENTER INTO THIS.

HAPPINESS. IT COMES ON

UNEXPECTEDLY. AND GOES BEYOND REALLY

ANY EARLY MORNING TALK ABOUT IT.

THE OLD DAYS
YOU’D DOZED IN FRONT OF THE TV

BUT YOU HADN’T BEEN TO BED YET

WHEN YOU CALLED. I WAS ASLEEP

OR NEARLY WHEN THE PHONE RANG.

YOU WANTED TO TELL ME YOU’D THROWN

A PARTY. AND I WAS MISSED.

IT WAS LIKE THE OLD DAYS YOU

SAID AND LAUGHED.

DINNER WAS A DISASTER.

EVERYBODY DEAD DRUNK BY THE TIME

FOOD HIT THE TABLE. PEOPLE

WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME A GREAT

TIME A HELL OF A TIME UNTIL

SOMEBODY TOOK SOMEBODY

ELSE’S FIANCÉE UPSTAIRS. THEN

SOMEBODY PULLED A KNIFE.

BUT YOU GOT IN FRONT OF THE GUY

AS HE WAS GOING UPSTAIRS

AND TALKED HIM DOWN.

DISASTER NARROWLY AVERTED

YOU SAID AND LAUGHED AGAIN.

YOU DIDN’T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE

OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.

PEOPLE GOT INTO THEIR COATS

AND BEGAN TO LEAVE. YOU

MUST HAVE DROPPED OFF FOR A FEW

MINUTES IN FRONT OF THE TV

BECAUSE IT WAS SCREAMING AT YOU

TO GET IT A DRINK WHEN YOU WOKE UP.

ANYWAY YOU’RE IN PITTSBURGH

AND I’M IN HERE IN THIS

LITTLE TOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE

OF THE COUNTRY. MOST EVERYONE

HAS CLEARED OUT OF OUR LIVES NOW.

YOU WANTED TO CALL ME UP AND SAY HELLO.

TO SAY YOU WERE THINKING

ABOUT ME AND OF THE OLD DAYS.

TO SAY YOU WERE MISSING ME.

IT WAS THEN I REMEMBERED

BACK TO THOSE DAYS AND HOW

TELEPHONES USED TO JUMP WHEN THEY RANG.

AND THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME

IN THOSE EARLY-MORNING HOURS

TO POUND ON THE DOOR IN ALARM.

NEVER MIND THE ALARM FELT INSIDE.

I REMEMBERED THAT AND GRAVY DINNERS.

KNIVES LYING AROUND WAITING

FOR TROUBLE. GOING TO BED

AND HOPING I WOULDN’T WAKE UP.

I LOVE YOU BRO YOU SAID.

AND THEN A SOB PASSED

BETWEEN US. I TOOK HOLD

OF THE RECEIVER AS IF

IT WERE MY BUDDY’S ARM.

AND I WISHED FOR US BOTH

I COULD PUT MY ARMS

AROUND YOU OLD FRIEND.

I LOVE YOU TOO BRO.

I SAID THAT AND THEN WE HUNG UP.

OUR FIRST HOUSE IN SACRAMENTO
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR TO ME NOW—EVEN THEN

OUR DAYS WERE NUMBERED. AFTER OUR FIRST WEEK

IN THE HOUSE THAT CAME FURNISHED

WITH SOMEBODY ELSE’S THINGS A MAN APPEARED

ONE NIGHT WITH A BASEBALL BAT. AND RAISED IT.

I WAS NOT THE MAN HE THOUGHT I WAS.

FINALLY I GOT HIM TO BELIEVE IT.

HE WEPT FROM FRUSTRATION AFTER HIS ANGER

LEFT HIM. NONE OF THIS HAD ANYTHING TO DO

WITH BEATLEMANIA. THE NEXT WEEK THESE FRIENDS

OF OURS FROM THE BAR WHERE WE ALL DRANK

BROUGHT FRIENDS OF THEIRS TO OUR HOUSE —

AND WE PLAYED POKER. I LOST THE GROCERY MONEY

TO A STRANGER. WHO WENT ON TO QUARREL

WITH HIS WIFE. IN HIS FRUSTRATION

HE DROVE HIS FIST THROUGH THE KITCHEN WALL.

THEN HE TOO DISAPPEARED FROM MY LIFE FOREVER.

WHEN WE LEFT THAT HOUSE WHERE NOTHING WORKED

ANY LONGER WE LEFT AT MIDNIGHT

WITH A U-HAUL TRAILER AND A LANTERN.

WHO KNOWS WHAT PASSED THROUGH THE NEIGHBORS’ MINDS

WHEN THEY SAW A FAMILY LEAVING THEIR HOUSE

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

THE LANTERN MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAINLESS

WINDOWS. THE SHADOWS GOING FROM ROOM TO ROOM

GATHERING THEIR THINGS INTO BOXES.

I SAW FIRSTHAND

WHAT FRUSTRATION CAN DO TO A MAN.

MAKE HIM WEEP MAKE HIM THROW HIS FIST

THROUGH A WALL. SET HIM TO DREAMING

OF THE HOUSE THAT’S HIS

AT THE END OF THE LONG ROAD. A HOUSE

FILLED WITH MUSIC EASE AND GENEROSITY.

A HOUSE THAT HASN’T BEEN LIVED IN YET.

NEXT YEAR
THAT FIRST WEEK IN SANTA BARBARA WASN’T THE WORST THING

TO HAPPEN. THE SECOND WEEK HE FELL ON HIS HEAD

WHILE DRINKING JUST BEFORE HE HAD TO LECTURE.

IN THE LOUNGE THAT SECOND WEEK SHE TOOK THE MICROPHONE

FROM THE SINGER’S HANDS AND CROONED HER OWN

TORCH SONG. THEN DANCED. AND THEN PASSED OUT

ON THE TABLE. THAT’S NOT THE WORST EITHER. THEY

WENT TO JAIL THAT SECOND WEEK. HE WASN’T DRIVING

SO THEY BOOKED HIM DRESSED HIM IN PAJAMAS

AND STUCK HIM IN DETOX. TOLD HIM TO GET SOME SLEEP.

TOLD HIM HE COULD SEE ABOUT HIS WIFE IN THE MORNING.

BUT HOW COULD HE SLEEP WHEN THEY WOULDN’T LET HIM

CLOSE THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM?

THE CORRIDOR’S GREEN LIGHT ENTERED

AND THE SOUND OF A MAN WEEPING.

HIS WIFE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO GIVE THE ALPHABET

BESIDE THE ROAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

THIS IS STRANGE ENOUGH. BUT THE COPS HAD HER

STAND ON ONE LEG CLOSE HER EYES

AND TRY TO TOUCH HER NOSE WITH HER INDEX FINGER.

ALL OF WHICH SHE FAILED TO DO.

SHE WENT TO JAIL FOR RESISTING ARREST.

HE BAILED HER OUT WHEN HE GOT OUT OF DETOX.

THEY DROVE HOME IN RUINS.

THIS IS NOT THE WORST. THEIR DAUGHTER HAD PICKED THAT NIGHT

TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME. SHE LEFT A NOTE:

“YOU’RE BOTH CRAZY. GIVE ME A BREAK PLEASE.

DON’T COME AFTER ME.”

THAT’S STILL NOT THE WORST. THEY WENT ON

THINKING THEY WERE THE PEOPLE THEY SAID THEY WERE.

ANSWERING TO THOSE NAMES.

MAKING LOVE TO THE PEOPLE WITH THOSE NAMES.

NIGHTS WITHOUT BEGINNING THAT HAD NO END.

TALKING ABOUT A PAST AS IF IT’D REALLY HAPPENED.

TELLING THEMSELVES THAT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR

THIS TIME NEXT YEAR

THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

TO MY DAUGHTER
EVERYTHING I SEE WILL OUTLIVE ME.

— ANNA AKHMATOVA

IT’S TOO LATE NOW TO PUT A CURSE ON YOU—WISH YOU

PLAIN SAY AS YEATS DID HIS DAUGHTER. AND WHEN

WE MET HER IN SLIGO SELLING HER PAINTINGS IT’D WORKED —

SHE WAS THE PLAINEST OLDEST WOMAN IN IRELAND.

BUT SHE WAS SAFE.

FOR THE LONGEST TIME HIS REASONING

ESCAPED ME. ANYWAY IT’S TOO LATE FOR YOU

AS I SAID. YOU’RE GROWNUP NOW AND LOVELY.

YOU’RE A BEAUTIFUL DRUNK DAUGHTER.

BUT YOU’RE A DRUNK. I CAN’T SAY YOU’RE BREAKING

MY HEART. I DON’T HAVE A HEART WHEN IT COMES

TO THIS BOOZE THING. SAD YES CHRIST ALONE KNOWS.

YOUR OLD MAN THE ONE THEY CALL SHILOH IS BACK

IN TOWN AND THE DRINK HAS STARTED TO FLOW AGAIN.

YOU’VE BEEN DRUNK FOR THREE DAYS YOU TELL ME

WHEN YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL DRINKING IS LIKE POISON

TO OUR FAMILY. DIDN’T YOUR MOTHER AND I SET YOU

EXAMPLE ENOUGH? TWO PEOPLE

WHO LOVED EACH OTHER KNOCKING EACH OTHER AROUND

KNOCKING BACK THE LOVE WE FELT GLASS BY EMPTY GLASS

CURSES AND BLOWS AND BETRAYALS?

YOU MUST BE CRAZY! WASN’T ALL THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

YOU WANT TO DIE? MAYBE THAT’S IT. MAYBE

I THINK I KNOW YOU AND I DON’T.

I’M NOT KIDDING KIDDO. WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

DAUGHTER YOU CAN’T DRINK.

THE LAST FEW TIMES I SAW YOU YOU WERE OUT OF IT.

A CAST ON YOUR COLLARBONE OR ELSE

A SPLINT ON YOUR FINGER DARK GLASSES TO HIDE

YOUR BEAUTIFUL BRUISED EYES. A LIP

THAT A MAN SHOULD KISS INSTEAD OF SPLIT.

OH JESUS JESUS JESUS CHRIST!

YOU’VE GOT TO TAKE HOLD NOW.

DO YOU HEAR ME? WAKE UP! YOU’VE GOT TO KNOCK IT OFF

AND GET STRAIGHT. CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. I’M ASKING YOU.

OKAY TELLING YOU. SURE OUR FAMILY WAS MADE

TO SQUANDER NOT COLLECT. BUT TURN THIS AROUND NOW.

YOU SIMPLY MUST—THAT’S ALL!

DAUGHTER YOU CAN’T DRINK.

IT WILL KILL YOU. LIKE IT DID YOUR MOTHER AND ME.

LIKE IT DID.

ANATHEMA
THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SUFFERED.

MY WIFE MYSELF THE TWO CHILDREN AND THE DOG

WHOSE PUPPIES WERE BORN DEAD.

OUR AFFAIRS SUCH AS THEY WERE WITHERED.

MY WIFE WAS DROPPED BY HER LOVER

THE ONE-ARMED TEACHER OF MUSIC WHO WAS

HER ONLY CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

AND THE THINGS OF THE MIND.

MY OWN GIRLFRIEND SAID SHE COULDN’T STAND IT

ANYMORE AND WENT BACK TO HER HUSBAND.

THE WATER WAS SHUT OFF.

ALL THAT SUMMER THE HOUSE BAKED.

THE PEACH TREES WERE BLASTED.

OUR LITTLE FLOWER BED LAY TRAMPLED.

THE BRAKES WENT OUT ON THE CAR AND THE BATTERY

FAILED. THE NEIGHBORS QUIT SPEAKING

TO US AND CLOSED THEIR DOORS IN OUR FACES.

CHECKS FLEW BACK AT US FROM MERCHANTS —

AND THEN MAIL STOPPED BEING DELIVERED

ALTOGETHER. ONLY THE SHERIFF GOT THROUGH

FROM TIME TO TIME—WITH ONE OR THE OTHER

OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT

PLEADING TO BE TAKEN ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

AND THEN MICE ENTERED THE HOUSE IN DROVES.

FOLLOWED BY A BULL SNAKE. MY WIFE

FOUND IT SUNNING ITSELF IN THE LIVING ROOM

NEXT TO THE DEAD TV. HOW SHE DEALT WITH IT

IS ANOTHER MATTER. CHOPPED ITS HEAD OFF

RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR.

AND THEN CHOPPED IT IN TWO WHEN IT CONTINUED

TO WRITHE. WE SAW WE COULDN’T HOLD OUT

ANY LONGER. WE WERE BEATEN.

WE WANTED TO GET DOWN ON OUR KNEES

AND SAY FORGIVE US OUR SINS FORGIVE US

OUR LIVES. BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

TOO LATE. NO ONE AROUND WOULD LISTEN.

WE HAD TO WATCH AS THE HOUSE WAS PULLED DOWN

THE GROUND PLOWED UP AND THEN

WE WERE DISPERSED IN FOUR DIRECTIONS.

ENERGY
LAST NIGHT AT MY DAUGHTER’S NEAR BLAINE

SHE DID HER BEST TO TELL ME

WHAT WENT WRONG

BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND ME.

“ENERGY. YOU TWO’S ENERGY WAS ALL WRONG.”

SHE LOOKS LIKE HER MOTHER

WHEN HER MOTHER WAS YOUNG.

LAUGHS LIKE HER.

MOVES THE DRIFT OF HAIR

FROM HER FOREHEAD LIKE HER MOTHER.

CAN TAKE A CIGARETTE DOWN

TO THE FILTER IN THREE DRAWS

JUST LIKE HER MOTHER. I THOUGHT

THIS VISIT WOULD BE EASY. WRONG.

THIS IS HARD BROTHER. THOSE YEARS

SPILLING OVER INTO MY SLEEP WHEN I TRY

TO SLEEP. TO WAKE TO FIND A THOUSAND

CIGARETTES IN THE ASHTRAY AND EVERY

LIGHT IN THE HOUSE BURNING. I CAN’T

PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING:

TODAY I’LL BE CARRIED

THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY INTO

THE LOVING ARMS OF ANOTHER WOMAN NOT

HER MOTHER. NO. SHE’S CAUGHT

IN THE FLYWHEEL OF A NEW LOVE.

I TURN OFF THE LAST LIGHT

AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

MOVING TOWARD WHATEVER ANCIENT THING

IT IS THAT WORKS THE CHAINS

AND PULLS US SO RELENTLESSLY ON.

LOCKING YOURSELF OUT
THEN TRYING TO GET BACK IN
YOU SIMPLY GO OUT AND SHUT THE DOOR

WITHOUT THINKING. AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK

AT WHAT YOU’VE DONE

IT’S TOO LATE. IF THIS SOUNDS

LIKE THE STORY OF A LIFE OKAY.

IT WAS RAINING. THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD

A KEY WERE AWAY. I TRIED AND TRIED

THE LOWER WINDOWS. STARED

INSIDE AT THE SOFA PLANTS THE TABLE

AND CHAIRS THE STEREO SET-UP.

MY COFFEE CUP AND ASHTRAY WAITED FOR ME

ON THE GLASS-TOPPED TABLE AND MY HEART

WENT OUT TO THEM. I SAID HELLO FRIENDS

OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AFTER ALL

THIS WASN’T SO BAD.

WORSE THINGS HAD HAPPENED. THIS

WAS EVEN A LITTLE FUNNY. I FOUND THE LADDER.

TOOK THAT AND LEANED IT AGAINST THE HOUSE.

THEN CLIMBED IN THE RAIN TO THE DECK

SWUNG MYSELF OVER THE RAILING

AND TRIED THE DOOR. WHICH WAS LOCKED

OF COURSE. BUT I LOOKED IN JUST THE SAME

AT MY DESK SOME PAPERS AND MY CHAIR.

THIS WAS THE WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE

OF THE DESK WHERE I’D RAISE MY EYES

AND STARE OUT WHEN I SAT AT THAT DESK.

THIS IS NOT LIKE DOWNSTAIRS I THOUGHT.

THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.

AND IT WAS SOMETHING TO LOOK IN LIKE THAT UNSEEN

FROM THE DECK. TO BE THERE INSIDE AND NOT BE THERE.

I DON’T EVEN THINK I CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

I BROUGHT MY FACE CLOSE TO THE GLASS

AND IMAGINED MYSELF INSIDE

SITTING AT THE DESK. LOOKING UP

FROM MY WORK NOW AND AGAIN.

THINKING ABOUT SOME OTHER PLACE

AND SOME OTHER TIME.

THE PEOPLE I HAD LOVED THEN.

I STOOD THERE FOR A MINUTE IN THE RAIN.

CONSIDERING MYSELF TO BE THE LUCKIEST OF MEN.

EVEN THOUGH A WAVE OF GRIEF PASSED THROUGH ME.

EVEN THOUGH I FELT VIOLENTLY ASHAMED

OF THE INJURY I’D DONE BACK THEN.

I BASHED THAT BEAUTIFUL WINDOW.

AND STEPPED BACK IN.

MEDICINE
ALL I KNOW ABOUT MEDICINE I PICKED UP

FROM MY DOCTOR FRIEND IN EL PASO

WHO DRANK AND TOOK DRUGS. WE WERE BUDDIES

UNTIL I MOVED EAST. I’M SAYING

I WAS NEVER SICK A DAY IN MY LIFE.

BUT SOMETHING HAS APPEARED

ON MY SHOULDER AND CONTINUES TO GROW.

A WEN I THINK AND LOVE THE WORD

BUT NOT THE THING ITSELF WHATEVER

IT IS. LATE AT NIGHT MY TEETH ACHE

AND THE PHONE RINGS. I’M ILL

UNHAPPY AND ALONE. LORD!

GIVE ME YOUR UNSTEADY KNIFE

DOC. GIVE ME YOUR HAND FRIEND.

WENAS RIDGE
THE SEASONS TURNING. MEMORY FLARING.

THREE OF US THAT FALL. YOUNG HOODLUMS —

SHOPLIFTERS STEALERS OF HUBCAPS.

BOZOS. DICK MILLER DEAD NOW.

LYLE ROUSSEAU SON OF THE FORD DEALER.

AND I WHO’D JUST MADE A GIRL PREGNANT.

HUNTING LATE INTO THAT GOLDEN AFTERNOON

FOR GROUSE. FOLLOWING DEER PATHS

PUSHING THROUGH UNDERGROWTH STEPPING OVER

BLOW-DOWNS. REACHING OUT FOR SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO.

AT THE TOP OF WENAS RIDGE

WE WALKED OUT OF PINE TREES AND COULD SEE

DOWN DEEP RAVINES WHERE THE WIND ROARED TO THE RIVER.

MORE ALIVE THEN I THOUGHT THAN I’D EVER BE.

BUT MY WHOLE LIFE IN SWITCHBACKS AHEAD OF ME.

HAWKS DEER COONS WE LOOKED AT AND LET GO.

KILLED SIX GROUSE AND SHOULD HAVE STOPPED.

DIDN’T THOUGH WE HAD LIMITS.

LYLE AND I CLIMBING FIFTY FEET OR SO

ABOVE DICK MILLER. WHO SCREAMED—“YAAAAH!”

THEN SWORE AND SWORE. LEGS NUMBING AS I SAW WHAT.

THAT FAT DARK SNAKE RISING UP. BEGINNING TO SING.

AND HOW IT SANG! A TIMBER RATTLER THICK AS MY WRIST.

IT’D STRUCK AT MILLER BUT MISSED. NO OTHER WAY

TO SAY IT—HE WAS PARALYZED. COULD SCREAM AND SWEAR

NOT SHOOT. THEN THE SNAKE LOWERED ITSELF FROM SIGHT

AND WENT IN UNDER ROCKS. WE UNDERSTOOD

WE’D HAVE TO GET DOWN. IN THE SAME WAY WE’D GOT UP.

BLINDLY CRAWLING THROUGH BRUSH STEPPING OVER BLOW-DOWNS

PUSHING INTO UNDERGROWTH. SHADOWS FALLING FROM TREES NOW

ONTO FLAT ROCKS THAT HELD THE DAY’S HEAT. AND SNAKES.

MY HEART STOPPED AND THEN STARTED AGAIN.

MY HAIR STOOD ON END. THIS WAS THE MOMENT

MY LIFE HAD PREPARED ME FOR. AND I WASN’T READY.

WE STARTED DOWN ANYWAY. JESUS PLEASE HELP ME

OUT OF THIS I PRAYED. I’LL BELIEVE IN YOU AGAIN

AND HONOR YOU ALWAYS. BUT JESUS WAS CROWDED OUT

OF MY HEAD BY THE VISION OF THAT REARING SNAKE.

THAT SINGING. KEEP BELIEVING IN ME SNAKE SAID

FOR I WILL RETURN. I MADE AN OBSCURE CRIMINAL PACT

THAT DAY. PRAYING TO JESUS IN ONE BREATH.

TO SNAKE IN THE OTHER. SNAKE FINALLY MORE REAL

TO ME. THE MEMORY OF THAT DAY

LIKE A BLOW TO THE CALF NOW.

I GOT OUT DIDN’T I? BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED.

I MARRIED THE GIRL I LOVED YET POISONED HER LIFE.

LIES BEGAN TO COIL IN MY HEART AND CALL IT HOME.

GOT USED TO DARKNESS AND ITS CROOKED WAYS.

SINCE THEN I’VE ALWAYS FEARED RATTLESNAKES.

BEEN AMBIVALENT ABOUT JESUS.

BUT SOMEONE SOMETHING’S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

NOW AS THEN.

READING
EVERY MAN’S LIFE IS A MYSTERY EVEN AS

YOURS IS AND MINE. IMAGINE

A CHÂTEAU WITH A WINDOW OPENING

ONTO LAKE GENEVA. THERE IN THE WINDOW

ON WARM AND SUNNY DAYS IS A MAN

SO ENGROSSED IN READING HE DOESN’T LOOK

UP. OR IF HE DOES HE MARKS HIS PLACE

WITH A FINGER RAISES HIS EYES AND PEERS

ACROSS THE WATER TO MONT BLANC

AND BEYOND TO SELAH WASHINGTON

WHERE HE IS WITH A GIRL

AND GETTING DRUNK FOR THE FIRST TIME.

THE LAST THING HE REMEMBERS BEFORE

HE PASSES OUT IS THAT SHE SPIT ON HIM.

HE KEEPS ON DRINKING

AND GETTING SPIT ON FOR YEARS.

BUT SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU

THAT SUFFERING IS GOOD FOR THE CHARACTER.

YOU’RE FREE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING.

IN ANY CASE HE GOES

BACK TO READING AND WILL NOT

FEEL GUILTY ABOUT HIS MOTHER

DRIFTING IN HER BOAT OF SADNESS

OR CONSIDER HIS CHILDREN

AND THEIR TROUBLES THAT GO ON AND ON.

NOR DOES HE INTEND TO THINK ABOUT

THE CLEAR-EYED WOMAN HE ONCE LOVED

AND HER DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF EASTERN RELIGION.

HER GRIEF HAS NO BEGINNING AND NO END.

LET ANYONE IN THE CHÂTEAU OR SELAH

COME FORWARD WHO MIGHT CLAIM KIN WITH THE MAN

WHO SITS ALL DAY IN THE WINDOW READING

LIKE A PICTURE OF A MAN READING.

LET THE SUN COME FORWARD.

LET THE MAN HIMSELF COME FORWARD.

WHAT IN HELL CAN HE BE READING?

RAIN
WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH

A TERRIFIC URGE TO LIE IN BED ALL DAY

AND READ. FOUGHT AGAINST IT FOR A MINUTE.

THEN LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE RAIN.

AND GAVE OVER. PUT MYSELF ENTIRELY

IN THE KEEP OF THIS RAINY MORNING.

WOULD I LIVE MY LIFE OVER AGAIN?

MAKE THE SAME UNFORGIVABLE MISTAKES?

YES GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. YES.

MONEY
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LIVE

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW.

TO ALWAYS USE HIS OWN NAME

AND PHONE NUMBER. TO GO BAIL

FOR A FRIEND AND NOT GIVE

A DAMN IF THE FRIEND SKIPS TOWN.

HOPE IN FACT SHE DOES.

TO GIVE SOME MONEY

TO HIS MOTHER. AND TO HIS

CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHER.

NOT SAVE IT. HE WANTS

TO USE IT UP BEFORE IT’S GONE.

BUY CLOTHES WITH IT.

PAY THE RENT AND UTILITIES.

BUY FOOD AND THEN SOME.

GO OUT FOR DINNER WHEN HE FEELS LIKE IT.

AND IT’S OKAY

TO ORDER ANYTHING OFF THE MENU!

BUY DRUGS WHEN HE WANTS.

BUY A CAR. IF IT BREAKS

DOWN REPAIR IT. OR ELSE

BUY ANOTHER. SEE THAT

BOAT? HE MIGHT BUY ONE

JUST LIKE IT. AND SAIL IT

AROUND THE HORN LOOKING

FOR COMPANY. HE KNOWS A GIRL

IN PORTO ALEGRE WHO’D LOVE

TO SEE HIM IN

HIS OWN BOAT SAILS FULL

TURN INTO THE HARBOR FOR HER.

A FELLOW WHO COULD AFFORD

TO COME ALL THIS WAY

TO SEE HER. JUST BECAUSE

HE LIKED THE SOUND

OF HER LAUGHTER

AND THE WAY SHE SWINGS HER HAIR.

ASPENS
IMAGINE A YOUNG MAN ALONE WITHOUT ANYONE.

THE MOMENT A FEW RAINDROPS STREAKED HIS GLASS

HE BEGAN TO SCRIBBLE.

HE LIVED IN A TENEMENT WITH MICE FOR COMPANY.

I LOVED HIS BRAVERY.

SOMEONE ELSE A FEW DOORS DOWN

PLAYED SEGOVIA RECORDS ALL DAY.

HE NEVER LEFT HIS ROOM AND NO ONE COULD BLAME HIM.

AT NIGHT HE COULD HEAR THE OTHER’S

TYPEWRITER GOING AND FEEL COMFORTED.

LITERATURE AND MUSIC.

EVERYONE DREAMING OF SPANISH HORSEMEN

AND COURTYARDS.

PROCESSIONS. CEREMONY AND

RESPLENDENCE.

ASPEN TREES.

DAYS OF RAIN AND HIGH WATER.

LEAVES HAMMERED INTO THE GROUND FINALLY.

IN MY HEART THIS PLOT OF EARTH

THAT THE STORM LIGHTS.

AT LEAST
I WANT TO GET UP EARLY ONE MORE MORNING

BEFORE SUNRISE. BEFORE THE BIRDS EVEN.

I WANT TO THROW COLD WATER ON MY FACE

AND BE AT MY WORK TABLE

WHEN THE SKY LIGHTENS AND SMOKE

BEGINS TO RISE FROM THE CHIMNEYS

OF THE OTHER HOUSES.

I WANT TO SEE THE WAVES BREAK

ON THIS ROCKY BEACH NOT JUST HEAR THEM

BREAK AS I DID ALL NIGHT IN MY SLEEP.

I WANT TO SEE AGAIN THE SHIPS

THAT PASS THROUGH THE STRAIT FROM EVERY

SEAFARING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD —

OLD DIRTY FREIGHTERS JUST BARELY MOVING ALONG

AND THE SWIFT NEW CARGO VESSELS

PAINTED EVERY COLOR UNDER THE SUN

THAT CUT THE WATER AS THEY PASS.

I WANT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM.

AND FOR THE LITTLE BOAT THAT PLIES

THE WATER BETWEEN THE SHIPS

AND THE PILOT STATION NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE.

I WANT TO SEE THEM TAKE A MAN OFF THE SHIP

AND PUT ANOTHER UP ON BOARD.

I WANT TO SPEND THE DAY WATCHING THIS HAPPEN

AND REACH MY OWN CONCLUSIONS.

I HATE TO SEEM GREEDY—I HAVE SO MUCH

TO BE THANKFUL FOR ALREADY.

BUT I WANT TO GET UP EARLY ONE MORE MORNING AT LEAST.

AND GO TO MY PLACE WITH SOME COFFEE AND WAIT.

JUST WAIT TO SEE WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN.

THE GRANT
IT’S EITHER THIS OR BOBCAT HUNTING

WITH MY FRIEND MORRIS.

TRYING TO WRITE A POEM AT SIX THIS

MORNING OR ELSE RUNNING

BEHIND THE HOUNDS WITH

A RIFLE IN MY HANDS.

HEART JUMPING IN ITS CAGE.

I’M 45 YEARS OLD. NO OCCUPATION.

IMAGINE THE LUXURIOUSNESS OF THIS LIFE.

TRY AND IMAGINE.

MAY GO WITH HIM IF HE GOES

TOMORROW. BUT MAY NOT.

MY BOAT
MY BOAT IS BEING MADE TO ORDER. RIGHT NOW IT’S ABOUT TO LEAVE

THE HANDS OF ITS BUILDERS. I’VE RESERVED A SPECIAL PLACE

FOR IT DOWN AT THE MARINA. IT’S GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM

ON IT FOR ALL MY FRIENDS: RICHARD BILL CHUCK TOBY JIM HAYDEN

GARY GEORGE HAROLD DON DICK SCOTT GEOFFREY JACK

PAUL JAY MORRIS AND ALFREDO. ALL MY FRIENDS! THEY KNOW WHO

THEY ARE.

TESS OF COURSE. I WOULDN’T GO ANYPLACE WITHOUT HER.

AND KRISTINA MERRY CATHERINE DIANE SALLY ANNICK PAT

JUDITH SUSIE LYNNE ANNIE JANE MONA.

DOUG AND AMY! THEY’RE FAMILY BUT THEY’RE ALSO MY FRIENDS

AND THEY LIKE A GOOD TIME. THERE’S ROOM ON MY BOAT

FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYONE. I’M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS!

THERE’LL BE A PLACE ON BOARD FOR EVERYONE’S STORIES.

MY OWN BUT ALSO THE ONES BELONGING TO MY FRIENDS.

SHORT STORIES AND THE ONES THAT GO ON AND ON. THE TRUE

AND THE MADE-UP. THE ONES ALREADY FINISHED AND THE ONES STILL

BEING WRITTEN.

POEMS TOO! LYRIC POEMS AND THE LONGER DARKER NARRATIVES.

FOR MY PAINTER FRIENDS PAINTS AND CANVASES WILL BE ON BOARD

MY BOAT.

WE’LL HAVE FRIED CHICKEN LUNCH MEATS CHEESES ROLLS

FRENCH BREAD. EVERY GOOD THING THAT MY FRIENDS AND I LIKE.

AND A BIG BASKET OF FRUIT IN CASE ANYONE WANTS FRUIT.

IN CASE ANYONE WANTS TO SAY HE OR SHE ATE AN APPLE

OR SOME GRAPES ON MY BOAT. WHATEVER MY FRIENDS WANT

NAME IT AND IT’LL BE THERE. SODA POP OF ALL KINDS.

BEER AND WINE SURE. NO ONE WILL BE DENIED ANYTHING ON

MY BOAT.

WE’LL GO OUT INTO THE SUNNY HARBOR AND HAVE FUN THAT’S THE IDEA.

JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME ALL AROUND. NOT THINKING

ABOUT THIS OR THAT OR GETTING AHEAD OR FALLING BEHIND.

FISHING POLES IF ANYONE WANTS TO FISH. THE FISH ARE OUT THERE!

WE MAY EVEN GO A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE COAST ON MY BOAT.

BUT NOTHING DANGEROUS NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TO ENJOY OURSELVES AND NOT GET SCARED.

WE’LL EAT AND DRINK AND LAUGH A LOT ON MY BOAT.

I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TRIP LIKE THIS

WITH MY FRIENDS ON MY BOAT. IF WE WANT TO

WE’LL LISTEN TO SCHUMANN ON THE CBC.

BUT IF THAT DOESN’T WORK OUT OKAY

WE’LL SWITCH TO KRAB THE WHO AND THE ROLLING STONES.

WHATEVER MAKES MY FRIENDS HAPPY! MAYBE EVERYONE

WILL HAVE THEIR OWN RADIO ON MY BOAT. IN ANY CASE

WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG TIME. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN

AND DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO ON MY BOAT.

THE POEM I DIDN’T WRITE
HERE IS THE POEM I WAS GOING TO WRITE

EARLIER BUT DIDN’T

BECAUSE I HEARD YOU STIRRING.

I WAS THINKING AGAIN

ABOUT THAT FIRST MORNING IN ZURICH.

HOW WE WOKE UP BEFORE SUNRISE.

DISORIENTED FOR A MINUTE. BUT GOING

OUT ONTO THE BALCONY THAT LOOKED DOWN

OVER THE RIVER AND THE OLD PART OF THE CITY.

AND SIMPLY STANDING THERE SPEECHLESS.

NUDE. WATCHING THE SKY LIGHTEN.

SO THRILLED AND HAPPY. AS IF

WE’D BEEN PUT THERE

JUST AT THAT MOMENT.

WORK
FOR JOHN GARDNER D. SEPTEMBER 14 1982

LOVE OF WORK. THE BLOOD SINGING

IN THAT. THE FINE HIGH RISE

OF IT INTO THE WORK. A MAN SAYS

I’M WORKING. OR I WORKED TODAY.

OR I’M TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK.

HIM WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

AND BEING AWAKENED IN THE MORNING

BY HIS YOUNG WIFE HIS HEAD ON THE TYPEWRITER.

THE FULLNESS BEFORE WORK.

THE AMAZED UNDERSTANDING AFTER.

FASTENING HIS HELMET.

CLIMBING ONTO HIS MOTORCYCLE

AND THINKING ABOUT HOME.

AND WORK. YES WORK. THE GOING

TO WHAT LASTS.

IN THE YEAR 2020
WHICH OF US WILL BE LEFT THEN —

OLD DAZED UNCLEAR —

BUT WILLING TO TALK ABOUT OUR DEAD FRIENDS?

TALK AND TALK LIKE AN OLD FAUCET LEAKING.

SO THAT THE YOUNG ONES

RESPECTFUL TOUCHINGLY CURIOUS

WILL FIND THEMSELVES STIRRED

BY THE RECOLLECTIONS.

BY THE VERY MENTION OF THIS NAME

OR THAT NAME AND WHAT WE DID TOGETHER.

(AS WE WERE RESPECTFUL BUT CURIOUS

AND EXCITED TO HEAR SOMEONE TELL

ABOUT THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD AHEAD OF US.)

OF WHICH OF US WILL THEY SAY

TO THEIR FRIENDS

HE KNEW SO AND SO! HE WAS FRIENDS WITH_____

AND THEY SPENT TIME TOGETHER.

HE WAS AT THAT BIG PARTY.

EVERYONE WAS THERE. THEY CELEBRATED

AND DANCED UNTIL DAWN. THEY PUT THEIR ARMS

AROUND EACH OTHER AND DANCED

UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP.

NOW THEY’RE ALL GONE.

OF WHICH OF US WILL IT BE SAID —

HE KNEW THEM? SHOOK HANDS WITH THEM

AND EMBRACED THEM STAYED OVERNIGHT

IN THEIR WARM HOUSES. LOVED THEM!

FRIENDS I DO LOVE YOU IT’S TRUE.

AND I HOPE I’M LUCKY ENOUGH PRIVILEGED ENOUGH

TO LIVE ON AND BEAR WITNESS.

BELIEVE ME I’LL SAY ONLY THE MOST

GLORIOUS THINGS ABOUT YOU AND OUR TIME HERE!

FOR THE SURVIVOR THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING

TO LOOK FORWARD TO. GROWING OLD

LOSING EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY.

THE JUGGLER AT HEAVEN’S GATE
FOR MICHAEL CIMINO

BEHIND THE DIRTY TABLE WHERE KRISTOFFERSON IS HAVING

BREAKFAST THERE’S A WINDOW THAT LOOKS ONTO A NINETEENTH-CENTURY

STREET IN SWEETWATER WYOMING. A JUGGLER

IS AT WORK OUT THERE WEARING A TOP HAT AND A FROCK COAT

A LITTLE REED OF A FELLOW KEEPING THREE STICKS

IN THE AIR. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE.

THIS JUGGLER. THIS AMAZING ACT OF THE MIND AND HANDS.

A MAN WHO JUGGLES FOR A LIVING.

EVERYONE IN HIS TIME HAS KNOWN A STAR

OR A GUNFIGHTER. SOMEBODY ANYWAY WHO PUSHES SOMEBODY

AROUND. BUT A JUGGLER! BLUE SMOKE HANGS INSIDE

THIS AWFUL CAFÉ AND OVER THAT DIRTY TABLE WHERE TWO

GROWNUP MEN TALK ABOUT A WOMAN’S FUTURE. AND SOMETHING

SOMETHING ABOUT THE CATTLEMEN’S ASSOCIATION.

BUT THE EYE KEEPS GOING BACK TO THAT JUGGLER.

THAT TINY SPECTACLE. AT THIS MINUTE ELLA’S PLIGHT

OR THE FATE OF THE EMIGRANTS

IS NOT NEARLY SO IMPORTANT AS THIS JUGGLER’S EXPLOITS.

HOW’D HE GET INTO THE ACT ANYWAY? WHAT’S HIS STORY?

THAT’S THE STORY I WANT TO KNOW. ANYBODY

CAN WEAR A GUN AND SWAGGER AROUND. OR FALL IN LOVE

WITH SOMEBODY WHO LOVES SOMEBODY ELSE. BUT TO JUGGLE

FOR GOD’S SAKE! TO GIVE YOUR LIFE TO THAT.

TO GO WITH THAT. JUGGLING.

MY DAUGHTER AND APPLE PIE
SHE SERVES ME A PIECE OF IT A FEW MINUTES

OUT OF THE OVEN. A LITTLE STEAM RISES

FROM THE SLITS ON TOP. SUGAR AND SPICE —

CINNAMON—BURNED INTO THE CRUST.

BUT SHE’S WEARING THESE DARK GLASSES

IN THE KITCHEN AT TEN O’CLOCK

IN THE MORNING—EVERYTHING NICE —

AS SHE WATCHES ME BREAK OFF

A PIECE BRING IT TO MY MOUTH

AND BLOW ON IT. MY DAUGHTER’S KITCHEN

IN WINTER. I FORK THE PIE IN

AND TELL MYSELF TO STAY OUT OF IT.

SHE SAYS SHE LOVES HIM. NO WAY

COULD IT BE WORSE.

COMMERCE
A SWANK DINNER. FOOD TRULY WONDERFUL

AND PLENTY OF IT. IT WAS THE WAY I ALWAYS DREAMED

IT WOULD BE. AND IT JUST KEPT COMING

WHILE WE TALKED ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE.

EVEN WHEN WE WEREN’T TALKING ABOUT IT

IT WAS THERE—IN THE OYSTERS THE LAMB

THE SAUCES THE FINE WHITE LINEN THE CUTLERY

AND GOBLETS. IT SAID HERE IS YOUR LIFE ENJOY.

THIS IS THE POEM I WANTED TO LIVE TO WRITE! THEN

TO COME UPON THE SPIRIT IN A FLAMING DESSERT —

THE STREAKS OF FIRE SHOOTING UP ONLY TO DROP

BACK AS IF EXHAUSTED.

DRIVING HOME AFTERWARDS MY HEAD ASWIM

FROM OVEREATING. WHAT A SWINE! I DESERVE

EVERYTHING THAT FELLOW’S GOING TO SAY ABOUT ME.

FALLING ASLEEP IN MY PANTS ON TOP OF THE COVERS.

BUT NOT BEFORE THINKING ABOUT WOLVES

A SULTRY DAY IN THE WOODS.

MY LIFE STAKED DOWN IN THE CLEARING.

WHEN I TRY TO TURN MY HEAD TO REVEAL

THE FLESHY NECK I CAN’T MOVE.

I DON’T HAVE THE ENERGY. LET THEM GO

FOR THE BELLY THOSE BROTHER WOLVES

WITH THE BURNING EYES.

TO HAVE COME THIS FAR IN A SINGLE NIGHT!

BUT THEN I NEVER KNEW WHEN TO STOP.

THE FISHING POLE OF THE DROWNED MAN
I DIDN’T WANT TO USE IT AT FIRST.

THEN I THOUGHT NO IT WOULD

GIVE UP SECRETS AND BRING ME LUCK —

THAT’S WHAT I NEEDED THEN.

BESIDES HE’D LEFT IT BEHIND FOR ME

TO USE WHEN HE WENT SWIMMING THAT TIME.

SHORTLY AFTERWARDS I MET TWO WOMEN.

ONE OF THEM LOVED OPERA AND THE OTHER

WAS A DRUNK WHO’D DONE TIME

IN JAIL. I TOOK UP WITH ONE

AND BEGAN TO DRINK AND FIGHT A LOT.

THE WAY THIS WOMAN COULD SING AND CARRY ON!

WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM.

A WALK
I TOOK A WALK ON THE RAILROAD TRACK.

FOLLOWED THAT FOR A WHILE

AND GOT OFF AT THE COUNTRY GRAVEYARD

WHERE A MAN SLEEPS BETWEEN

TWO WIVES. EMILY VAN DER ZEE

LOVING WIFE AND MOTHER

IS AT JOHN VAN DER ZEE’S RIGHT.

MARY THE SECOND MRS VAN DER ZEE

ALSO A LOVING WIFE TO HIS LEFT.

FIRST EMILY WENT THEN MARY.

AFTER A FEW YEARS THE OLD FELLOW HIMSELF.

ELEVEN CHILDREN CAME FROM THESE UNIONS.

AND THEY TOO WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE DEAD NOW.

THIS IS A QUIET PLACE. AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY

TO BREAK MY WALK SIT AND PROVIDE AGAINST

MY OWN DEATH WHICH COMES ON.

BUT I DON’T UNDERSTAND AND I DON’T UNDERSTAND.

ALL I KNOW ABOUT THIS FINE SWEATY LIFE

MY OWN OR ANYONE ELSE’S

IS THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE I’LL RISE UP

AND LEAVE THIS ASTONISHING PLACE

THAT GIVES SHELTER TO DEAD PEOPLE. THIS GRAVEYARD.

AND GO. WALKING FIRST ON ONE RAIL

AND THEN THE OTHER.

MY DAD’S WALLET
LONG BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN DEATH

MY DAD SAID HE WANTED TO LIE CLOSE

TO HIS PARENTS. HE MISSED THEM SO

AFTER THEY WENT AWAY.

HE SAID THIS ENOUGH THAT MY MOTHER REMEMBERED

AND I REMEMBERED. BUT WHEN THE BREATH

LEFT HIS LUNGS AND ALL SIGNS OF LIFE

HAD FADED HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A TOWN

512 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE HE WANTED MOST TO BE.

MY DAD THOUGH. HE WAS RESTLESS

EVEN IN DEATH. EVEN IN DEATH

HE HAD THIS ONE LAST TRIP TO TAKE.

ALL HIS LIFE HE LIKED TO WANDER

AND NOW HE HAD ONE MORE PLACE TO GET TO.

THE UNDERTAKER SAID HE’D ARRANGE IT

NOT TO WORRY. SOME POOR LIGHT

FROM THE WINDOW FELL ON THE DUSTY FLOOR

WHERE WE WAITED THAT AFTERNOON

UNTIL THE MAN CAME OUT OF THE BACK ROOM

AND PEELED OFF HIS RUBBER GLOVES.

HE CARRIED THE SMELL OF FORMALDEHYDE WITH HIM.

HE WAS A BIG MAN THIS UNDERTAKER SAID.

THEN BEGAN TO TELL US WHY

HE LIKED LIVING IN THIS SMALL TOWN.

THIS MAN WHO’D JUST OPENED MY DAD’S VEINS.

HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST? I SAID.

HE TOOK OUT HIS PAD AND PEN AND BEGAN

TO WRITE. FIRST THE PREPARATION CHARGES.

THEN HE FIGURED THE TRANSPORTATION

OF THE REMAINS AT 22 CENTS A MILE.

BUT THIS WAS A ROUND-TRIP FOR THE UNDERTAKER

DON’T FORGET. PLUS SAY SIX MEALS

AND TWO NIGHTS IN A MOTEL. HE FIGURED

SOME MORE. ADD A SURCHARGE OF

$210 FOR HIS TIME AND TROUBLE

AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

HE THOUGHT WE MIGHT ARGUE.

THERE WAS A SPOT OF COLOR ON

EACH OF HIS CHEEKS AS HE LOOKED UP

FROM HIS FIGURES. THE SAME POOR LIGHT

FELL IN THE SAME POOR PLACE ON

THE DUSTY FLOOR. MY MOTHER NODDED

AS IF SHE UNDERSTOOD. BUT SHE

HADN’T UNDERSTOOD A WORD OF IT.

NONE OF IT HAD MADE ANY SENSE TO HER

BEGINNING WITH THE TIME SHE LEFT HOME

WITH MY DAD. SHE ONLY KNEW

THAT WHATEVER WAS HAPPENING

WAS GOING TO TAKE MONEY.

SHE REACHED INTO HER PURSE AND BROUGHT UP

MY DAD’S WALLET. THE THREE OF US

IN THAT LITTLE ROOM THAT AFTERNOON.

OUR BREATH COMING AND GOING.

WE STARED AT THE WALLET FOR A MINUTE.

NOBODY SAID ANYTHING.

ALL THE LIFE HAD GONE OUT OF THAT WALLET.

IT WAS OLD AND RENT AND SOILED.

BUT IT WAS MY DAD’S WALLET. AND SHE OPENED

IT AND LOOKED INSIDE. DREW OUT

A HANDFUL OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO

TOWARD THIS LAST MOST ASTOUNDING TRIP.

ASK HIM
RELUCTANTLY MY SON GOES WITH ME

THROUGH THE IRON GATES

OF THE CEMETERY IN MONTPARNASSE.

“WHAT A WAY TO SPEND A DAY IN PARIS!”

IS WHAT HE’D LIKE TO SAY. DID IN FACT SAY.

HE SPEAKS FRENCH. HAS STARTED A CONVERSATION

WITH A WHITE-HAIRED GUARD WHO OFFERS HIMSELF

AS OUR INFORMAL GUIDE. SO WE MOVE SLOWLY

THE THREE OF US ALONG ROW UPON ROW OF GRAVES.

EVERYONE IT SEEMS IS HERE.

IT’S QUIET AND HOT AND THE STREET SOUNDS

OF PARIS CAN’T REACH. THE GUARD WANTS TO STEER US

TO THE GRAVE OF THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE SUBMARINE

AND MAURICE CHEVALIER’S GRAVE. AND THE GRAVE

OF THE 28-YEAR-OLD SINGER NONNIE

COVERED WITH A MOUND OF RED ROSES.

I WANT TO SEE THE GRAVES OF THE WRITERS.

MY SON SIGHS. HE DOESN’T WANT TO SEE ANY OF IT.

HAS SEEN ENOUGH. HE’S PASSED BEYOND BOREDOM

INTO RESIGNATION. GUY DE MAUPASSANT; SARTRE; SAINTE-BEUVE;

GAUTIER; THE GONCOURTS; PAUL VERLAINE AND HIS OLD COMRADE

CHARLES BAUDELAIRE. WHERE WE LINGER.

NONE OF THESE NAMES OR GRAVES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

WITH THE UNTROUBLED LIVES OF MY SON AND THE GUARD.

WHO CAN THIS MORNING TALK AND JOKE TOGETHER

IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE UNDER A FINE SUN.

BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL NAMES CHISELED ON BAUDELAIRE’S STONE

AND I CAN’T UNDERSTAND WHY.

CHARLES BAUDELAIRE’S NAME IS BETWEEN THAT OF HIS MOTHER

WHO LOANED HIM MONEY AND WORRIED ALL HER LIFE

ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND HIS STEPFATHER A MARTINET

HE HATED AND WHO HATED HIM AND EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR.

“ASK YOUR FRIEND” I SAY. SO MY SON ASKS.

IT’S AS IF HE AND THE GUARD ARE OLD FRIENDS NOW

AND I’M THERE TO BE HUMORED.

THE GUARD SAYS SOMETHING AND THEN LAYS

ONE HAND OVER THE OTHER. LIKE THAT. DOES IT

AGAIN. ONE HAND OVER THE OTHER. GRINNING. SHRUGGING.

MY SON TRANSLATES. BUT I UNDERSTAND.

“LIKE A SANDWICH POP” MY SON SAYS. “A BAUDELAIRE SANDWICH.”

AT WHICH THE THREE OF US WALK ON.

THE GUARD WOULD AS SOON BE DOING THIS AS SOMETHING ELSE.

HE LIGHTS HIS PIPE. LOOKS AT HIS WATCH. IT’S ALMOST TIME

FOR HIS LUNCH AND A GLASS OF WINE.

“ASK HIM” I SAY “IF HE WANTS TO BE BURIED

IN THIS CEMETERY WHEN HE DIES.

ASK HIM WHERE HE WANTS TO BE BURIED.”

MY SON IS CAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING.

I RECOGNIZE THE WORDS TOMBEAU AND MORT

IN HIS MOUTH. THE GUARD STOPS.

IT’S CLEAR HIS THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN ELSEWHERE.

UNDERWATER WARFARE. THE MUSIC HALL THE CINEMA.

SOMETHING TO EAT AND THE GLASS OF WINE.

NOT CORRUPTION NO AND THE FALLING AWAY.

NOT ANNIHILATION. NOT HIS DEATH.

HE LOOKS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US.

WHO ARE WE KIDDING? ARE WE MAKING A BAD JOKE?

HE SALUTES AND WALKS AWAY.

HEADING FOR A TABLE AT AN OUTDOOR CAFÉ.

WHERE HE CAN TAKE OFF HIS CAP RUN HIS FINGERS

THROUGH HIS HAIR. HEAR LAUGHTER AND VOICES.

THE HEAVY CLINK OF SILVERWARE. THE RINGING

OF GLASSES. SUN ON THE WINDOWS.

SUN ON THE SIDEWALK AND IN THE LEAVES.

SUN FINDING ITS WAY ONTO HIS TABLE. HIS GLASS. HIS HANDS.

NEXT DOOR
THE WOMAN ASKED US IN FOR PIE. STARTED

TELLING ABOUT HER HUSBAND THE MAN WHO

USED TO LIVE THERE. HOW HE HAD TO BE CARTED

OFF TO THE NURSING HOME. HE WANTED

TO COVER THIS FINE OAK CEILING

WITH CHEAP INSULATION SHE SAID. THAT WAS THE FIRST

SIGN OF ANYTHING BEING WRONG. THEN HE HAD

A STROKE. A VEGETABLE NOW. ANYWAY

NEXT THE GAME WARDEN STUCK THE BARREL

OF HIS PISTOL INTO HER SON’S EAR.

AND COCKED THE HAMMER. BUT THE KID

WASN’T DOING THAT MUCH WRONG AND THE GAME

WARDEN IS THE KID’S UNCLE DON’T YOU SEE?

SO EVERYBODY’S ON THE OUTS. EVERYBODY’S

NUTS AND NOBODY’S SPEAKING TO ANYBODY

THESE DAYS. HERE’S A BIG BONE THE SON

FOUND AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER.

MAYBE IT’S A HUMAN BONE? AN ARM BONE

OR SOMETHING? SHE PUTS IT BACK ON THE WINDOW-

SILL NEXT TO A BOWL OF FLOWERS.

THE DAUGHTER STAYS IN HER ROOM ALL DAY

WRITING POEMS ABOUT HER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

THAT’S WHY WE DON’T SEE HER. NOBODY SEES

HER ANYMORE. SHE TEARS UP THE POEMS

AND WRITES THEM OVER AGAIN. BUT ONE OF THESE

DAYS SHE’LL GET IT RIGHT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT —

THE CAR THREW A ROD? THAT BLACK CAR

THAT STANDS LIKE A HEARSE

IN THE YARD NEXT DOOR. THE ENGINE WINCHED OUT

SWINGING FROM A TREE.

THE CAUCASUS: A ROMANCE
EACH EVENING AN EAGLE SOARS DOWN FROM THE SNOWY

CRAGS AND PASSES OVER CAMP. IT WANTS TO SEE

IF IT’S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY BACK IN RUSSIA: THE ONLY

CAREER OPEN TO YOUNG MEN THESE DAYS

IS THE MILITARY. YOUNG MEN OF GOOD FAMILY AND A FEW

OTHERS—OLDER SILENT MEN—MEN WHO’VE BLOTTED THEIR

COPYBOOKS AS THEY CALL IT OUT HERE. MEN LIKE

THE COLONEL WHO LOST HIS EAR IN A DUEL.

DENSE FORESTS OF PINE ALDER AND BIRCH. TORRENTS

THAT FALL FROM DIZZYING PRECIPICES. MIST. CLAMOROUS

RIVERS. MOUNTAINS COVERED WITH SNOW EVEN NOW EVEN

IN AUGUST. EVERYWHERE AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH

PROFUSION. A SEA OF POPPIES. WILD BUCKWHEAT THAT

SHIMMERS IN THE HEAT THAT WAVES AND ROLLS TO THE HORIZON.

PANTHERS. BEES AS BIG AS A BOY’S FIST. BEARS THAT WON’T

GET OUT OF A MAN’S WAY THAT WILL TEAR A BODY TO

PIECES AND THEN GO BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF ROOTING

AND CHUFFING LIKE HOGS IN THE RICH UNDERGROWTH. CLOUDS

OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES THAT RISE THEN SETTLE AND

RISE AGAIN ON SLOPES THICK WITH LILAC AND FERN.

NOW AND THEN A REAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ENEMY.

MUCH HOWLING FROM THEIR SIDE CRIES THE DRUM

OF HORSES’ HOOVES RATTLE OF MUSKET FIRE A CHECHEN’S BALL

SMASHING INTO A MAN’S BREAST A STAIN THAT BLOSSOMS

AND SPREADS THAT RIPPLES OVER THE WHITE UNIFORM LIKE CRIMSON

PETALS OPENING. THEN THE CHASE BEGINS: HEARTS RACING

MINDS EMPTYING OUT ENTIRELY AS THE EMPEROR’S YOUNG

MEN DANDIES ALL GALLOP OVER PLAINS LAUGHING

YELLING THEIR LUNGS OUT. OR ELSE THEY URGE

THEIR LATHERED HORSES ALONG FOREST TRAILS PISTOLS

READY. THEY BURN CHECHEN CROPS KILL CHECHEN STOCK

KNOCK DOWN THE PITIFUL VILLAGES. THEY’RE SOLDIERS

AFTER ALL AND THESE ARE NOT MANEUVERS. SHAMIL

THE BANDIT CHIEFTAIN HE’S THE ONE THEY WANT MOST.

AT NIGHT A MOON BROAD AND DEEP AS A SERVING DISH

SALLIES OUT FROM BEHIND THE PEAKS. BUT THIS

MOON IS ONLY FOR APPEARANCE’S SAKE. REALLY IT’S

ARMED TO THE TEETH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT HERE.

WHEN THE COLONEL SLEEPS HE DREAMS OF A DRAWING ROOM —

ONE DRAWING ROOM IN PARTICULAR—OH CLEAN AND ELEGANT

MOST COMFORTABLE DRAWING ROOM! WHERE FRIENDS LOUNGE

IN PLUSH CHAIRS OR ON DIVANS AND DRINK FROM

LITTLE GLASSES OF TEA. IN THE DREAM IT IS ALWAYS

THURSDAY 2—4. THERE IS A PIANO NEXT TO THE WINDOW

THAT LOOKS OUT ON NEVSKY PROSPECT. A YOUNG WOMAN

FINISHES PLAYING PAUSES AND TURNS TO THE POLITE

APPLAUSE. BUT IN THE DREAM IT IS THE CIRCASSIAN

WOMAN WITH A SABER CUT ACROSS HER FACE. HIS FRIENDS

DRAW BACK IN HORROR. THEY LOWER THEIR EYES BOW

AND BEGIN TAKING THEIR LEAVE. GOODBYE GOODBYE

THEY MUTTER. IN PETERSBURG THEY SAID THAT OUT HERE

IN THE CAUCASUS SUNSETS ARE EVERYTHING.

BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE; SUNSETS ARE NOT ENOUGH.

IN PETERSBURG THEY SAID THE CAUCASUS IS A COUNTRY THAT GIVES

RISE TO LEGEND WHERE HEROES ARE BORN EVERY DAY.

THEY SAID LONG AGO IN PETERSBURG THAT REPUTATIONS

WERE MADE AND LOST IN THE CAUCASUS. A GRAVELY

BEAUTIFUL PLACE AS ONE OF THE COLONEL’S MEN PUT IT.

THE OFFICERS SERVING UNDER HIM WILL RETURN

HOME SOON AND MORE YOUNG MEN WILL COME TO TAKE

THEIR PLACES. AFTER THE NEW ARRIVALS DISMOUNT

TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS THE COLONEL WILL KEEP THEM

WAITING A TIME. THEN FIX THEM WITH A STERN BUT

FATHERLY GAZE THESE SLIM YOUNG MEN WITH TINY

MUSTACHES AND BOISTEROUS HIGH SPIRITS WHO LOOK

AT HIM AND WONDER WHO ASK THEMSELVES WHAT IT IS

HE’S RUNNING FROM. BUT HE’S NOT RUNNING. HE LIKES IT

HERE IN THE CAUCASUS AFTER A FASHION. HE’S EVEN

GROWN USED TO IT—OR NEARLY. THERE’S PLENTY TO DO

GOD KNOWS. PLENTY OF GRIM WORK IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS

AHEAD. SHAMIL IS OUT THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS SOMEWHERE —

OR MAYBE HE’S ON THE STEPPES. THE SCENERY IS LOVELY

YOU CAN BE SURE AND THIS BUT A ROUGH RECORD

OF THE ACTUAL AND THE PASSING.

A FORGE AND A SCYTHE
ONE MINUTE I HAD THE WINDOWS OPEN

AND THE SUN WAS OUT. WARM BREEZES

BLEW THROUGH THE ROOM.

(I REMARKED ON THIS IN A LETTER.)

THEN WHILE I WATCHED IT GREW DARK.

THE WATER BEGAN WHITECAPPING.

ALL THE SPORT-FISHING BOATS TURNED

AND HEADED IN A LITTLE FLEET.

THOSE WIND-CHIMES ON THE PORCH

BLEW DOWN. THE TOPS OF OUR TREES SHOOK.

THE STOVE PIPE SQUEAKED AND RATTLED

AROUND IN ITS MOORINGS.

I SAID “A FORGE AND A SCYTHE.”

I TALK TO MYSELF LIKE THIS.

SAYING THE NAMES OF THINGS —

CAPSTAN HAWSER LOAM LEAF FURNACE.

YOUR FACE YOUR MOUTH YOUR SHOULDER

INCONCEIVABLE TO ME NOW!

WHERE DID THEY GO? IT’S LIKE

I DREAMED THEM. THE STONES WE BROUGHT

HOME FROM THE BEACH LIE FACE UP

ON THE WINDOWSILL COOLING.

COME HOME. DO YOU HEAR?

MY LUNGS ARE THICK WITH THE SMOKE

OF YOUR ABSENCE.

THE PIPE
THE NEXT POEM I WRITE WILL HAVE FIREWOOD

RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FIREWOOD SO THICK

WITH PITCH MY FRIEND WILL LEAVE BEHIND

HIS GLOVES AND TELL ME “WEAR THESE WHEN YOU

HANDLE THAT STUFF.” THE NEXT POEM

WILL HAVE NIGHT IN IT TOO AND ALL THE STARS

IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE; AND AN IMMENSE BODY

OF WATER SHINING FOR MILES UNDER A NEW MOON.

THE NEXT POEM WILL HAVE A BEDROOM

AND LIVING ROOM FOR ITSELF SKYLIGHTS

A SOFA A TABLE AND CHAIRS BY THE WINDOW

A VASE OF VIOLETS CUT JUST AN HOUR BEFORE LUNCH.

THERE’LL BE A LAMP BURNING IN THE NEXT POEM;

AND A FIREPLACE WHERE PITCH-SOAKED

BLOCKS OF FIR FLAME UP CONSUMING ONE ANOTHER.

OH THE NEXT POEM WILL THROW SPARKS!

BUT THERE WON’T BE ANY CIGARETTES IN THAT POEM.

I’LL TAKE UP SMOKING THE PIPE.

LISTENING
IT WAS A NIGHT LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. EMPTY

OF EVERYTHING SAVE MEMORY. HE THOUGHT

HE’D GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS.

BUT HE HADN’T. HE READ A LITTLE

AND LISTENED TO THE RADIO. LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW

FOR A WHILE. THEN WENT UPSTAIRS. IN BED

REALIZED HE’D LEFT THE RADIO ON.

BUT CLOSED HIS EYES ANYWAY. INSIDE THE DEEP NIGHT

AS THE HOUSE SAILED WEST HE WOKE UP

TO HEAR VOICES MURMURING. AND FROZE.

THEN UNDERSTOOD IT WAS ONLY THE RADIO.

HE GOT UP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS. HE HAD

TO PEE ANYWAY. A LITTLE RAIN

THAT HADN’T BEEN THERE BEFORE WAS

FALLING OUTSIDE. THE VOICES

ON THE RADIO FADED AND THEN CAME BACK

AS IF FROM A LONG WAY. IT WASN’T

THE SAME STATION ANY LONGER. A MAN’S VOICE

SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BORODIN

AND HIS OPERA PRINCE IGOR. THE WOMAN

HE SAID THIS TO AGREED AND LAUGHED.

BEGAN TO TELL A LITTLE OF THE STORY.

THE MAN’S HAND DREW BACK FROM THE SWITCH.

ONCE MORE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE

OF MYSTERY. RAIN. LAUGHTER. HISTORY.

ART. THE HEGEMONY OF DEATH.

HE STOOD THERE LISTENING.

IN SWITZERLAND
FIRST THING TO DO IN ZURICH

IS TAKE THE NO. 5 “ZOO” TROLLEY

TO THE END OF THE TRACK

AND GET OFF. BEEN WARNED ABOUT

THE LIONS. HOW THEIR ROARS

CARRY OVER FROM THE ZOO COMPOUND

TO THE FLUTERN CEMETERY.

WHERE I WALK ALONG

THE VERY BEAUTIFUL PATH

TO JAMES JOYCE’S GRAVE.

ALWAYS THE FAMILY MAN HE’S HERE

WITH HIS WIFE NORA OF COURSE.

AND HIS SON GIORGIO

WHO DIED A FEW YEARS AGO.

LUCIA HIS DAUGHTER HIS SORROW

STILL ALIVE STILL CONFINED

IN AN INSTITUTION FOR THE INSANE.

WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT THE NEWS

OF HER FATHER’S DEATH SHE SAID:

WHAT IS HE DOING UNDER THE GROUND THAT IDIOT?

WHEN WILL HE DECIDE TO COME OUT?

HE’S WATCHING US ALL THE TIME.

I LINGERED A WHILE. I THINK

I SAID SOMETHING ALOUD TO MR JOYCE.

I MUST HAVE. I KNOW I MUST HAVE.

BUT I DON’T RECALL WHAT

NOW AND I’LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

A WEEK LATER TO THE DAY WE DEPART

ZURICH BY TRAIN FOR LUCERNE.

BUT EARLY THAT MORNING I TAKE

THE NO. 5 TROLLEY ONCE MORE

TO THE END OF THE LINE.

THE ROAR OF THE LIONS FALLS OVER

THE CEMETERY AS BEFORE.

THE GRASS HAS BEEN CUT.

I SIT ON IT FOR A WHILE AND SMOKE.

JUST FEELS GOOD TO BE THERE

CLOSE TO THE GRAVE. I DIDN’T

HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING THIS TIME.

THAT NIGHT WE GAMBLED AT THE TABLES

AT THE GRAND HOTEL-CASINO

ON THE VERY SHORE OF LAKE LUCERNE.

TOOK IN A STRIP SHOW LATER.

BUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE MEMORY

OF THAT GRAVE THAT CAME TO ME

IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOW

UNDER THE MUTED PINK STAGE LIGHT?

NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT.

OR ABOUT THE DESIRE THAT CAME LATER

CROWDING EVERYTHING ELSE OUT

LIKE A WAVE.

STILL LATER WE SAT ON A BENCH

UNDER SOME LINDEN TREES UNDER STARS.

MADE LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

REACHING INTO EACH OTHER’S CLOTHES FOR IT.

THE LAKE A FEW STEPS AWAY.

AFTERWARDS DIPPED OUR HANDS

INTO THE COLD WATER.

THEN WALKED BACK TO OUR HOTEL

HAPPY AND TIRED READY TO SLEEP

FOR EIGHT HOURS.

ALL OF US ALL OF US ALL OF US

TRYING TO SAVE

OUR IMMORTAL SOULS SOME WAYS

SEEMINGLY MORE ROUND-

ABOUT AND MYSTERIOUS

THAN OTHERS. WE’RE HAVING

A GOOD TIME HERE. BUT HOPE

ALL WILL BE REVEALED SOON.

A SQUALL
SHORTLY AFTER THREE P.M. TODAY A SQUALL

HIT THE CALM WATERS OF THE STRAIT.

A BLACK CLOUD MOVING FAST

CARRYING RAIN DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS.

THE WATER ROSE UP AND TURNED WHITE.

THEN IN FIVE MINUTES WAS AS BEFORE —

BLUE AND MOST REMARKABLE WITH JUST

A LITTLE CHOP. IT OCCURS TO ME

IT WAS THIS KIND OF SQUALL

THAT CAME UPON SHELLEY AND HIS FRIEND

WILLIAMS IN THE GULF OF SPEZIA ON

AN OTHERWISE FINE DAY. THERE THEY WERE

RUNNING AHEAD OF A SMART BREEZE

WIND-JAMMING CRYING OUT TO EACH OTHER

I WANT TO THINK IN SHEER EXUBERANCE.

IN SHELLEY’S JACKET POCKETS KEATS’S POEMS

AND A VOLUME OF SOPHOCLES!

THEN SOMETHING LIKE SMOKE ON THE WATER.

A BLACK CLOUD MOVING FAST

CARRYING RAIN DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS.

BLACK CLOUD

HASTENING ALONG THE END

OF THE FIRST ROMANTIC PERIOD

IN ENGLISH POETRY.

MY CROW
A CROW FLEW INTO THE TREE OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

IT WAS NOT TED HUGHES’S CROW OR GALWAY’S CROW.

OR FROST’S PASTERNAK’S OR LORCA’S CROW.

OR ONE OF HOMER’S CROWS STUFFED WITH GORE

AFTER THE BATTLE. THIS WAS JUST A CROW.

THAT NEVER FIT IN ANYWHERE IN ITS LIFE

OR DID ANYTHING WORTH MENTIONING.

IT SAT THERE ON THE BRANCH FOR A FEW MINUTES.

THEN PICKED UP AND FLEW BEAUTIFULLY

OUT OF MY LIFE.

THE PARTY
LAST NIGHT ALONE 3000 MILES AWAY FROM THE ONE

I LOVE I TURNED THE RADIO ON TO SOME JAZZ

AND MADE A HUGE BOWL OF POPCORN

WITH LOTS OF SALT ON IT. POURED BUTTER OVER IT.

TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND SAT IN A CHAIR

IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW WITH THE POPCORN AND

A CAN OF COKE. FORGOT EVERYTHING IMPORTANT

IN THE WORLD WHILE I ATE POPCORN AND LOOKED OUT

AT A HEAVY SEA AND THE LIGHTS OF TOWN.

THE POPCORN RUNNY WITH BUTTER COVERED WITH

SALT. I ATE IT UP UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING

LEFT EXCEPT A FEW OLD MAIDS. THEN

WASHED MY HANDS. SMOKED A COUPLE MORE CIGARETTES

WHILE I LISTENED TO THE BEAT OF THE LITTLE

MUSIC THAT WAS LEFT. THINGS HAD QUIETED WAY DOWN

THOUGH THE SEA WAS STILL RUNNING. WIND GAVE

THE HOUSE A LAST SHAKE WHEN I ROSE

AND TOOK THREE STEPS TURNED TOOK THREE MORE STEPS TURNED.

THEN I WENT TO BED AND SLEPT WONDERFULLY

AS ALWAYS. MY GOD WHAT A LIFE!

BUT I THOUGHT I SHOULD EXPLAIN LEAVE A NOTE ANYHOW

ABOUT THIS MESS IN THE LIVING ROOM

AND WHAT WENT ON HERE LAST NIGHT. JUST IN CASE

MY LIGHTS WENT OUT AND I KEELED OVER.

YES THERE WAS A PARTY HERE LAST NIGHT.

AND THE RADIO’S STILL ON. OKAY.

BUT IF I DIE TODAY I DIE HAPPY—THINKING

OF MY SWEETHEART AND OF THAT LAST POPCORN.

AFTER RAINY DAYS
AFTER RAINY DAYS AND THE SAME SERIOUS DOUBTS —

STRANGE TO WALK PAST THE GOLF COURSE

SUN OVERHEAD MEN PUTTING OR TEEING WHATEVER

THEY DO ON THOSE GREEN LINKS. TO THE RIVER THAT FLOWS

PAST THE CLUBHOUSE. EXPENSIVE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE

OF THE RIVER A DOG BARKING AT THIS KID

WHO REVS HIS MOTORCYCLE. TO SEE A MAN FIGHTING

A LARGE SALMON IN THE WATER JUST BELOW

THE FOOTBRIDGE. WHERE A COUPLE OF JOGGERS HAVE STOPPED

TO WATCH. NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN ANYTHING

LIKE THIS! STAY WITH HIM I THINK BREAKING

INTO A RUN. FOR CHRIST’S SAKE MAN HOLD ON!

INTERVIEW
TALKING ABOUT MYSELF ALL DAY

BROUGHT BACK

SOMETHING I THOUGHT OVER AND

DONE WITH. WHAT I’D FELT

FOR MARYANN—ANNA SHE CALLS

HERSELF NOW—ALL THOSE YEARS.

I WENT TO DRAW A GLASS OF WATER.

STOOD AT THE WINDOW FOR A TIME.

WHEN I CAME BACK

WE PASSED EASILY TO THE NEXT THING.

WENT ON WITH MY LIFE. BUT

THAT MEMORY ENTERING LIKE A SPIKE.

BLOOD
WE WERE FIVE AT THE CRAPS TABLE

NOT COUNTING THE CROUPIER

AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE MAN

NEXT TO ME HAD THE DICE

CUPPED IN HIS HAND.

HE BLEW ON HIS FINGERS SAID

COME ON BABY! AND LEANED

OVER THE TABLE TO THROW.

AT THAT MOMENT BRIGHT BLOOD RUSHED

FROM HIS NOSE SPATTERING

THE GREEN FELT CLOTH. HE DROPPED

THE DICE. STEPPED BACK AMAZED.

AND THEN TERRIFIED AS BLOOD

RAN DOWN HIS SHIRT. GOD

WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME?

HE CRIED. TOOK HOLD OF MY ARM.

I HEARD DEATH’S ENGINES TURNING.

BUT I WAS YOUNG AT THE TIME

AND DRUNK AND WANTED TO PLAY.

I DIDN’T HAVE TO LISTEN.

SO I WALKED AWAY. DIDN’T TURN BACK EVER

OR FIND THIS IN MY HEAD UNTIL TODAY.

TOMORROW
CIGARETTE SMOKE HANGING ON

IN THE LIVING ROOM. THE SHIP’S LIGHTS

OUT ON THE WATER DIMMING. THE STARS

BURNING HOLES IN THE SKY. BECOMING ASH YES.

BUT IT’S ALL RIGHT THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

THOSE LIGHTS WE CALL STARS.

BURN FOR A TIME AND THEN DIE.

ME HELL-BENT. WISHING

IT WERE TOMORROW ALREADY.

I REMEMBER MY MOTHER GOD LOVE HER

SAYING DON’T WISH FOR TOMORROW.

YOU’RE WISHING YOUR LIFE AWAY.

NEVERTHELESS I WISH

FOR TOMORROW. IN ALL ITS FINERY.

I WANT SLEEP TO COME AND GO SMOOTHLY.

LIKE PASSING OUT OF THE DOOR OF ONE CAR

INTO ANOTHER. AND THEN TO WAKE UP!

FIND TOMORROW IN MY BEDROOM.

I’M MORE TIRED NOW THAN I CAN SAY.

MY BOWL IS EMPTY. BUT IT’S MY BOWL YOU SEE

AND I LOVE IT.

GRIEF
WOKE UP EARLY THIS MORNING AND FROM MY BED

LOOKED FAR ACROSS THE STRAIT TO SEE

A SMALL BOAT MOVING THROUGH THE CHOPPY WATER

A SINGLE RUNNING LIGHT ON. REMEMBERED

MY FRIEND WHO USED TO SHOUT

HIS DEAD WIFE’S NAME FROM HILLTOPS

AROUND PERUGIA. WHO SET A PLATE

FOR HER AT HIS SIMPLE TABLE LONG AFTER

SHE WAS GONE. AND OPENED THE WINDOWS

SO SHE COULD HAVE FRESH AIR. SUCH DISPLAY

I FOUND EMBARRASSING. SO DID HIS OTHER

FRIENDS. I COULDN’T SEE IT.

NOT UNTIL THIS MORNING.

HARLEY’S SWANS
I’M TRYING AGAIN. A MAN HAS TO BEGIN

OVER AND OVER—TO TRY TO THINK AND FEEL

ONLY IN A VERY LIMITED FIELD THE HOUSE

ON THE STREET THE MAN AT THE CORNER DRUG STORE.

— SHERWOOD ANDERSON FROM A LETTER

ANDERSON I THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN I LOITERED

IN FRONT OF THE DRUG STORE THIS AFTERNOON.

HELD ONTO MY HAT IN THE WIND AND LOOKED DOWN

THE STREET FOR MY BOYHOOD. REMEMBERED MY DAD

TAKING ME TO GET HAIRCUTS —

THAT RACK OF ANTLERS MOUNTED ON A WALL

NEXT TO THE CALENDAR PICTURE OF A RAINBOW

TROUT LEAPING CLEAR OF THE WATER

WITH A HOOK IN ITS JAW. MY MOTHER.

HOW SHE WENT WITH ME TO PICK OUT

SCHOOL CLOTHES. THAT PART EMBARRASSING

BECAUSE I NEEDED TO SHOP IN MEN’S WEAR

FOR MAN-SIZED PANTS AND SHIRTS.

NOBODY THEN WHO COULD LOVE ME

THE FATTEST KID ON THE BLOCK EXCEPT MY PARENTS.

SO I QUIT LOOKING AND WENT INSIDE.

HAD A COKE AT THE SODA FOUNTAIN

WHERE I GAVE SOME THOUGHT TO BETRAYAL.

HOW THAT PART ALWAYS CAME EASY.

IT WAS WHAT CAME AFTER THAT WAS HARD.

I DIDN’T THINK ABOUT YOU ANYMORE ANDERSON.

YOU’D COME AND GONE IN AN INSTANT.

BUT I REMEMBERED THERE AT THE FOUNTAIN

HARLEY’S SWANS. HOW THEY GOT THERE

I DON’T KNOW. BUT ONE MORNING HE WAS TAKING

HIS SCHOOL BUS ALONG A COUNTRY ROAD

WHEN HE CAME ACROSS 21 OF THEM JUST DOWN

FROM CANADA. OUT ON THIS POND

IN A FARMER’S FIELD. HE BROUGHT HIS SCHOOL BUS

TO A STOP AND THEN HE AND HIS GRADE-SCHOOLERS

JUST LOOKED AT THEM FOR A WHILE AND FELT GOOD.

I FINISHED THE COKE AND DROVE HOME.

IT WAS ALMOST DARK NOW. THE HOUSE

QUIET AND EMPTY. THE WAY

I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WANTED IT TO BE.

THE WIND BLEW HARD ALL DAY.

BLEW EVERYTHING AWAY OR NEARLY.

BUT STILL THIS FEELING OF SHAME AND LOSS.

EVEN THOUGH THE WIND OUGHT TO LAY NOW

AND THE MOON COME OUT SOON IF THIS IS

ANYTHING LIKE THE OTHER NIGHTS.

I’M HERE IN THE HOUSE. AND I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

YOU OF ALL PEOPLE ANDERSON CAN UNDERSTAND.

ELK CAMP
EVERYONE ELSE SLEEPING WHEN I STEP

TO THE DOOR OF OUR TENT. OVERHEAD

STARS BRIGHTER THAN STARS EVER WERE

IN MY LIFE. AND FARTHER AWAY.

THE NOVEMBER MOON DRIVING

A FEW DARK CLOUDS OVER THE VALLEY.

THE OLYMPIC RANGE BEYOND.

I BELIEVED I COULD SMELL THE SNOW THAT WAS COMING.

OUR HORSES FEEDING INSIDE

THE LITTLE ROPE CORRAL WE’D THROWN UP.

FROM THE SIDE OF THE HILL THE SOUND

OF SPRING WATER. OUR SPRING WATER.

WIND PASSING IN THE TOPS OF THE FIR TREES.

I’D NEVER SMELLED A FOREST BEFORE THAT

NIGHT EITHER. REMEMBERED READING HOW

HENRY HUDSON AND HIS SAILORS SMELLED

THE FORESTS OF THE NEW WORLD

FROM MILES OUT AT SEA. AND THEN THE NEXT THOUGHT —

I COULD GLADLY LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE

AND NEVER PICK UP ANOTHER BOOK.

I LOOKED AT MY HANDS IN THE MOONLIGHT

AND UNDERSTOOD THERE WASN’T A MAN

WOMAN OR CHILD I COULD LIFT A FINGER

FOR THAT NIGHT. I TURNED BACK AND LAY

DOWN THEN IN MY SLEEPING BAG.

BUT MY EYES WOULDN’T CLOSE.

THE NEXT DAY I FOUND COUGAR SCAT

AND ELK DROPPINGS. BUT THOUGH I RODE

A HORSE ALL OVER THAT COUNTRY

UP AND DOWN HILLS THROUGH CLOUDS

AND ALONG OLD LOGGING ROADS

I NEVER SAW AN ELK. WHICH WAS

FINE BY ME. STILL I WAS READY.

LOST TO EVERYONE A RIFLE STRAPPED

TO MY SHOULDER. I THINK MAYBE

I COULD HAVE KILLED ONE.

WOULD HAVE SHOT AT ONE ANYWAY.

AIMED JUST WHERE I’D BEEN TOLD —

BEHIND THE SHOULDER AT THE HEART

AND LUNGS. “THEY MIGHT RUN

BUT THEY WON’T RUN FAR.

LOOK AT IT THIS WAY” MY FRIEND SAID.

“HOW FAR WOULD YOU RUN WITH A PIECE

OF LEAD IN YOUR HEART?” THAT DEPENDS

MY FRIEND. THAT DEPENDS. BUT THAT DAY

I COULD HAVE PULLED THE TRIGGER

ON ANYTHING. OR NOT.

NOTHING MATTERED ANYMORE

EXCEPT GETTING BACK TO CAMP

BEFORE DARK. WONDERFUL

TO LIVE THIS WAY! WHERE NOTHING

MATTERED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

I SAW MYSELF THROUGH AND THROUGH.

AND I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING TOO

AS MY LIFE FLEW BACK TO ME THERE IN THE WOODS.

AND THEN WE PACKED OUT. WHERE THE FIRST

THING I DID WAS TAKE A HOT BATH.

AND THEN REACH FOR THIS BOOK.

GROW COLD AND UNRELENTING ONCE MORE.

HEARTLESS. EVERY NERVE ALERT.

READY TO KILL OR NOT.

THE WINDOWS OF THE
SUMMER VACATION HOUSES
THEY WITHHELD JUDGMENT LOOKING DOWN AT US

SILENTLY IN THE RAIN IN OUR LITTLE BOAT —

AS THREE LINES WENT INTO THE DARK WATER

FOR SALMON. I’M TALKING OF THE HOOD CANAL

IN MARCH WHEN THE RAIN WON’T LET UP.

WHICH WAS FINE BY ME. I WAS HAPPY

TO BE ON THE WATER TRYING OUT

NEW GEAR. I HEARD OF THE DEATH

BY DROWNING OF A MAN I DIDN’T KNOW.

AND THE DEATH IN THE WOODS OF ANOTHER

HIT BY A SNAG. THEY DON’T CALL THEM

WIDOW-MAKERS FOR NOTHING.

HUNTING STORIES OF BEAR

ELK DEER COUGAR—TAKEN IN AND OUT

OF SEASON. MORE HUNTING STORIES.

WOMEN THIS TIME. AND THIS TIME

I COULD JOIN IN. IT USED TO BE GIRLS.

GIRLS OF 15 16 17 18—AND WE

THE SAME AGE. NOW IT WAS WOMEN. AND MARRIED

WOMEN AT THAT. NO LONGER GIRLS. WOMEN.

SOMEBODY OR OTHER’S WIFE. THE MAYOR

OF THIS TOWN FOR INSTANCE. HIS WIFE.

TAKEN. THE DEPUTY SHERIFF’S WIFE THE SAME.

BUT HE’S AN ASSHOLE ANYWAY.

EVEN A BROTHER’S WIFE. IT’S NOT ANYTHING

TO BE PROUD OF BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GO

AND DO HIS HOMEWORK FOR HIM. WE CAUGHT

TWO SMALL ONES AND TALKED A LOT AND LAUGHED.

BUT AS WE TURNED IN TO THE LANDING

A LIGHT WENT ON IN ONE OF THOSE HOUSES

WHERE NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

SMOKE DRIFTED UP FROM THE CHIMNEY

OF THIS PLACE WE’D LOOKED AT AS EMPTY.

AND SUDDENLY LIKE THAT—I REMEMBERED MARYANN.

WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNG.

THE RARE COIN OF THOSE MINT DAYS!

IT WAS THERE AND GONE

BY THE TIME WE HOOKED THE BOAT TO THE TRAILER.

BUT IT WAS SOMETHING TO RECALL.

IT TURNED DARK AS I WATCHED THE FIGURE

MOVE TO STAND AT THE WINDOW AND LOOK

DOWN. AND I KNEW THEN THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED

SO LONG AGO MUST HAVE HAPPENED BUT NOT

TO US. NO I DON’T THINK PEOPLE COULD GO ON LIVING

IF THEY HAD LIVED THOSE THINGS. IT COULDN’T

HAVE BEEN US.

THE PEOPLE I’M TALKING ABOUT—I’M SURE

I MUST HAVE READ ABOUT SOMEWHERE.

THEY WERE NOT THE MAIN CHARACTERS NO

AS I’D THOUGHT AT FIRST AND FOR A LONG

WHILE AFTER. BUT SOME OTHERS YOU

SYMPATHIZED WITH EVEN LOVED AND CRIED FOR —

JUST BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY

TO BE HANGED OR PUT SOMEWHERE.

WE DROVE OFF WITHOUT LOOKING BACK

AT THE HOUSES. LAST NIGHT

I CLEANED FISH IN THE KITCHEN.

THIS MORNING IT WAS STILL DARK

WHEN I MADE COFFEE. AND FOUND BLOOD

ON THE PORCELAIN SIDES OF THE SINK.

MORE BLOOD ON THE COUNTER. A TRAIL

OF IT. DROPS OF BLOOD ON THE BOTTOM

OF THE REFRIGERATOR WHERE THE FISH

LAY WRAPPED AND GUTTED.

EVERYWHERE THIS BLOOD. MINGLING WITH THOUGHTS

IN MY MIND OF THE TIME WE’D HAD —

THAT DEAR YOUNG WIFE AND I.

MEMORY [I]
CUTTING THE STEMS FROM A QUART

BASKET OF STRAWBERRIES—THE FIRST

THIS SPRING—LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW

I WOULD EAT THEM TONIGHT WHEN I WAS

ALONE FOR A TREAT (TESS BEING AWAY)

I REMEMBERED I FORGOT TO PASS ALONG

A MESSAGE TO HER WHEN WE TALKED:

SOMEBODY WHOSE NAME I FORGET

CALLED TO SAY SUSAN POWELL’S

GRANDMOTHER HAD DIED SUDDENLY.

WENT ON WORKING WITH THE STRAWBERRIES.

BUT REMEMBERED TOO DRIVING BACK

FROM THE STORE. A LITTLE GIRL

ON ROLLER SKATES BEING PULLED ALONG

THE ROAD BY THIS BIG FRIENDLY-

LOOKING DOG. I WAVED TO HER.

SHE WAVED BACK. AND CALLED OUT

SHARPLY TO HER DOG WHO KEPT

TRYING TO NOSE AROUND

IN THE SWEET DITCH GRASS.

    IT’S NEARLY DARK OUTSIDE NOW.

STRAWBERRIES ARE CHILLING.

A LITTLE LATER ON WHEN I EAT THEM

I’LL BE REMINDED AGAIN—IN NO PARTICULAR

ORDER—OF TESS THE LITTLE GIRL A DOG

ROLLER SKATES MEMORY DEATH ETC.

AWAY
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE QUAIL THAT LIVE

ON THE HILLSIDE OVER BEHIND ART AND MARILYN’S

PLACE. I OPENED UP THE HOUSE MADE A FIRE

AND AFTERWARDS SLEPT LIKE A DEAD MAN.

THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE QUAIL IN THE DRIVE

AND IN THE BUSHES OUTSIDE THE FRONT WINDOW.

I TALKED TO YOU ON THE PHONE.

TRIED TO JOKE. DON’T WORRY

ABOUT ME I SAID I HAVE THE QUAIL

FOR COMPANY. WELL THEY TOOK FLIGHT

WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR. A WEEK LATER

AND THEY STILL HAVEN’T COME BACK. WHEN I LOOK

AT THE SILENT TELEPHONE I THINK OF QUAIL.

WHEN I THINK OF THE QUAIL AND HOW THEY

WENT AWAY I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU THAT MORNING

AND HOW THE RECEIVER LAY IN MY HAND. MY HEART —

THE BLURRED THINGS IT WAS DOING AT THE TIME.

MUSIC
FRANZ LISZT ELOPED WITH COUNTESS MARIE D’AGOULT

WHO WROTE NOVELS. POLITE SOCIETY WASHED ITS HANDS

OF HIM AND HIS NOVELIST-COUNTESS-WHORE.

LISZT GAVE HER THREE CHILDREN AND MUSIC.

THEN WENT OFF WITH PRINCESS WITTGENSTEIN.

COSIMA LISZT’S DAUGHTER MARRIED

THE CONDUCTOR HANS VON BÜLOW.

BUT RICHARD WAGNER STOLE HER. TOOK HER AWAY

TO BAYREUTH. WHERE LISZT SHOWED UP ONE MORNING.

LONG WHITE HAIR FLOUNCING.

SHAKING HIS FIST. MUSIC. MUSIC!

EVERYBODY GREW MORE FAMOUS.

PLUS
“LATELY I’VE BEEN EATING A LOT OF PORK.

PLUS I EAT TOO MANY EGGS AND THINGS”

THIS GUY SAID TO ME IN THE DOC’S OFFICE.

“I POUR ON THE SALT. I DRINK TWENTY CUPS

OF COFFEE EVERY DAY. I SMOKE.

I’M HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY BREATHING.”

THEN LOWERED HIS EYES.

“PLUS I DON’T ALWAYS CLEAR OFF THE TABLE

WHEN I’M THROUGH EATING. I FORGET.

I JUST GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

GOODBYE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME BROTHER.

MISTER WHAT DO YOU THINK’S HAPPENING TO ME?”

HE WAS DESCRIBING MY OWN SYMPTOMS TO A T.

I SAID “WHAT DO YOU THINK’S HAPPENING?

YOU’RE LOSING YOUR MARBLES. AND THEN

YOU’RE GOING TO DIE. OR VICE VERSA.

WHAT ABOUT SWEETS? ARE YOU PARTIAL

TO CINNAMON ROLLS AND ICE CREAM?”

“PLUS I CRAVE ALL THAT” HE SAID.

BY THIS TIME WE WERE AT A PLACE CALLED FRIENDLY’S.

WE LOOKED AT MENUS AND WENT ON TALKING.

DINNER MUSIC PLAYED FROM A RADIO

IN THE KITCHEN. IT WAS OUR SONG SEE.

IT WAS OUR TABLE.

ALL HER LIFE
I LAY DOWN FOR A NAP. BUT EVERY TIME I CLOSED MY EYES

MARES’ TAILS PASSED SLOWLY OVER THE STRAIT

TOWARD CANADA. AND THE WAVES. THEY ROLLED UP ON THE BEACH

AND THEN BACK AGAIN. YOU KNOW I DON’T DREAM.

BUT LAST NIGHT I DREAMT WE WERE WATCHING

A BURIAL AT SEA. AT FIRST I WAS ASTONISHED.

AND THEN FILLED WITH REGRET. BUT YOU

TOUCHED MY ARM AND SAID “NO IT’S ALL RIGHT.

SHE WAS VERY OLD AND HE’D LOVED HER ALL HER LIFE.”

THE HAT
WALKING AROUND ON OUR FIRST DAY

IN MEXICO CITY WE COME TO A SIDEWALK CAFÉ

ON REFORMA AVENUE WHERE A MAN IN A HAT

SITS DRINKING A BEER.

AT FIRST THE MAN SEEMS JUST LIKE ANY

OTHER MAN WEARING A HAT DRINKING A BEER

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. BUT NEXT TO THIS MAN

ASLEEP ON THE BROAD SIDEWALK IS A BEAR

WITH ITS HEAD ON ITS PAWS. THE BEAR’S

EYES ARE CLOSED BUT NOT ALL THE WAY. AS IF

IT WERE THERE AND NOT THERE. EVERYONE

IS GIVING THE BEAR A WIDE BERTH.

BUT A CROWD IS GATHERING TOO BULGING

OUT ONTO THE AVENUE. THE MAN HAS

A CHAIN AROUND HIS WAIST. THE CHAIN

GOES FROM HIS LAP TO THE BEAR’S COLLAR

A BAND OF STEEL. ON THE TABLE

IN FRONT OF THE MAN RESTS AN IRON BAR

WITH A LEATHER HANDLE. AND AS IF THIS

WERE NOT ENOUGH THE MAN DRAINS THE LAST

OF HIS BEER AND PICKS UP HIS BAR.

GETS UP FROM THE TABLE AND HAULS

ON THE CHAIN. THE BEAR STIRS OPENS ITS

MOUTH—OLD BROWN AND YELLOW FANGS.

BUT FANGS. THE MAN JERKS ON THE CHAIN

HARD. THE BEAR RISES TO ALL FOURS NOW

AND GROWLS. THE MAN SLAPS THE BEAR ON

ITS SHOULDER WITH THE BAR BRINGING

A TINY CLOUD OF DUST. GROWLS SOMETHING

HIMSELF. THE BEAR WAITS WHILE THE MAN TAKES

ANOTHER SWING. SLOWLY THE BEAR RISES

ONTO ITS HIND LEGS SWINGS AT AIR AND AT

THAT GODDAMNED BAR. BEGINS TO SHUFFLE

THEN BEGINS TO SNAP ITS JAWS AS THE MAN

SLUGS IT AGAIN AND YES AGAIN

WITH THAT BAR. THERE’S A TAMBORINE.

I NEARLY FORGOT THAT. THE MAN SHAKES

IT AS HE CHANTS AS HE STRIKES THE BEAR

WHO WEAVES ON ITS HIND LEGS. GROWLS

AND SNAPS AND WEAVES IN A POOR DANCE.

THIS SCENE LASTS FOREVER. WHOLE SEASONS

COME AND GO BEFORE IT’S OVER AND THE BEAR

DROPS TO ALL FOURS. SITS DOWN ON ITS

HAUNCHES GIVES A LOW SAD GROWL.

THE MAN PUTS THE TAMBORINE ON THE TABLE.

PUTS THE IRON BAR ON THE TABLE TOO.

THEN HE TAKES OFF HIS HAT. NO ONE

APPLAUDS. A FEW PEOPLE SEE

WHAT’S COMING AND WALK AWAY. BUT NOT

BEFORE THE HAT APPEARS AT THE EDGE

OF THE CROWD AND BEGINS TO MAKE ITS

WAY FROM HAND TO HAND

THROUGH THE THRONG. THE HAT

COMES TO ME AND STOPS. I’M HOLDING

THE HAT AND I CAN’T BELIEVE IT.

EVERYBODY STARING AT IT.

I STARE RIGHT ALONG WITH THEM.

YOU SAY MY NAME AND IN THE SAME BREATH

HISS “FOR GOD’S SAKE PASS IT ALONG.”

I TOSS IN THE MONEY I HAVE. THEN

WE LEAVE AND GO ON TO THE NEXT THING.

HOURS LATER IN BED I TOUCH YOU

AND WAIT AND THEN TOUCH YOU AGAIN.

WHEREUPON YOU UNCURL YOUR FINGERS.

I PUT MY HANDS ALL OVER YOU THEN —

YOUR LIMBS YOUR LONG HAIR EVEN HAIR

THAT I TOUCH AND COVER MY FACE WITH

AND DRAW SALT FROM. BUT LATER

WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES THE HAT

APPEARS. THEN THE TAMBORINE. THE CHAIN.

LATE NIGHT WITH FOG AND HORSES
THEY WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM. SAYING THEIR

GOODBYES. LOSS RINGING IN THEIR EARS.

THEY’D BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER BUT NOW

THEY COULDN’T GO ANOTHER STEP. BESIDES FOR HIM

THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE. TEARS WERE FALLING

WHEN A HORSE STEPPED OUT OF THE FOG

INTO THE FRONT YARD. THEN ANOTHER AND

ANOTHER. SHE WENT OUTSIDE AND SAID

“WHERE DID YOU COME FROM YOU SWEET HORSES?”

AND MOVED IN AMONGST THEM WEEPING

TOUCHING THEIR FLANKS. THE HORSES BEGAN

TO GRAZE IN THE FRONT YARD.

HE MADE TWO CALLS: ONE CALL WENT STRAIGHT

TO THE SHERIFF— “SOMEONE’S HORSES ARE OUT.”

BUT THERE WAS THAT OTHER CALL TOO.

THEN HE JOINED HIS WIFE IN THE FRONT

YARD WHERE THEY TALKED AND MURMURED

TO THE HORSES TOGETHER. (WHATEVER WAS

HAPPENING NOW WAS HAPPENING IN ANOTHER TIME.)

HORSES CROPPED THE GRASS IN THE YARD

THAT NIGHT. A RED EMERGENCY LIGHT

FLASHED AS A SEDAN CREPT IN OUT OF FOG.

VOICES CARRIED OUT OF THE FOG.

AT THE END OF THAT LONG NIGHT

WHEN THEY FINALLY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND

EACH OTHER THEIR EMBRACE WAS FULL OF

PASSION AND MEMORY. EACH RECALLED

THE OTHER’S YOUTH. NOW SOMETHING HAD ENDED

SOMETHING ELSE RUSHING IN TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

CAME THE MOMENT OF LEAVE-TAKING ITSELF.

“GOODBYE GO ON” SHE SAID.

AND THE PULLING AWAY.

MUCH LATER

HE REMEMBERED MAKING A DISASTROUS PHONE CALL.

ONE THAT HAD HUNG ON AND HUNG ON

A MALEDICTION. IT’S BOILED DOWN

TO THAT. THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

MALEDICTION.

VENICE
THE GONDOLIER HANDED YOU A ROSE.

TOOK US UP ONE CANAL

AND THEN ANOTHER. WE GLIDED

PAST CASANOVA’S PALACE THE PALACE OF

THE ROSSI FAMILY PALACES BELONGING

TO THE BAGLIONI THE PISANI AND SANGALLO.

FLOODED. STINKING. WHAT’S LEFT

LEFT TO RATS. BLACKNESS.

THE SILENCE TOTAL OR NEARLY.

THE MAN’S BREATH COMING AND GOING

BEHIND MY EAR. THE DRIP OF THE OAR.

WE GLIDING SILENTLY ON AND ON.

WHO WOULD BLAME ME IF I FALL

TO THINKING ABOUT DEATH?

A SHUTTER OPENED ABOVE OUR HEADS.

A LITTLE LIGHT SHOWED THROUGH

BEFORE THE SHUTTER WAS CLOSED ONCE

MORE. THERE IS THAT AND THE ROSE

IN YOUR HAND. AND HISTORY.

THE EVE OF BATTLE
THERE ARE FIVE OF US IN THE TENT NOT COUNTING

THE BATMAN CLEANING MY RIFLE. THERE’S

A LIVELY ARGUMENT GOING ON AMONGST MY BROTHER

OFFICERS. IN THE COOKPOT SALT PORK TURNS

ALONGSIDE SOME MACARONI. BUT THESE FINE FELLOWS

AREN’T HUNGRY—AND IT’S A GOOD THING!

ALL THEY WANT IS TO HARRUMPH ABOUT THE LIKES

OF HUSS AND HEGEL ANYTHING TO PASS THE TIME.

WHO CARES? TOMORROW WE FIGHT. TONIGHT THEY WANT

TO SIT AROUND AND CHATTER ABOUT NOTHING ABOUT

PHILOSOPHY. MAYBE THE COOKPOT ISN’T THERE

FOR THEM? NOR THE STOVE OR THOSE FOLDING

STOOLS THEY’RE SITTING ON. MAYBE THERE ISN’T

A BATTLE WAITING FOR THEM TOMORROW MORNING?

WE’D ALL LIKE THAT BEST. MAYBE

I’M NOT THERE FOR THEM EITHER. READY

TO DISH UP SOMETHING TO EAT. UN EST AUTRE

AS SOMEONE SAID. I OR ANOTHER MAY AS WELL BE

IN CHINA. TIME TO EAT BROTHERS

I SAY HANDING ROUND THE PLATES. BUT SOMEONE

HAS JUST RIDDEN UP AND DISMOUNTED. MY BATMAN

MOVES TO THE DOOR OF THE TENT THEN DROPS HIS PLATE

AND STEPS BACK. DEATH WALKS IN WITHOUT SAYING

ANYTHING DRESSED IN COAT-AND-TAILS.

AT FIRST I THINK HE MUST BE LOOKING FOR THE EMPEROR

WHO’S OLD AND AILING ANYWAY. THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

IT. DEATH’S LOST HIS WAY. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

HE HAS A SLIP OF PAPER IN HIS HAND LOOKS US OVER

QUICKLY CONSULTS SOME NAMES.

HE RAISES HIS EYES. I TURN TO THE STOVE.

WHEN I TURN BACK EVERYONE HAS GONE. EVERYONE

EXCEPT DEATH. HE’S STILL THERE UNMOVING.

I GIVE HIM HIS PLATE. HE’S COME A LONG

WAY. HE IS HUNGRY I THINK AND WILL EAT ANYTHING.

EXTIRPATION
A LITTLE QUIETLY OUTSTANDING UPTOWN

PIANO MUSIC PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND

AS WE SAT AT THE BAR IN THE LOUNGE.

DISCUSSING THE FATE OF THE LAST CARIBOU HERD IN THE US.

THIRTY ANIMALS WHO ROAM A SMALL CORNER

OF THE IDAHO PANHANDLE. THIRTY ANIMALS

JUST NORTH OF BONNER’S FERRY

THIS GUY SAID. THEN CALLED FOR ANOTHER ROUND.

BUT I HAD TO GO. WE NEVER SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN.

NEVER SPOKE ANOTHER WORD TO EACH OTHER

OR DID ANYTHING WORTH GETTING EXCITED ABOUT

THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

THE CATCH
HAPPY TO HAVE THESE FISH!

IN SPITE OF THE RAIN THEY CAME

TO THE SURFACE AND TOOK

THE NO. 14 BLACK MOSQUITO.

HE HAD TO CONCENTRATE

CLOSE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT

FOR A CHANGE. HIS OLD LIFE

WHICH HE CARRIED AROUND

LIKE A PACK. AND THE NEW ONE

THAT ONE TOO. TIME AND AGAIN

HE MADE WHAT HE FELT WERE THE MOST

INTIMATE OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS.

STRAINED HIS HEART TO SEE

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RAINDROP

AND A BROOK TROUT. LATER

WALKING ACROSS THE WET FIELD

TO THE CAR. WATCHING

THE WIND CHANGE THE ASPEN TREES.

HE ABANDONED EVERYONE

HE ONCE LOVED.

MY DEATH
IF I’M LUCKY I’LL BE WIRED EVERY WHICHWAY

IN A HOSPITAL BED. TUBES RUNNING INTO

MY NOSE. BUT TRY NOT TO BE SCARED OF ME FRIENDS!

I’M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THAT THIS IS OKAY.

IT’S LITTLE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR AT THE END.

SOMEONE I HOPE WILL HAVE PHONED EVERYONE

TO SAY “COME QUICK HE’S FAILING!”

AND THEY WILL COME. AND THERE WILL BE TIME FOR ME

TO BID GOODBYE TO EACH OF MY LOVED ONES.

IF I’M LUCKY THEY’LL STEP FORWARD

AND I’LL BE ABLE TO SEE THEM ONE LAST TIME

AND TAKE THAT MEMORY WITH ME.

SURE THEY MIGHT LAY EYES ON ME AND WANT TO RUN AWAY

AND HOWL. BUT INSTEAD SINCE THEY LOVE ME

THEY’LL LIFT MY HAND AND SAY “COURAGE”

OR “IT’S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.”

AND THEY’RE RIGHT. IT IS ALL RIGHT.

IT’S JUST FINE. IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW HAPPY YOU’VE MADE ME!

I JUST HOPE MY LUCK HOLDS AND I CAN MAKE

SOME SIGN OF RECOGNITION.

OPEN AND CLOSE MY EYES AS IF TO SAY

“YES I HEAR YOU. I UNDERSTAND YOU.”

I MAY EVEN MANAGE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

“I LOVE YOU TOO. BE HAPPY.”

I HOPE SO! BUT I DON’T WANT TO ASK FOR TOO MUCH.

IF I’M UNLUCKY AS I DESERVE WELL I’LL JUST

DROP OVER LIKE THAT WITHOUT ANY CHANCE

FOR FAREWELL OR TO PRESS ANYONE’S HAND.

OR SAY HOW MUCH I CARED FOR YOU AND ENJOYED

YOUR COMPANY ALL THESE YEARS. IN ANY CASE

TRY NOT TO MOURN FOR ME TOO MUCH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW

I WAS HAPPY WHEN I WAS HERE.

AND REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THIS A WHILE AGO—APRIL 1984.

BUT BE GLAD FOR ME IF I CAN DIE IN THE PRESENCE

OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IF THIS HAPPENS BELIEVE ME

I CAME OUT AHEAD. I DIDN’T LOSE THIS ONE.

TO BEGIN WITH
HE TOOK A ROOM IN A PORT CITY WITH A FELLOW

CALLED SULIEMAN A. SULIEMAN AND HIS WIFE

AN AMERICAN KNOWN ONLY AS BONNIE. ONE THING

HE REMEMBERED ABOUT HIS STAY THERE

WAS HOW EVERY EVENING SULIEMAN RAPPED

AT HIS OWN FRONT DOOR BEFORE ENTERING.

SAYING “RIGHT HELLO. SULIEMAN HERE.”

AFTER THAT SULIEMAN TAKING OFF HIS SHOES.

PUTTING PITA BREAD AND HUMMUS INTO HIS MOUTH

IN THE COMPANY OF HIS SILENT WIFE.

SOMETIMES THERE WAS A PIECE OF CHICKEN

FOLLOWED BY CUCUMBERS AND TOMATOES.

THEN THEY ALL WATCHED WHAT PASSED FOR TV

IN THAT COUNTRY. BONNIE SITTING IN A CHAIR

TO HERSELF RAVING AGAINST THE JEWS.

AT ELEVEN O’CLOCK SHE WOULD SAY “WE HAVE TO SLEEP NOW.”

BUT ONCE THEY LEFT THEIR BEDROOM DOOR OPEN.

AND HE SAW SULIEMAN MAKE HIS BED ON THE FLOOR

BESIDE THE BIG BED WHERE BONNIE LAY

AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HUSBAND.

THEY SAID SOMETHING TO EACH OTHER IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

SULIEMAN ARRANGED HIS SHOES BY HIS HEAD.

BONNIE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND THEY SLEPT.

BUT THE MAN IN THE ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

COULDN’T SLEEP AT ALL. IT WAS AS IF

HE DIDN’T BELIEVE IN SLEEP ANY LONGER.

SLEEP HAD BEEN ALL RIGHT ONCE IN ITS TIME.

BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT NOW.

LYING THERE AT NIGHT EYES OPEN ARMS AT HIS SIDES

HIS THOUGHTS WENT OUT TO HIS WIFE

AND HIS CHILDREN AND EVERYTHING THAT BORE

ON THAT LEAVE-TAKING. EVEN THE SHOES

HE’D BEEN WEARING WHEN HE LEFT HIS HOUSE

AND WALKED OUT. THEY WERE THE REAL BETRAYERS

HE DECIDED. THEY’D BROUGHT HIM ALL THIS WAY

WITHOUT ONCE TRYING TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM.

FINALLY HIS THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO THIS ROOM

AND THIS HOUSE. WHERE THEY BELONGED.

WHERE HE KNEW HE WAS HOME.

WHERE A MAN SLEPT ON THE FLOOR OF HIS OWN BEDROOM.

A MAN WHO KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF HIS OWN HOUSE

ANNOUNCING HIS MEAGER ARRIVAL. SULIEMAN.

WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE ONLY AFTER KNOCKING

AND THEN TO EAT PITA BREAD AND TOMATOES

WITH HIS BITTER WIFE. BUT IN THE COURSE OF THOSE LONG NIGHTS

HE BEGAN TO ENVY SULIEMAN A LITTLE.

NOT MUCH BUT A LITTLE. AND SO WHAT IF HE DID!

SULIEMAN SLEEPING ON HIS BEDROOM FLOOR.

BUT SULIEMAN SLEEPING IN THE SAME ROOM

AT LEAST AS HIS WIFE.

MAYBE IT WAS ALL RIGHT IF SHE SNORED

AND HAD BLIND PREJUDICES. SHE WASN’T SO BAD-

LOOKING THAT MUCH WAS TRUE AND IF

SULIEMAN WOKE UP HE COULD AT LEAST

HEAR HER FROM HIS PLACE. KNOW SHE WAS THERE.

THERE MIGHT EVEN BE NIGHTS WHEN HE COULD REACH

OVER AND TOUCH HER THROUGH THE BLANKET

WITHOUT WAKING HER. BONNIE. HIS WIFE.

MAYBE IN THIS LIFE IT WAS NECESSARY TO LEARN

TO PRETEND TO BE A DOG AND SLEEP ON THE FLOOR

IN ORDER TO GET ALONG. SOMETIMES

THIS MIGHT BE NECESSARY. WHO KNOWS

ANYTHING THESE DAYS?

AT LEAST IT WAS A NEW IDEA AND SOMETHING

HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND.

OUTSIDE THE MOON REACHED OVER THE WATER

AND DISAPPEARED FINALLY. FOOTSTEPS

MOVED SLOWLY DOWN THE STREET AND CAME TO A STOP

OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW. THE STREETLIGHT

WENT OUT AND THE STEPS PASSED ON.

THE HOUSE BECAME STILL AND IN ONE WAY AT LEAST

LIKE ALL THE OTHER HOUSES—TOTALLY DARK.

HE HELD ONTO HIS BLANKET AND STARED AT THE CEILING.

HE HAD TO START OVER. TO BEGIN WITH –

THE OILY SMELL OF THE SEA THE ROTTING TOMATOES.

THE CRANES
CRANES LIFTING UP OUT OF THE MARSHLAND…

MY BROTHER BRINGS HIS FINGERS TO HIS TEMPLES

AND THEN DROPS HIS HANDS.

LIKE THAT HE WAS DEAD.

THE SATIN LINING OF AUTUMN.

O MY BROTHER! I MISS YOU NOW AND I’D LIKE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

HUG YOU LIKE A GROWN MAN

WHO KNOWS THE WORTH OF THINGS.

THE MIST OF EVENTS DRIFTS AWAY.

NOT IN THIS LIFE I TOLD YOU ONCE.

I WAS GIVEN A DIFFERENT SET OF MARCHING ORDERS.

I PLANNED TO GO MULE-BACKING ACROSS THE ISTHMUS.

BEGONE THOUGH IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF THINGS!

BUT I’LL THINK OF YOU OUT THERE

WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE STARS WE SAW AS CHILDREN.

THE CRANES WALLOP THEIR WINGS.

IN A MOMENT THEY’LL FIND TRUE NORTH.

THEN TURN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

A HAIRCUT
SO MANY IMPOSSIBLE THINGS HAVE ALREADY

HAPPENED IN THIS LIFE. HE DOESN’T THINK

TWICE WHEN SHE TELLS HIM TO GET READY:

HE’S ABOUT TO GET A HAIRCUT.

HE SITS IN THE CHAIR IN THE UPSTAIRS ROOM

THE ROOM THEY SOMETIMES JOKE AND REFER TO

AS THE LIBRARY. THERE’S A WINDOW THERE

THAT GIVES LIGHT. SNOW’S COMING

DOWN OUTSIDE AS NEWSPAPERS GO DOWN

AROUND HIS FEET. SHE DRAPES A BIG

TOWEL OVER HIS SHOULDERS. THEN

GETS OUT HER SCISSORS COMB AND BRUSH.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY’VE BEEN

ALONE TOGETHER IN A WHILE—WITH NOBODY

GOING ANYWHERE OR NEEDING TO DO

ANYTHING. NOT COUNTING THE GOING

TO BED WITH EACH OTHER. THAT INTIMACY.

OR BREAKFASTING TOGETHER. ANOTHER

INTIMACY. THEY BOTH GROW QUIET

AND THOUGHTFUL AS SHE CUTS HIS HAIR

AND COMBS IT AND CUTS SOME MORE.

THE SNOW KEEPS FALLING OUTSIDE.

SOON LIGHT BEGINS TO PULL AWAY FROM

THE WINDOW. HE STARES DOWN LOST AND

MUSING TRYING TO READ

SOMETHING FROM THE PAPER. SHE SAYS

“RAISE YOUR HEAD.” AND HE DOES.

AND THEN SHE SAYS “SEE WHAT YOU THINK

OF IT.” HE GOES TO LOOK

IN THE MIRROR AND IT’S FINE.

IT’S JUST THE WAY HE LIKES IT

AND HE TELLS HER SO.

IT’S LATER WHEN HE TURNS ON THE

PORCHLIGHT AND SHAKES OUT THE TOWEL

AND SEES THE CURLS AND SWATHS OF

WHITE AND DARK HAIR FLY OUT ONTO

THE SNOW AND STAY THERE

THAT HE UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING: HE’S

GROWNUP NOW A REAL GROWNUP

MIDDLE-AGED MAN. WHEN HE WAS A BOY

GOING WITH HIS DAD TO THE BARBERSHOP

OR EVEN LATER A TEENAGER HOW

COULD HE HAVE IMAGINED HIS LIFE

WOULD SOMEDAY ALLOW HIM THE PRIVILEGE OF

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TO TRAVEL WITH

AND SLEEP WITH AND TAKE HIS BREAKFAST WITH?

NOT ONLY THAT—A WOMAN WHO WOULD

QUIETLY CUT HIS HAIR IN THE AFTERNOON

IN A DARK CITY THAT LAY UNDER SNOW

3000 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE HE’D STARTED.

A WOMAN WHO COULD LOOK AT HIM

ACROSS THE TABLE AND SAY

“IT’S TIME TO PUT YOU IN THE BARBER’S

CHAIR. IT’S TIME SOMEBODY GAVE YOU

A HAIRCUT.”

HAPPINESS IN CORNWALL
HIS WIFE DIED AND HE GREW OLD

BETWEEN THE GRAVEYARD AND HIS

FRONT DOOR. WALKED WITH A GAIT.

SHOULDERS BENT. HE LET HIS CLOTHES

GO AND HIS LONG HAIR TURNED WHITE.

HIS CHILDREN FOUND HIM SOMEBODY.

A BIG MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN WITH

HEAVY SHOES WHO KNEW HOW TO

MOP WAX DUST SHOP AND CARRY IN

FIREWOOD. WHO COULD LIVE

IN A ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

PREPARE MEALS. AND SLOWLY

SLOWLY BRING THE OLD MAN AROUND

TO LISTENING TO HER READ POETRY

IN THE EVENINGS IN FRONT OF

THE FIRE. TENNYSON BROWNING

SHAKESPEARE DRINKWATER. MEN

WHOSE NAMES TAKE UP SPACE

ON THE PAGE. SHE WAS THE BUTLER

COOK HOUSEKEEPER. AND AFTER

A TIME OH NO ONE KNOWS OR CARES

WHEN THEY BEGAN TO DRESS UP

ON SUNDAYS AND STROLL THROUGH TOWN.

SHE WITH HER ARM THROUGH HIS.

SMILING. HE PROUD AND HAPPY

AND WITH HIS HAND ON HERS.

NO ONE DENIED THEM

OR TRIED TO DIMINISH THIS

IN ANY WAY. HAPPINESS IS

A RARE THING! EVENINGS HE

LISTENED TO POETRY POETRY POETRY

IN FRONT OF THE FIRE.

COULDN’T GET ENOUGH OF THAT LIFE.

AFGHANISTAN
THE SAD MUSIC OF ROADS LINED WITH LARCHES.

THE FOREST IN THE DISTANCE RESTING UNDER SNOW.

THE KHYBER PASS. ALEXANDER THE GREAT.

HISTORY AND LAPIS LAZULI.

NO BOOKS NO PICTURES NO KNICK-KNACKS PLEASE ME.

BUT SHE PLEASES ME. AND LAPIS LAZULI.

THAT BLUE STONE SHE WEARS ON HER DEAR FINGER.

THAT PLEASES ME EXCEEDINGLY.

THE BUCKET CLATTERS INTO THE WELL.

AND BRINGS UP WATER WITH A SWEET TASTE TO IT.

THE TOWPATH ALONG THE RIVER. THE FOOTPATH

THROUGH THE GROVE OF ALMONDS. MY LOVE

GOES EVERYWHERE IN HER SANDALS.

AND WEARS LAPIS LAZULI ON HER FINGER.

IN A MARINE LIGHT NEAR
SEQUIM WASHINGTON
THE GREEN FIELDS WERE BEGINNING. AND THE TALL WHITE

FARMHOUSES AFTER THE TIDAL FLATS AND THOSE LITTLE SAND CRABS

THAT WERE READY TO RUN OR ELSE TURN AND SQUARE OFF IF

WE MOVED THE ROCK THEY LIVED UNDER. THE LANGUOR

OF THAT SUBDUED AFTERNOON. THE BEAUTY OF DRIVING

THAT COUNTRY ROAD. TALKING OF PARIS OUR PARIS.

AND THEN YOU FINDING THAT PLACE IN THE BOOK

AND READING TO ME ABOUT ANNA AKHMATOVA’S STAY THERE WITH MODIGLIANI.

THEM SITTING ON A BENCH IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS

UNDER HIS ENORMOUS OLD BLACK UMBRELLA

RECITING VERLAINE TO EACH OTHER. BOTH OF THEM

“AS YET UNTOUCHED BY THEIR FUTURES.” WHEN

OUT IN THE FIELD WE SAW

A BARE-CHESTED YOUNG MAN WITH HIS TROUSERS ROLLED UP

LIKE AN ANCIENT OARSMAN. HE LOOKED AT US WITHOUT CURIOSITY.

STOOD THERE AND GAZED INDIFFERENTLY.

THEN TURNED HIS BACK TO US AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK.

AS WE PASSED LIKE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK SCYTHE

THROUGH THAT PERFECT LANDSCAPE.

EAGLES
IT WAS A SIXTEEN-INCH LING COD THAT THE EAGLE

DROPPED NEAR OUR FEET

AT THE TOP OF BAGLEY CREEK CANYON

AT THE EDGE OF THE GREEN WOODS.

PUNCTURE MARKS IN THE SIDES OF THE FISH

WHERE THE BIRD GRIPPED WITH ITS TALONS!

THAT AND A PIECE TORN OUT OF THE FISH’S BACK.

LIKE AN OLD PAINTING RECALLED

OR AN ANCIENT MEMORY COMING BACK

THAT EAGLE FLEW WITH THE FISH FROM THE STRAIT

OF JUAN DE FUCA UP THE CANYON TO WHERE

THE WOODS BEGIN AND WE STOOD WATCHING.

IT LOST THE FISH ABOVE OUR HEADS

DROPPED FOR IT MISSED IT AND SOARED ON

OVER THE VALLEY WHERE WIND BEATS ALL DAY.

WE WATCHED IT KEEP GOING UNTIL IT WAS

A SPECK THEN GONE. I PICKED UP

THE FISH. THAT MIRACULOUS LING COD.

CAME HOME FROM THE WALK AND —

WHY THE HELL NOT?—COOKED IT

LIGHTLY IN OIL AND ATE IT

WITH BOILED POTATOES AND PEAS AND BISCUITS.

OVER DINNER TALKING ABOUT EAGLES

AND AN OLDER FIERCER ORDER OF THINGS.

YESTERDAY SNOW
YESTERDAY SNOW WAS FALLING AND ALL WAS CHAOS.

I DON’T DREAM BUT IN THE NIGHT I DREAMED

A MAN OFFERED ME SOME OF HIS WHISKEY.

I WIPED THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE

AND RAISED IT TO MY LIPS.

IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE DREAMS OF FALLING

WHERE THEY SAY IF YOU DON’T WAKE UP

BEFORE YOU HIT THE GROUND

YOU’LL DIE. I WOKE UP! SWEATING.

OUTSIDE THE SNOW HAD QUIT.

BUT MY GOD IT LOOKED COLD. FEARSOME.

THE WINDOWS WERE ICE TO THE TOUCH

WHEN I TOUCHED THEM. I GOT BACK

IN BED AND LAY THERE THE REST OF THE NIGHT

AFRAID I’D SLEEP AGAIN. AND FIND

MYSELF BACK IN THAT DREAM…

THE BOTTLE RISING TO MY LIPS.

THE INDIFFERENT MAN

WAITING FOR ME TO DRINK AND PASS IT ON AGAIN.

A SKEWED MOON HANGS ON UNTIL MORNING

AND A BRILLIANT SUN.

BEFORE NOW I NEVER KNEW WHAT IT MEANT

TO “SPRING OUT OF BED.”

    ALL DAY SNOW FLOPPING OFF ROOFS.

THE CRUNCH OF TIRES AND FOOTSTEPS.

NEXT DOOR THERE’S AN OLD FELLOW SHOVELING.

EVERY SO OFTEN HE STOPS AND LEANS

ON HIS SHOVEL AND RESTS LETTING

HIS THOUGHTS GO WHERE THEY MAY.

STAYING HIS HEART.

THEN HE NODS AND GRIPS HIS SHOVEL.

GOES ON YES. GOES ON.

READING SOMETHING IN
THE RESTAURANT
THIS MORNING I REMEMBERED THE YOUNG MAN

WITH HIS BOOK READING AT A TABLE

BY THE WINDOW LAST NIGHT. READING

AMIDST THE COMING AND GOING OF DISHES

AND VOICES. NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED

UP AND PASSED HIS FINGER ACROSS

HIS LIPS AS IF PONDERING SOMETHING

OR QUIETING THE THOUGHTS INSIDE

HIS MIND THE GOING

AND COMING INSIDE HIS MIND. THEN

HE LOWERED HIS HEAD AND WENT BACK

TO READING. THAT MEMORY

GETS INTO MY HEAD THIS MORNING

WITH THE MEMORY OF

THE GIRL WHO ENTERED THE RESTAURANT

THAT TIME LONG AGO AND STOOD SHAKING HER HAIR.

THEN SAT DOWN ACROSS FROM ME

WITHOUT TAKING HER COAT OFF.

I PUT DOWN WHATEVER BOOK IT WAS

I WAS READING AND SHE AT ONCE

STARTED TO TELL ME THERE WAS

NOT A SNOWBALL’S CHANCE IN HELL

THIS THING WAS GOING TO FLY.

SHE KNEW IT. THEN I CAME AROUND

TO KNOWING IT. BUT IT WAS

HARD. THIS MORNING MY SWEET

YOU ASK ME WHAT’S NEW

IN THE WORLD. BUT MY CONCENTRATION

IS SHOT. AT THE TABLE NEXT

TO OURS A MAN LAUGHS AND LAUGHS

AND SHAKES HIS HEAD AT WHAT

ANOTHER FELLOW IS TELLING HIM.

BUT WHAT WAS THAT YOUNG MAN READING?

WHERE DID THAT WOMAN GO?

I’VE LOST MY PLACE. TELL ME WHAT IT IS

YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

A POEM NOT AGAINST SONGBIRDS
LIGHTEN UP SONGBIRDS. GIVE ME A BREAK.

NO NEED TO CARRY ON THIS WAY

EVEN IF IT IS MORNING. I NEED MORE SLEEP.

WHERE WERE YOU KEEPING YOURSELVES WHEN I WAS THIRTY?

WHEN THE HOUSE STAYED DARK AND QUIET ALL DAY

AS IF SOMEBODY HAD DIED?

AND THIS SAME SOMEBODY OR SOMEBODY ELSE

COOKED A HUGE MOROSE MEAL FOR THE SURVIVORS.

A MEAL THAT LASTED TEN YEARS.

GO ON SWEETHEARTS. COME BACK IN AN HOUR

MY FRIENDS. THEN I’LL BE WIDE AWAKE.

YOU’LL SEE. THIS TIME I CAN PROMISE.

LATE AFTERNOON APRIL 8 1984
A LITTLE SPORT-FISHING BOAT

    WALLOWING

IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF THE STRAIT.

I PUT THE GLASSES ON HIM.

OLD GUY IN A CANVAS HAT

LOOKING GRIM. WORRIED

AS HE SHOULD BE.

THE OTHER BOATS HAVE COME IN

LONG AGO COUNTING

THEIR BLESSINGS.

THIS FISHERMAN

HAD TO BE CLEAR OUT TO GREEN POINT

WHERE GIANT HALIBUT SCHOOL.

WHEN THE WIND STRUCK!

SUCH FORCE IT BENT THE TREES

AND CAUSED THE WATER

TO STAND UP.

AS IT’S STANDING NOW.

BUT HE’LL MAKE IT!

IF HE KEEPS THE BOW INTO

THE WIND AND IF HE’S LUCKY.

EVEN SO I LOOK UP

THE COAST GUARD EMERGENCY NUMBER.

BUT I DON’T USE IT.

I KEEP WATCHING—AN HOUR MAYBE LESS —

WHO KNOWS WHAT PASSES

THROUGH HIS MIND AND MINE

IN THAT TIME?

THEN HE TURNS IN TO THE HARBOR

WHERE AT ONCE IT GROWS CALMER.

TAKES OFF HIS HAT THEN AND WAVES IT

LIKE MAD—LIKE AN OLD-TIME COWBOY!

SOMETHING HE WON’T EVER FORGET.

YOU BETCHA.

    ME NEITHER.

MY WORK
I LOOK UP AND SEE THEM STARTING

DOWN THE BEACH. THE YOUNG MAN

IS WEARING A PACKBOARD TO CARRY THE BABY.

THIS LEAVES HIS HANDS FREE

SO THAT HE CAN TAKE ONE OF HIS WIFE’S HANDS

IN HIS AND SWING HIS OTHER. ANYONE CAN SEE

HOW HAPPY THEY ARE. AND INTIMATE. HOW STEADY.

THEY ARE HAPPIER THAN ANYONE ELSE AND THEY KNOW IT.

ARE GLADDENED BY IT AND HUMBLED.

THEY WALK TO THE END OF THE BEACH

AND OUT OF SIGHT. THAT’S IT I THINK

AND RETURN TO THIS THING GOVERNING

MY LIFE. BUT IN A FEW MINUTES

THEY COME WALKING BACK ALONG THE BEACH.

THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT

IS THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED SIDES.

HE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER NOW

THE OCEAN SIDE. SHE IS ON THIS SIDE.

BUT THEY ARE STILL HOLDING HANDS. EVEN MORE

IN LOVE IF THAT’S POSSIBLE. AND IT IS.

HAVING BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME MYSELF.

THEIRS HAS BEEN A MODEST WALK FIFTEEN MINUTES

DOWN THE BEACH FIFTEEN MINUTES BACK.

THEY’VE HAD TO PICK THEIR WAY

OVER SOME ROCKS AND AROUND HUGE LOGS

TOSSED UP FROM WHEN THE SEA RAN WILD.

THEY WALK QUIETLY SLOWLY HOLDING HANDS.

THEY KNOW THE WATER IS OUT THERE

BUT THEY’RE SO HAPPY THAT THEY IGNORE IT.

THE LOVE IN THEIR YOUNG FACES. THE SURROUND OF IT.

MAYBE IT WILL LAST FOREVER. IF THEY ARE LUCKY

AND GOOD AND FOREBEARING. AND CAREFUL. IF THEY

GO ON LOVING EACH OTHER WITHOUT STINT.

ARE TRUE TO EACH OTHER—THAT MOST OF ALL.

AS THEY WILL BE OF COURSE AS THEY WILL BE

AS THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE.

I GO BACK TO MY WORK. MY WORK GOES BACK TO ME.

A WIND PICKS UP OUT OVER THE WATER.

THE TRESTLE
I’VE WASTED MY TIME THIS MORNING AND I’M DEEPLY ASHAMED.

I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT THINKING ABOUT MY DAD.

ABOUT THAT LITTLE RIVER WE USED TO FISH—BUTTE CREEK —

NEAR LAKE ALMANOR. WATER LULLED ME TO SLEEP.

IN MY DREAM IT WAS ALL I COULD DO NOT TO GET UP

AND MOVE AROUND. BUT WHEN I WOKE EARLY THIS MORNING

I WENT TO THE TELEPHONE INSTEAD. EVEN THOUGH

THE RIVER WAS FLOWING DOWN THERE IN THE VALLEY

IN THE MEADOWS MOVING THROUGH DITCH CLOVER.

FIR TREES STOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MEADOWS. AND I WAS THERE.

A KID SITTING ON A TIMBER TRESTLE LOOKING DOWN.

WATCHING MY DAD DRINK FROM HIS CUPPED HANDS.

THEN HE SAID “THIS WATER’S SO GOOD.

I WISH I COULD GIVE MY MOTHER SOME OF THIS WATER.”

MY DAD STILL LOVED HER THOUGH SHE WAS DEAD

AND HE’D BEEN AWAY FROM HER FOR A LONG TIME.

HE HAD TO WAIT SOME MORE YEARS

UNTIL HE COULD GO WHERE SHE WAS. BUT HE LOVED

THIS COUNTRY WHERE HE FOUND HIMSELF. THE WEST.

FOR THIRTY YEARS IT HAD HIM AROUND THE HEART

AND THEN IT LET HIM GO. HE WENT TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT

IN A TOWN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

AND DIDN’T WAKE UP. WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER?

I WISH MY OWN LIFE AND DEATH COULD BE SO SIMPLE.

SO THAT WHEN I WOKE ON A FINE MORNING LIKE THIS

AFTER BEING SOMEWHERE I WANTED TO BE ALL NIGHT

SOMEWHERE IMPORTANT I COULD MOVE MOST NATURALLY

AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT TO MY DESK.

SAY I DID THAT IN THE SIMPLE WAY I’VE DESCRIBED.

FROM BED TO DESK BACK TO CHILDHOOD.

FROM THERE IT’S NOT SO FAR TO THE TRESTLE.

AND FROM THE TRESTLE I COULD LOOK DOWN

AND SEE MY DAD WHEN I NEEDED TO SEE HIM.

MY DAD DRINKING THAT COLD WATER. MY SWEET FATHER.

THE RIVER ITS MEADOWS AND FIRS AND THE TRESTLE.

THAT. WHERE I ONCE STOOD.

I WISH I COULD DO THAT

WITHOUT HAVING TO PLEAD WITH MYSELF FOR IT.

AND FEEL SICK OF MYSELF

FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN LESSER THINGS.

I KNOW IT’S TIME I CHANGED MY LIFE.

THIS LIFE—THE ONE WITH ITS COMPLICATIONS

AND PHONE CALLS—IS UNBECOMING

AND A WASTE OF TIME.

I WANT TO PLUNGE MY HANDS IN CLEAR WATER. THE WAY

HE DID. AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN.

FOR TESS
OUT ON THE STRAIT THE WATER IS WHITECAPPING

AS THEY SAY HERE. IT’S ROUGH AND I’M GLAD

I’M NOT OUT. GLAD I FISHED ALL DAY

ON MORSE CREEK CASTING A RED DAREDEVIL BACK

AND FORTH. I DIDN’T CATCH ANYTHING. NO BITES

EVEN NOT ONE. BUT IT WAS OKAY. IT WAS FINE!

I CARRIED YOUR DAD’S POCKETKNIFE AND WAS FOLLOWED

FOR A WHILE BY A DOG ITS OWNER CALLED DIXIE.

AT TIMES I FELT SO HAPPY I HAD TO QUIT

FISHING. ONCE I LAY ON THE BANK WITH MY EYES CLOSED

LISTENING TO THE SOUND THE WATER MADE

AND TO THE WIND IN THE TOPS OF THE TREES. THE SAME WIND

THAT BLOWS OUT ON THE STRAIT BUT A DIFFERENT WIND TOO.

FOR A WHILE I EVEN LET MYSELF IMAGINE I HAD DIED —

AND THAT WAS ALL RIGHT AT LEAST FOR A COUPLE

OF MINUTES UNTIL IT REALLY SANK IN: DEAD.

AS I WAS LYING THERE WITH MY EYES CLOSED

JUST AFTER I’D IMAGINED WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE

IF IN FACT I NEVER GOT UP AGAIN I THOUGHT OF YOU.

I OPENED MY EYES THEN AND GOT RIGHT UP

AND WENT BACK TO BEING HAPPY AGAIN.

I’M GRATEFUL TO YOU YOU SEE. I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

ULTRAMARINE
                                                                …SICK

               WITH EXILE THEY YEARN HOMEWARD NOW THEIR EYES

               TUNED TO THE ULTRAMARINE FIRST-STAR-PIERCED DARK

               REFLECTED ON THE DARK INCOMING WAVES…

               — DEREK MAHON

               FROM “MT GABRIEL” IN ANTARCTICA (1985)


THIS MORNING
THIS MORNING WAS SOMETHING. A LITTLE SNOW

LAY ON THE GROUND. THE SUN FLOATED IN A CLEAR

BLUE SKY. THE SEA WAS BLUE AND BLUE-GREEN

AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.

SCARCELY A RIPPLE. CALM. I DRESSED AND WENT

FOR A WALK—DETERMINED NOT TO RETURN

UNTIL I TOOK IN WHAT NATURE HAD TO OFFER.

I PASSED CLOSE TO SOME OLD BENT-OVER TREES.

CROSSED A FIELD STREWN WITH ROCKS

WHERE SNOW HAD DRIFTED. KEPT GOING

UNTIL I REACHED THE BLUFF.

WHERE I GAZED AT THE SEA AND THE SKY AND

THE GULLS WHEELING OVER THE WHITE BEACH

FAR BELOW. ALL LOVELY. ALL BATHED IN A PURE

COLD LIGHT. BUT AS USUAL MY THOUGHTS

BEGAN TO WANDER. I HAD TO WILL

MYSELF TO SEE WHAT I WAS SEEING

AND NOTHING ELSE. I HAD TO TELL MYSELF THIS IS WHAT

MATTERED NOT THE OTHER. (AND I DID SEE IT

FOR A MINUTE OR TWO!) FOR A MINUTE OR TWO

IT CROWDED OUT THE USUAL MUSINGS ON

WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG—DUTY

TENDER MEMORIES THOUGHTS OF DEATH HOW I SHOULD TREAT

WITH MY FORMER WIFE. ALL THE THINGS

I HOPED WOULD GO AWAY THIS MORNING.

THE STUFF I LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. WHAT

I’VE TRAMPLED ON IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE.

BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO I DID FORGET

MYSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I KNOW I DID.

FOR WHEN I TURNED BACK I DIDN’T KNOW

WHERE I WAS. UNTIL SOME BIRDS ROSE UP

FROM THE GNARLED TREES. AND FLEW

IN THE DIRECTION I NEEDED TO BE GOING.

WHAT YOU NEED FOR PAINTING
FROM A LETTER BY RENOIR


DON’T FORGET:

PALETTE KNIFE

SCRAPING KNIFE

ESSENCE OF TURPENTINE

BRUSHES?

POINTED MARTEN-HAIR BRUSHES

FLAT HOG-HAIR BRUSHES

INDIFFERENCE TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT YOUR CANVAS.

THE ABILITY TO WORK LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE.

AN IRON WILL.

AN AFTERNOON
AS HE WRITES WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE SEA

HE FEELS THE TIP OF HIS PEN BEGIN TO TREMBLE.

THE TIDE IS GOING OUT ACROSS THE SHINGLE.

BUT IT ISN’T THAT. NO

IT’S BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT SHE CHOOSES

TO WALK INTO THE ROOM WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON.

DROWSY NOT EVEN SURE WHERE SHE IS

FOR A MOMENT. SHE WAVES THE HAIR FROM HER FOREHEAD.

SITS ON THE TOILET WITH HER EYES CLOSED

HEAD DOWN. LEGS SPRAWLED. HE SEES HER

THROUGH THE DOORWAY. MAYBE

SHE’S REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED THAT MORNING.

FOR AFTER A TIME SHE OPENS ONE EYE AND LOOKS AT HIM.

AND SWEETLY SMILES.

CIRCULATION
AND ALL AT LENGTH ARE GATHERED IN.

— LOUISE BOGAN

BY THE TIME I CAME AROUND TO FEELING PAIN

AND WOKE UP MOONLIGHT

FLOODED THE ROOM. MY ARM LAY PARALYZED

PROPPED LIKE AN OLD ANCHOR UNDER

YOUR BACK. YOU WERE IN A DREAM

YOU SAID LATER WHERE YOU’D ARRIVED

EARLY FOR THE DANCE. BUT AFTER

A MOMENT’S ANXIETY YOU WERE OKAY

BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A SIDEWALK

SALE AND THE SHOES YOU WERE WEARING

OR NOT WEARING WERE FINE FOR THAT.

“HELP ME” I SAID. AND TRIED TO HOIST

MY ARM. BUT IT JUST LAY THERE ACHING

UNABLE TO RISE ON ITS OWN. EVEN AFTER

YOU SAID “WHAT IS IT? WHAT’S WRONG?”

IT STAYED PUT—DEAF UNMOVED

BY ANY EXPRESSION OF FEAR OR AMAZEMENT.

WE SHOUTED AT IT AND GREW AFRAID

WHEN IT DIDN’T ANSWER. “IT’S GONE TO SLEEP”

I SAID AND HEARING THOSE WORDS

KNEW HOW ABSURD THIS WAS. BUT

I COULDN’T LAUGH. SOMEHOW

BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE MANAGED

TO RAISE IT. THIS CAN’T BE MY ARM

IS WHAT I KEPT THINKING AS

WE THUMPED IT SQUEEZED IT AND

PRODDED IT BACK TO LIFE. SHOOK IT

UNTIL THAT STINGING WENT AWAY.

WE SAID A FEW WORDS TO EACH OTHER.

I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT. WHATEVER

REASSURING THINGS PEOPLE

WHO LOVE EACH OTHER SAY TO EACH OTHER

GIVEN THE HOUR AND SUCH ODD

CIRCUMSTANCE. I DO REMEMBER

YOU REMARKED HOW IT WAS LIGHT

ENOUGH IN THE ROOM THAT YOU COULD SEE

CIRCLES UNDER MY EYES.

YOU SAID I NEEDED MORE REGULAR SLEEP

AND I AGREED. EACH OF US WENT

TO THE BATHROOM AND CLIMBED BACK IN BED

ON OUR RESPECTIVE SIDES.

PULLED THE COVERS UP. “GOOD NIGHT”

YOU SAID FOR THE SECOND TIME THAT NIGHT.

AND FELL ASLEEP. MAYBE

INTO THAT SAME DREAM OR ELSE ANOTHER.

I LAY UNTIL DAYBREAK HOLDING

BOTH ARMS FAST ACROSS MY CHEST.

WORKING MY FINGERS NOW AND THEN.

WHILE MY THOUGHTS KEPT CIRCLING

AROUND AND AROUND BUT ALWAYS GOING BACK

WHERE THEY’D STARTED FROM.

THAT ONE INESCAPABLE FACT: EVEN WHILE

WE UNDERTAKE THIS TRIP

THERE’S ANOTHER FAR MORE BIZARRE

WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE.

THE COBWEB
A FEW MINUTES AGO I STEPPED ONTO THE DECK

OF THE HOUSE. FROM THERE I COULD SEE AND HEAR THE WATER

AND EVERYTHING THAT’S HAPPENED TO ME ALL THESE YEARS.

IT WAS HOT AND STILL. THE TIDE WAS OUT.

NO BIRDS SANG. AS I LEANED AGAINST THE RAILING

A COBWEB TOUCHED MY FOREHEAD.

IT CAUGHT IN MY HAIR. NO ONE CAN BLAME ME THAT I TURNED

AND WENT INSIDE. THERE WAS NO WIND. THE SEA

WAS DEAD CALM. I HUNG THE COBWEB FROM THE LAMPSHADE.

WHERE I WATCH IT SHUDDER NOW AND THEN WHEN MY BREATH

TOUCHES IT. A FINE THREAD. INTRICATE.

BEFORE LONG BEFORE ANYONE REALIZES

I’LL BE GONE FROM HERE.

BALSA WOOD
MY DAD IS AT THE STOVE IN FRONT OF A PAN WITH BRAINS

AND EGGS. BUT WHO HAS ANY APPETITE

THIS MORNING? I FEEL FLIMSY AS

BALSA WOOD. SOMETHING HAS JUST BEEN SAID.

MY MOM SAID IT. WHAT WAS IT? SOMETHING

I’LL BET THAT BEARS ON MONEY. I’LL DO MY PART

IF I DON’T EAT. DAD TURNS HIS BACK ON THE STOVE.

“I’M IN A HOLE. DON’T DIG ME DEEPER.”

LIGHT LEAKS IN FROM THE WINDOW. SOMEONE’S CRYING.

THE LAST THING I RECALL IS THE SMELL

OF BURNED BRAINS AND EGGS. THE WHOLE MORNING

IS SHOVELED INTO THE GARBAGE AND MIXED

WITH OTHER THINGS. SOMETIME LATER

HE AND I DRIVE TO THE DUMP TEN MILES OUT.

WE DON’T TALK. WE THROW OUR BAGS AND CARTONS

ONTO A DARK MOUND. RATS SCREECH.

THEY WHISTLE AS THEY CRAWL OUT OF ROTTEN SACKS

DRAGGING THEIR BELLIES. WE GET BACK IN THE CAR

TO WATCH THE SMOKE AND FIRE. THE MOTOR’S RUNNING.

I SMELL THE AIRPLANE GLUE ON MY FINGERS.

HE LOOKS AT ME AS I BRING MY FINGERS TO MY NOSE.

THEN LOOKS AWAY AGAIN TOWARD TOWN.

HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING BUT CAN’T.

HE’S A MILLION MILES AWAY. WE’RE BOTH FAR AWAY

FROM THERE AND STILL SOMEONE’S CRYING. EVEN THEN

I WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT’S POSSIBLE

TO BE IN ONE PLACE. AND SOMEPLACE ELSE TOO.

THE PROJECTILE
FOR HARUKI MURAKAMI

WE SIPPED TEA. POLITELY MUSING

ON POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS

OF MY BOOKS IN YOUR COUNTRY. SLIPPED

INTO TALK OF PAIN AND HUMILIATION

YOU FIND OCCURRING AND REOCCURRING

IN MY STORIES. AND THAT ELEMENT

OF SHEER CHANCE. HOW ALL THIS TRANSLATES

IN TERMS OF SALES.

I LOOKED INTO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.

AND FOR A MINUTE I WAS 16 AGAIN

CAREENING AROUND IN THE SNOW

IN A ’50 DODGE SEDAN WITH FIVE OR SIX

BOZOS. GIVING THE FINGER

TO SOME OTHER BOZOS WHO YELLED AND PELTED

OUR CAR WITH SNOWBALLS GRAVEL OLD

TREE BRANCHES. WE SPUN AWAY SHOUTING.

AND WE WERE GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

BUT MY WINDOW WAS DOWN THREE INCHES.

ONLY THREE INCHES. I HOLLERED OUT

ONE LAST OBSCENITY. AND SAW THIS GUY

WIND UP TO THROW. FROM THIS VANTAGE

NOW I IMAGINE I SEE IT COMING. SEE IT

SPEEDING THROUGH THE AIR WHILE I WATCH

LIKE THOSE SOLDIERS IN THE FIRST PART

OF THE LAST CENTURY WATCHED CANISTERS

OF SHOT FLY IN THEIR DIRECTION

WHILE THEY STOOD UNABLE TO MOVE

FOR THE DREAD FASCINATION OF IT.

BUT I DIDN’T SEE IT. I’D ALREADY TURNED

MY HEAD TO LAUGH WITH MY PALS.

WHEN SOMETHING SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE

OF MY HEAD SO HARD IT BROKE MY EARDRUM AND FELL

IN MY LAP INTACT. A BALL OF PACKED ICE

AND SNOW. THE PAIN WAS STUPENDOUS.

AND THE HUMILIATION.

IT WAS AWFUL WHEN I BEGAN TO WEEP

IN FRONT OF THOSE TOUGH GUYS WHILE THEY

CRIED DUMB LUCK. FREAK ACCIDENT.

A CHANCE IN A MILLION!

THE GUY WHO THREW IT HE HAD TO BE AMAZED

AND PROUD OF HIMSELF WHILE HE TOOK

THE SHOUTS AND BACKSLAPS OF THE OTHERS.

HE MUST HAVE WIPED HIS HANDS ON HIS PANTS.

AND MESSED AROUND A LITTLE MORE

BEFORE GOING HOME TO SUPPER. HE GREW UP

TO HAVE HIS SHARE OF SETBACKS AND GOT LOST

IN HIS LIFE SAME AS I GOT LOST IN MINE.

HE NEVER GAVE THAT AFTERNOON

ANOTHER THOUGHT. AND WHY SHOULD HE?

SO MUCH ELSE TO THINK ABOUT ALWAYS.

WHY REMEMBER THAT STUPID CAR SLIDING

DOWN THE ROAD THEN TURNING THE CORNER

AND DISAPPEARING?

WE POLITELY RAISE OUR TEACUPS IN THE ROOM.

A ROOM THAT FOR A MINUTE SOMETHING ELSE ENTERED.

THE MAIL
ON MY DESK A PICTURE POSTCARD FROM MY SON

IN SOUTHERN FRANCE. THE MIDI

HE CALLS IT. BLUE SKIES. BEAUTIFUL HOUSES

LOADED WITH BEGONIAS. NEVERTHELESS

HE’S GOING UNDER NEEDS MONEY FAST.

NEXT TO HIS CARD A LETTER

FROM MY DAUGHTER TELLING ME HER OLD MAN

THE SPEED-FREAK IS TEARING DOWN

A MOTORCYCLE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

THEY’RE EXISTING ON OATMEAL

SHE AND HER CHILDREN. FOR GOD’S SAKE

SHE COULD USE SOME HELP.

AND THERE’S THE LETTER FROM MY MOTHER

WHO IS SICK AND LOSING HER MIND.

SHE TELLS ME SHE WON’T BE HERE

MUCH LONGER. WON’T I HELP HER MAKE

THIS ONE LAST MOVE? CAN’T I PAY

FOR HER TO HAVE A HOME OF HER OWN?

I GO OUTSIDE. THINKING TO WALK

TO THE GRAVEYARD FOR SOME COMFORT.

BUT THE SKY IS IN TURMOIL.

THE CLOUDS HUGE AND SWOLLEN WITH DARKNESS

ABOUT TO SPEW OPEN.

IT’S THEN THE POSTMAN TURNS INTO

THE DRIVE. HIS FACE

IS A REPTILE’S GLISTENING AND WORKING.

HIS HAND GOES BACK—AS IF TO STRIKE!

IT’S THE MAIL.

THE AUTOPSY ROOM
THEN I WAS YOUNG AND HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN.

FOR ANYTHING I THOUGHT. THOUGH PART OF MY JOB

AT NIGHT WAS TO CLEAN THE AUTOPSY ROOM

ONCE THE CORONER’S WORK WAS DONE. BUT NOW

AND THEN THEY KNOCKED OFF EARLY OR TOO LATE.

FOR SO HELP ME THEY LEFT THINGS OUT

ON THEIR SPECIALLY BUILT TABLE. A LITTLE BABY

STILL AS A STONE AND SNOW COLD. ANOTHER TIME

A HUGE BLACK MAN WITH WHITE HAIR WHOSE CHEST

HAD BEEN LAID OPEN. ALL HIS VITAL ORGANS

LAY IN A PAN BESIDE HIS HEAD. THE HOSE

WAS RUNNING THE OVERHEAD LIGHTS BLAZED.

AND ONE TIME THERE WAS A LEG A WOMAN’S LEG

ON THE TABLE. A PALE AND SHAPELY LEG.

I KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT WAS. I’D SEEN THEM BEFORE.

STILL IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

WHEN I WENT HOME AT NIGHT MY WIFE WOULD SAY

“SUGAR IT’S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WE’LL TRADE

THIS LIFE IN FOR ANOTHER.” BUT IT WASN’T

THAT EASY. SHE’D TAKE MY HAND BETWEEN HER HANDS

AND HOLD IT TIGHT WHILE I LEANED BACK ON THE SOFA

AND CLOSED MY EYES. THINKING OF … SOMETHING.

I DON’T KNOW WHAT. BUT I’D LET HER BRING

MY HAND TO HER BREAST. AT WHICH POINT

I’D OPEN MY EYES AND STARE AT THE CEILING OR ELSE

THE FLOOR. THEN MY FINGERS STRAYED TO HER LEG.

WHICH WAS WARM AND SHAPELY READY TO TREMBLE

AND RAISE SLIGHTLY AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH.

BUT MY MIND WAS UNCLEAR AND SHAKY. NOTHING

WAS HAPPENING. EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING. LIFE

WAS A STONE GRINDING AND SHARPENING.

WHERE THEY’D LIVED
EVERYWHERE HE WENT THAT DAY HE WALKED

IN HIS OWN PAST. KICKED THROUGH PILES

OF MEMORIES. LOOKED THROUGH WINDOWS

THAT NO LONGER BELONGED TO HIM.

WORK AND POVERTY AND SHORT CHANGE.

IN THOSE DAYS THEY’D LIVED BY THEIR WILLS

DETERMINED TO BE INVINCIBLE.

NOTHING COULD STOP THEM. NOT

FOR THE LONGEST WHILE.

                                        IN THE MOTEL ROOM

THAT NIGHT IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS

HE OPENED A CURTAIN. SAW CLOUDS

BANKED AGAINST THE MOON. HE LEANED

CLOSER TO THE GLASS. COLD AIR PASSED

THROUGH AND PUT ITS HAND OVER HIS HEART.

I LOVED YOU HE THOUGHT.

LOVED YOU WELL.

BEFORE LOVING YOU NO LONGER.

SHE LAYS HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER

AT THE CHECKOUT STAND. BUT HE WON’T

GO WITH HER AND SHAKES HIS HEAD.

SHE INSISTS! HE PAYS. SHE WALKS OUT

WITH HIM TO HIS BIG CAR TAKES ONE LOOK

LAUGHS AT IT. TOUCHES HIS CHEEK.

LEAVES HIM WITH HIS GROCERIES

STUPID
IT’S WHAT THE KIDS NOWADAYS CALL WEED. AND IT DRIFTS

LIKE CLOUDS FROM HIS LIPS. HE HOPES NO ONE

COMES ALONG TONIGHT OR CALLS TO ASK FOR HELP.

HELP IS WHAT HE’S MOST SHORT ON TONIGHT.

A STORM THRASHES OUTSIDE. HEAVY SEAS

WITH GALE WINDS FROM THE WEST. THE TABLE HE SITS AT

IS SAY TWO CUBITS LONG AND ONE WIDE.

THE DARKNESS IN THE ROOM TEEMS WITH INSIGHT.

COULD BE HE’LL WRITE AN ADVENTURE NOVEL. OR ELSE

A CHILDREN’S STORY. A PLAY FOR TWO FEMALE CHARACTERS

ONE OF WHOM IS BLIND. CUTTHROAT SHOULD BE COMING

INTO THE RIVER. ONE THING HE’LL DO IS LEARN

TO TIE HIS OWN FLIES. MAYBE HE SHOULD GIVE

MORE MONEY TO EACH OF HIS SURVIVING

FAMILY MEMBERS. THE ONES WHO ALREADY EXPECT A LITTLE

SOMETHING IN THE MAIL FIRST OF EACH MONTH.

EVERY TIME THEY WRITE THEY TELL HIM

THEY’RE COMING UP SHORT. HE COUNTS HEADS ON HIS FINGERS

AND FINDS THEY’RE ALL SURVIVING. SO WHAT

IF HE’D RATHER BE REMEMBERED IN THE DREAMS OF STRANGERS?

HE RAISES HIS EYES TO THE SKYLIGHTS WHERE RAIN

HAMMERS ON. AFTER A WHILE —

WHO KNOWS HOW LONG?—HIS EYES ASK

THAT THEY BE CLOSED. AND HE CLOSES THEM.

BUT THE RAIN KEEPS HAMMERING. IS THIS A CLOUDBURST?

SHOULD HE DO SOMETHING? SECURE THE HOUSE

IN SOME WAY? UNCLE BO STAYED MARRIED TO AUNT RUBY

FOR 47 YEARS. THEN HANGED HIMSELF.

HE OPENS HIS EYES AGAIN. NOTHING ADDS UP.

IT ALL ADDS UP. HOW LONG WILL THIS STORM GO ON?

UNION STREET: SAN FRANCISCO SUMMER 1975
IN THOSE DAYS WE WERE GOING PLACES. BUT THAT SUNDAY

AFTERNOON WE WERE BECALMED. SITTING AROUND A TABLE

DRINKING AND SWAPPING STORIES. A PARTY THAT’D BEEN

GOING ON AND OFF SINCE FRIDAY A YEAR AGO.

THEN GUY’S WIFE WAS DROPPED OFF IN FRONT OF THE APARTMENT

BY HER BOYFRIEND AND CAME UPSTAIRS.

IT’S GUY’S BIRTHDAY AFTER ALL GIVE OR TAKE A DAY.

THEY HAVEN’T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A WEEK

MORE OR LESS. SHE’S ALL DRESSED UP. HE EMBRACES HER

SORT OF MAKES HER A DRINK. FINDS A PLACE

FOR HER AT THE TABLE. EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW

HOW SHE IS ETC. BUT SHE IGNORES THEM ALL.

ALL THOSE ALCOHOLICS. CLEARLY SHE’S PISSED OFF

AND AS USUAL IN THE WRONG COMPANY.

WHERE THE HELL HAS GUY BEEN KEEPING HIMSELF?

SHE WANTS TO KNOW. SHE SIPS HER DRINK AND LOOKS AT HIM

AS IF HE’S BRAIN-DAMAGED. SHE SPOTS A PIMPLE

ON HIS CHIN; IT’S AN INGROWN HAIR BUT IT’S FILLED

WITH PUS FRIGHTFUL LOOKS LIKE HELL. IN FRONT

OF EVERYONE SHE SAYS “WHO HAVE YOU BEEN EATING OUT

LATELY?” STARING HARD AT HIS PIMPLE.

BEING DRUNK MYSELF I DON’T RECALL HOW HE ANSWERED.

MAYBE HE SAID “I DON’T REMEMBER WHO IT WAS;

I DIDN’T GET HER NAME.” SOMETHING SMART.

ANYWAY HIS WIFE HAS THIS KIND OF BLISTERY RASH

MAYBE IT’S COLD SORES AT THE EDGE OF HER MOUTH

SO SHE SHOULDN’T BE TALKING. PRETTY SOON

IT’S LIKE ALWAYS: THEY’RE HOLDING HANDS AND LAUGHING

LIKE THE REST OF US AT LITTLE OR NOTHING.

                         LATER IN THE LIVING ROOM

THINKING EVERYONE HAD GONE OUT FOR HAMBURGERS

SHE BLEW HIM IN FRONT OF THE TV. THEN SAID

“HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU SON OF A BITCH!” AND SLAPPED HIS

GLASSES OFF. THE GLASSES HE’D BEEN WEARING

WHILE SHE MADE LOVE TO HIM. I WALKED INTO THE ROOM

AND SAID “FRIENDS DON’T DO THIS TO EACH OTHER.”

SHE DIDN’T FLINCH A MUSCLE OR WONDER ALOUD

WHICH ROCK I’D COME OUT FROM UNDER. ALL SHE SAID WAS

“WHO ASKED YOU HOBO-URINE?” GUY PUT HIS GLASSES ON.

PULLED HIS TROUSERS UP. WE ALL WENT OUT

TO THE KITCHEN AND HAD A DRINK. THEN ANOTHER. LIKE THAT

THE WORLD HAD GONE FROM AFTERNOON TO NIGHT.

BONNARD’S NUDES
HIS WIFE. FORTY YEARS HE PAINTED HER.

AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE NUDE IN THE LAST PAINTING

THE SAME YOUNG NUDE AS THE FIRST. HIS WIFE.

AS HE REMEMBERED HER YOUNG. AS SHE WAS YOUNG.

HIS WIFE IN HER BATH. AT HER DRESSING TABLE

IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR. UNDRESSED.

HIS WIFE WITH HER HANDS UNDER HER BREASTS

LOOKING OUT ON THE GARDEN.

THE SUN BESTOWING WARMTH AND COLOR.

EVERY LIVING THING IN BLOOM THERE.

SHE YOUNG AND TREMULOUS AND MOST DESIRABLE.

WHEN SHE DIED HE PAINTED A WHILE LONGER.

A FEW LANDSCAPES. THEN DIED.

AND WAS PUT DOWN NEXT TO HER.

HIS YOUNG WIFE.

JEAN’S TV
MY LIFE’S ON AN EVEN KEEL

THESE DAYS. THOUGH WHO’S TO SAY

IT’LL NEVER WAVER AGAIN?

THIS MORNING I RECALLED

A GIRLFRIEND I HAD JUST AFTER

MY MARRIAGE BROKE UP.

A SWEET GIRL NAMED JEAN.

IN THE BEGINNING SHE HAD NO IDEA

HOW BAD THINGS WERE. IT TOOK

A WHILE. BUT SHE LOVED ME

A BUNCH ANYWAY SHE SAID.

AND I KNOW THAT’S TRUE.

SHE LET ME STAY AT HER PLACE

WHERE I CONDUCTED

THE SHABBY BUSINESS OF MY LIFE

OVER HER PHONE. SHE BOUGHT

MY BOOZE BUT TOLD ME

I WASN’T A DRUNK

LIKE THOSE OTHERS SAID.

SIGNED CHECKS FOR ME

AND LEFT THEM ON HER PILLOW

WHEN SHE WENT OFF TO WORK.

GAVE ME A PENDLETON JACKET

THAT CHRISTMAS ONE I STILL WEAR.

FOR MY PART I TAUGHT HER TO DRINK.

AND HOW TO FALL ASLEEP

WITH HER CLOTHES ON.

HOW TO WAKE UP

WEEPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

WHEN I LEFT SHE PAID TWO MONTHS’

RENT FOR ME. AND GAVE ME

HER BLACK AND WHITE TV.

WE TALKED ON THE PHONE ONCE

MONTHS LATER. SHE WAS DRUNK.

AND SURE I WAS DRUNK TOO.

THE LAST THING SHE SAID TO ME WAS

WILL I EVER SEE MY TV AGAIN?

I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM

AS IF THE TV MIGHT SUDDENLY

APPEAR IN ITS PLACE

ON THE KITCHEN CHAIR. OR ELSE

COME OUT OF A CUPBOARD

AND DECLARE ITSELF. BUT THAT TV

HAD GONE DOWN THE ROAD

WEEKS BEFORE. THE TV JEAN GAVE ME.

I DIDN’T TELL HER THAT.

I LIED OF COURSE. SOON I SAID

VERY SOON NOW.

AND PUT DOWN THE PHONE

AFTER OR BEFORE SHE HUNG UP.

BUT THOSE SLEEP-SOUNDING WORDS

OF MINE MAKING ME FEEL

I’D COME TO THE END OF A STORY.

AND NOW THIS ONE LAST FALSEHOOD

BEHIND ME

                         I COULD REST.

MESOPOTAMIA
WAKING BEFORE SUNRISE IN A HOUSE NOT MY OWN

I HEAR A RADIO PLAYING IN THE KITCHEN.

MIST DRIFTS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WHILE

A WOMAN’S VOICE GIVES THE NEWS AND THEN THE WEATHER.

I HEAR THAT AND THE SOUND OF MEAT

AS IT CONNECTS WITH HOT GREASE IN THE PAN.

I LISTEN SOME MORE HALF ASLEEP. IT’S LIKE

BUT NOT LIKE WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND LAY IN BED

IN THE DARK LISTENING TO A WOMAN CRYING

AND A MAN’S VOICE RAISED IN ANGER OR DESPAIR

THE RADIO PLAYING ALL THE WHILE. INSTEAD

WHAT I HEAR THIS MORNING IS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

SAYING “HOW MANY SUMMERS DO I HAVE LEFT?

ANSWER ME THAT.” THERE’S NO ANSWER FROM THE WOMAN

THAT I CAN HEAR. BUT WHAT COULD SHE ANSWER

GIVEN SUCH A QUESTION? IN A MINUTE

I HEAR HIS VOICE SPEAKING OF SOMEONE WHO I THINK

MUST BE LONG GONE: “THAT MAN COULD SAY

    ‘O MESOPOTAMIA!’

AND MOVE HIS AUDIENCE TO TEARS.”

I GET OUT OF BED AT ONCE AND DRAW ON MY PANTS.

ENOUGH LIGHT IN THE ROOM THAT I CAN SEE

WHERE I AM FINALLY. I’M A GROWN MAN AFTER ALL

AND THESE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS. THINGS

ARE NOT GOING WELL FOR THEM JUST NOW. OR ELSE

THEY’RE GOING BETTER THAN EVER

BECAUSE THEY’RE UP EARLY AND TALKING

ABOUT SUCH THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE

AS DEATH AND MESOPOTAMIA. IN ANY CASE

I FEEL MYSELF BEING DRAWN TO THE KITCHEN.

SO MUCH THAT IS MYSTERIOUS AND IMPORTANT

IS HAPPENING OUT THERE THIS MORNING.

THE JUNGLE
“I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS”

THE BEAUTIFUL FLIGHT ATTENDANT

SAYS. SHE CONTINUES

UP THE AISLE WITH HER TRAY AND

OUT OF HIS LIFE FOREVER

HE THINKS. OFF TO HIS LEFT

FAR BELOW SOME LIGHTS

FROM A VILLAGE HIGH

ON A HILL IN THE JUNGLE.

SO MANY IMPOSSIBLE THINGS

HAVE HAPPENED

HE ISN’T SURPRISED WHEN SHE

RETURNS TO SIT IN THE

EMPTY SEAT ACROSS FROM HIS.

“ARE YOU GETTING OFF

IN RIO OR GOING ON TO BUENOS AIRES?”

ONCE MORE SHE EXPOSES

HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS.

THE HEAVY SILVER RINGS THAT HOLD

HER FINGERS THE GOLD BRACELET

ENCIRCLING HER WRIST.

THEY ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE AIR

OVER THE STEAMING MATO GROSSO.

IT IS VERY LATE.

HE GOES ON CONSIDERING HER HANDS.

LOOKING AT HER CLASPED FINGERS.

IT’S MONTHS AFTERWARDS AND

HARD TO TALK ABOUT.

HOPE
“MY WIFE” SAID PINNEGAR “EXPECTS TO SEE ME GO TO THE DOGS
WHEN SHE LEAVES ME. IT IS HER LAST HOPE.”

— D. H. LAWRENCE
“JIMMY AND THE DESPERATE WOMAN”

SHE GAVE ME THE CAR AND TWO

HUNDRED DOLLARS. SAID SO LONG BABY.

TAKE IT EASY HEAR? SO MUCH

FOR TWENTY YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

SHE KNOWS OR THINKS SHE KNOWS

I’LL GO THROUGH THE DOUGH

IN A DAY OR TWO AND EVENTUALLY

WRECK THE CAR—WHICH WAS

IN MY NAME AND NEEDED WORK ANYWAY.

WHEN I DROVE OFF SHE AND HER BOY-

FRIEND WERE CHANGING THE LOCK

ON THE FRONT DOOR. THEY WAVED.

I WAVED BACK TO LET THEM KNOW

I DIDN’T THINK ANY THE LESS

OF THEM. THEN SPED TOWARD

THE STATE LINE. I WAS HELL-BENT.

SHE WAS RIGHT TO THINK SO.

I WENT TO THE DOGS AND WE

BECAME GOOD FRIENDS.

BUT I KEPT GOING. WENT

A LONG WAY WITHOUT STOPPING.

LEFT THE DOGS MY FRIENDS BEHIND.

NEVERTHELESS WHEN I DID SHOW

MY FACE AT THAT HOUSE AGAIN

MONTHS OR YEARS LATER DRIVING

A DIFFERENT CAR SHE WEPT

WHEN SHE SAW ME AT THE DOOR.

SOBER. DRESSED IN A CLEAN SHIRT

PANTS AND BOOTS. HER LAST HOPE

BLASTED.

SHE DIDN’T HAVE A THING

TO HOPE FOR ANYMORE.

THE HOUSE BEHIND THIS ONE
THE AFTERNOON WAS ALREADY DARK AND UNNATURAL.

WHEN THIS OLD WOMAN APPEARED IN THE FIELD

IN THE RAIN CARRYING A BRIDLE.

SHE CAME UP THE ROAD TO THE HOUSE.

THE HOUSE BEHIND THIS ONE. SOMEHOW

SHE KNEW ANTONIO RÍOS HAD ENTERED

THE HOUR OF HIS FINAL COMBAT.

SOMEHOW DON’T ASK ME HOW SHE KNEW.

THE DOCTOR AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE WERE WITH HIM.

BUT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE. AND SO

THE OLD WOMAN CARRIED THE BRIDLE INTO THE ROOM

AND HUNG IT ACROSS THE FOOT OF HIS BED.

THE BED WHERE HE WRITHED AND LAY DYING.

SHE WENT AWAY WITHOUT A WORD.

THIS WOMAN WHO’D ONCE BEEN YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

WHEN ANTONIO WAS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

LIMITS
ALL THAT DAY WE BANGED AT GEESE

FROM A BLIND AT THE TOP

OF THE BLUFF. BUSTED ONE FLOCK

AFTER THE OTHER UNTIL OUR GUN BARRELS

GREW HOT TO THE TOUCH. GEESE

FILLED THE COLD GREY AIR. BUT WE STILL

DIDN’T KILL OUR LIMITS.

THE WIND DRIVING OUR SHOT

EVERY WHICHWAY. LATE AFTERNOON

AND WE HAD FOUR. TWO SHY

OF OUR LIMITS. THIRST DROVE US

OFF THE BLUFF AND DOWN A DIRT ROAD

ALONGSIDE THE RIVER.

TO AN EVIL-LOOKING FARM

SURROUNDED BY DEAD FIELDS OF

BARLEY. WHERE ALMOST EVENING

A MAN WITH PATCHES OF SKIN

GONE FROM HIS HANDS LET US DIP WATER

FROM A BUCKET ON HIS PORCH.

THEN ASKED IF WE WANTED TO SEE

SOMETHING—A CANADA GOOSE HE KEPT

ALIVE IN A BARREL BESIDE

THE BARN. THE BARREL COVERED OVER

WITH SCREEN WIRE RIGGED INSIDE

LIKE A LITTLE CELL. HE’D BROKEN

THE BIRD’S WING WITH A LONG SHOT

HE SAID THEN CHASED IT DOWN

AND STUFFED IT IN THE BARREL.

HE’D HAD A BRAINSTORM!

HE’D USE THAT GOOSE AS A LIVE DECOY.

IN TIME IT TURNED OUT TO BE

THE DAMNEDEST THING HE’D EVER SEEN.

IT WOULD BRING OTHER GEESE

RIGHT DOWN ON YOUR HEAD.

SO CLOSE YOU COULD ALMOST TOUCH THEM

BEFORE YOU KILLED THEM.

THIS MAN HE NEVER WANTED FOR GEESE.

AND FOR THIS HIS GOOSE WAS GIVEN

ALL THE CORN AND BARLEY

IT COULD EAT AND A BARREL

TO LIVE IN AND SHIT IN.

I TOOK A GOOD LONG LOOK AND

UNMOVING THE GOOSE LOOKED BACK.

ONLY ITS EYES TELLING ME

IT WAS ALIVE. THEN WE LEFT

MY FRIEND AND I. STILL

WILLING TO KILL ANYTHING

THAT MOVED ANYTHING THAT ROSE

OVER OUR SIGHTS. I DON’T

RECALL IF WE GOT ANYTHING ELSE

THAT DAY. I DOUBT IT.

IT WAS ALMOST DARK ANYHOW.

NO MATTER NOW. BUT FOR YEARS

AND YEARS AFTERWARDS LIVING

ON A STAPLE OF BITTERNESS I

DIDN’T FORGET THAT GOOSE.

I SET IT APART FROM ALL THE OTHERS

LIVING AND DEAD. CAME TO UNDERSTAND

ONE CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING

AND BECOME A STRANGER TO NOTHING.

SAW THAT BETRAYAL IS JUST ANOTHER WORD

FOR LOSS FOR HUNGER.

THE SENSITIVE GIRL
THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY I’VE BEEN HERE.

BUT NO JOKE THERE’S A SPIDER

ON THIS PANE OF GLASS

THAT’S BEEN AROUND EVEN LONGER. IT DOESN’T

MOVE BUT I KNOW IT’S ALIVE.

FINE WITH ME THAT LIGHTS ARE COMING ON

IN THE VALLEYS. IT’S PRETTY HERE

AND QUIET. CATTLE ARE BEING DRIVEN HOME.

IF I LISTEN I CAN HEAR COWBELLS

AND THEN THE SLAP-SLAP OF THE DRIVER’S

STICK. THERE’S HAZE

OVER THESE LUMPY SWISS HILLS. BELOW THE HOUSE

A RACE OF WATER THROUGH THE ALDERS.

JETS OF WATER TOSSED UP

SWEET AND HOPEFUL.

THERE WAS A TIME

I WOULD’VE DIED FOR LOVE.

NO MORE. THAT CENTER WOULDN’T HOLD.

IT COLLAPSED. IT GIVES OFF

NO LIGHT. ITS ORBIT

AN ORBIT OF WEARINESS. BUT I WORRY

THAT TIME AND WISH I KNEW WHY.

WHO WANTS TO REMEMBER

WHEN POVERTY AND DISGRACE PUSHED

THROUGH THE DOOR FOLLOWED BY A COP

TO INVEST THE SCENE

WITH HORRIBLE AUTHORITY?

THE LATCH WAS FASTENED BUT

THAT NEVER STOPPED ANYBODY BACK THEN.

HEY NO ONE BREATHED IN THOSE DAYS.

ASK HER IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE ME!

ASSUMING YOU COULD FIND HER AND

MAKE HER TALK. THAT GIRL WHO DREAMED

AND SANG. WHO SOMETIMES HUMMED

WHEN SHE MADE LOVE. THE SENSITIVE GIRL.

THE ONE WHO CRACKED.

I’M A GROWN MAN NOW AND THEN SOME.

SO HOW MUCH LONGER DO I HAVE?

HOW MUCH LONGER FOR THAT SPIDER?

WHERE WILL HE GO TWO DAYS INTO FALL

THE LEAVES DROPPING?

THE CATTLE HAVE ENTERED THEIR PEN.

THE MAN WITH THE STICK RAISES HIS ARM.

THEN CLOSES AND FASTENS THE GATE.

I FIND MYSELF AT LAST IN PERFECT SILENCE.

KNOWING THE LITTLE THAT IS LEFT.

KNOWING I HAVE TO LOVE IT.

WANTING TO LOVE IT. FOR BOTH OUR SAKE.

THE MINUET
BRIGHT MORNINGS.

DAYS WHEN I WANT SO MUCH I WANT NOTHING.

JUST THIS LIFE AND NO MORE. STILL

I HOPE NO ONE COMES ALONG.

BUT IF SOMEONE DOES I HOPE IT’S HER.

THE ONE WITH THE LITTLE DIAMOND STARS

AT THE TOES OF HER SHOES.

THE GIRL I SAW DANCE THE MINUET.

THAT ANTIQUE DANCE.

THE MINUET. SHE DANCED THAT

THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DANCED.

AND THE WAY SHE WANTED.

EGRESS
I OPENED THE OLD SPIRAL NOTEBOOK TO SEE WHAT I’D BEEN

THINKING IN THOSE DAYS. THERE WAS ONE ENTRY

IN A HAND I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE AS MINE BUT WAS MINE.

ALL THAT PAPER I’D LET GO TO WASTE BACK THEN!

REMOVING THE DOOR FOR DR KURBITZ.

WHAT ON EARTH COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN TO ME

OR ANYONE TODAY? THEN I WENT BACK

TO THAT TIME. TO JUST AFTER BEING MARRIED. HOW I EARNED

OUR DAILY BREAD DELIVERING FOR AL KURBITZ

THE PHARMACIST. WHOSE BROTHER KEN—DR KURBITZ

TO ME THE EAR-NOSE-AND-THROAT MAN—FELL DEAD

ONE NIGHT AFTER DINNER AFTER

TALKING OVER SOME BUSINESS DEAL. HE DIED IN THE BATHROOM

HIS BODY WEDGED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND TOILET STOOL.

BLOCKING THE WAY. FIRST THE WHUMP

OF A BODY HITTING THE FLOOR AND THEN MR KURBITZ

AND HIS SNAZZY SISTER-IN-LAW SHOUTING “KEN! KEN!”

AND PUSHING ON THE BATHROOM DOOR.

MR KURBITZ HAD TO TAKE THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES

WITH A SCREWDRIVER. IT SAVED THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS

A MINUTE MAYBE. HE SAID HIS BROTHER NEVER KNEW

WHAT HIT HIM. DEAD BEFORE HE HIT THE FLOOR.

SINCE THEN I’VE SEEN DOORS REMOVED FROM THEIR HINGES

MANY TIMES WITH AND WITHOUT THE AID OF SCREWDRIVERS.

BUT I’D FORGOTTEN ABOUT DR KURBITZ AND SO MUCH ELSE

FROM THAT TIME. NEVER UNTIL TODAY DID I CONNECT

THIS ACT WITH DYING.

                                        IN THOSE DAYS DEATH

IF IT HAPPENED HAPPENED TO OTHERS. OLD PEOPLE

BELONGING TO MY PARENTS. OR ELSE PEOPLE OF CONSEQUENCE.

PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT INCOME BRACKET WHOSE DEATH

AND REMOVAL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME OR MINE.

WE WERE LIVING IN DR COGLON’S BASEMENT

APARTMENT AND I WAS IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME

EVER. MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT. WE WERE THRILLED

BEYOND MEASURE OR ACCOUNTING FOR GIVEN OUR MEAN

SURROUNDINGS. AND THAT I’M SAYING MAY BE WHY

I NEVER WROTE MORE ABOUT DR KURBITZ

HIS BROTHER AL OR DOORS THAT HAD TO BE TAKEN OFF

THEIR HINGES FOR THE SAKE OF DEAD PEOPLE.

WHAT THE HELL! WHO NEEDED DEATH AND NOTEBOOKS? WE

WERE YOUNG AND HAPPY. DEATH WAS COMING SURE.

BUT FOR THE OLD AND WORN-OUT. OR ELSE PEOPLE IN BOOKS.

AND ONCE IN A WHILE THE WELL-HEELED PROFESSIONALS

I TREMBLED BEFORE AND SAID “YES SIR” TO.

SPELL
BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN THIS EVENING

I LAY IN THE CHANNEL OF SLEEP. ATTACHED

TO THIS WORLD BY NOTHING MORE THAN HOPE

I TURNED IN A CURRENT OF DARK DREAMS.

IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THE WEATHER

UNDERWENT A METAMORPHOSIS.

BECAME DERANGED. WHAT BEFORE HAD BEEN

VILE AND SHABBY BUT COMPREHENSIBLE

BECAME SWOLLEN AND

UNRECOGNIZABLE. SOMETHING UTTERLY VICIOUS.

IN MY DESPAIRING MOOD I DIDN’T

NEED IT. IT WAS THE LAST THING ON EARTH

I WANTED. SO WITH ALL THE POWER I COULD MUSTER

I SENT IT PACKING. SENT IT DOWN THE COAST

TO A BIG RIVER I KNOW ABOUT. A RIVER

ABLE TO DEAL WITH FOUL WEATHER

LIKE THIS. SO WHAT IF THE RIVER HAS TO FLEE

TO HIGHER GROUND? GIVE IT A FEW DAYS.

IT’LL FIND ITS WAY.

THEN ALL WILL BE AS BEFORE. I SWEAR

THIS WON’T BE MORE THAN A BAD MEMORY IF THAT.

WHY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK I WON’T REMEMBER

WHAT I WAS FEELING WHEN I WROTE THIS.

I’LL HAVE FORGOTTEN I SLEPT BADLY

AND DREAMED FOR A TIME THIS EVENING…

TO WAKE AT SEVEN O’CLOCK LOOK OUT

AT THE STORM AND AFTER THAT FIRST SHOCK —

TAKE HEART. THINK LONG AND HARD

ABOUT WHAT I WANT WHAT I COULD LET GO

OR SEND AWAY. AND THEN DO IT!

LIKE THAT. WITH WORDS AND SIGNS.

FROM THE EAST LIGHT
THE HOUSE ROCKED AND SHOUTED ALL NIGHT.

TOWARD MORNING GREW QUIET. THE CHILDREN

LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO EAT MAKE

THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CRAZY LIVING ROOM

IN ORDER TO GET TO THE CRAZY KITCHEN.

THERE’S FATHER ASLEEP ON THE COUCH.

SURE THEY STOP TO LOOK. WHO WOULDN’T?

THEY LISTEN TO HIS VIOLENT SNORES

AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD WAY OF LIFE

HAS BEGUN ONCE MORE. SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

BUT THE REAL SHOCKER WHAT MAKES THEM STARE

IS THAT THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE HAS BEEN TURNED OVER.

IT LIES ON ITS SIDE IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE.

THE TREE THEY HELPED DECORATE.

IT’S WRECKED NOW ICICLES AND CANDY CANES

LITTER THE RUG. HOW’D A THING LIKE THIS HAPPEN ANYWAY?

AND THEY SEE FATHER HAS OPENED

HIS PRESENT FROM MOTHER. IT’S A LENGTH OF ROPE

HALF-IN HALF-OUT OF ITS PRETTY BOX.

LET THEM BOTH GO HANG

THEMSELVES IS WHAT THEY’D LIKE TO SAY.

TO HELL WITH IT AND

THEM IS WHAT THEY’RE THINKING. MEANWHILE

THERE’S CEREAL IN THE CUPBOARD MILK

IN THE FRIDGE. THEY TAKE THEIR BOWLS

IN WHERE THE TV IS FIND THEIR SHOW

TRY TO FORGET ABOUT THE MESS EVERYWHERE.

UP GOES THE VOLUME. LOUDER AND THEN LOUDER.

FATHER TURNS OVER AND GROANS. THE CHILDREN LAUGH.

THEY TURN IT UP SOME MORE SO HE’LL FOR SURE KNOW

HE’S ALIVE. HE RAISES HIS HEAD. MORNING BEGINS.

A TALL ORDER
THIS OLD WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR THEM

SHE’D SEEN AND HEARD THE MOST AMAZING THINGS.

SIGHTS LIKE PLATES AND BOTTLES FLYING.

AN ASHTRAY TRAVELING LIKE A MISSILE

THAT HIT THE DOG IN THE HEAD.

ONCE SHE LET HERSELF IN AND FOUND A HUGE

SALAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING-ROOM TABLE.

IT WAS SPRINKLED WITH MOLDY CROUTONS.

THE TABLE WAS SET FOR SIX BUT NOBODY

HAD EATEN. DUST FILMED THE CUPS AND SILVER.

UPSTAIRS A MAN PLEADED

NOT TO HAVE HIS HAIR PULLED BY THE ROOTS AGAIN.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HE CRIED.

HER JOB WAS TO SET THE HOUSE IN ORDER.

AT LEAST MAKE IT LIKE SHE’D LEFT IT LAST TIME.

THAT WAS ALL. NOBODY ASKED HER OPINION

AND SHE DIDN’T GIVE IT. SHE PUT ON HER APRON.

TURNED THE HOT WATER ON FULL DROWNING OUT

THAT OTHER SOUND. HER ARMS WENT INTO THE SUDS

TO HER ELBOWS. SHE LEANED ON THE COUNTER.

AND STARED INTO THE BACKYARD WHERE THEY KEPT

THE RUSTY SWING AND JUNGLE-GYM SET.

IF SHE KEPT WATCHING SHE WAS SURE TO SEE

THE ELEPHANT STEP OUT OF THE TREES AND TRUMPET

AS IT DID EVERY MONDAY AT THIS HOUSE AT THIS HOUR.

THE AUTHOR OF HER MISFORTUNE
FOR THE WORLD IS THE WORLD…

AND IT WRITES NO HISTORIES

THAT END IN LOVE.

— STEPHEN SPENDER

I’M NOT THE MAN SHE CLAIMS. BUT

THIS MUCH IS TRUE: THE PAST IS

DISTANT A RECEDING COASTLINE

AND WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT

A SCRIM OF RAIN OVER THE SEA-LANES.

STILL I WISH SHE WOULDN’T KEEP ON

SAYING THOSE THINGS ABOUT ME!

OVER THE LONG COURSE

EVERYTHING BUT HOPE LETS YOU GO THEN

EVEN THAT LOOSENS ITS GRIP.

THERE ISN’T ENOUGH OF ANYTHING

AS LONG AS WE LIVE. BUT AT INTERVALS

A SWEETNESS APPEARS AND GIVEN A CHANCE

PREVAILS. IT’S TRUE I’M HAPPY NOW.

AND IT’D BE NICE IF SHE

COULD HOLD HER TONGUE. STOP

HATING ME FOR BEING HAPPY.

BLAMING ME FOR HER LIFE. I’M AFRAID

I’M MIXED UP IN HER MIND

WITH SOMEONE ELSE. A YOUNG MAN

OF NO CHARACTER LIVING ON DREAMS

WHO SWORE HE’D LOVE HER FOREVER.

ONE WHO GAVE HER A RING AND A BRACELET.

WHO SAID COME WITH ME. YOU CAN TRUST ME.

THINGS TO THAT EFFECT. I’M NOT THAT MAN.

SHE HAS ME CONFUSED AS I SAID

WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

POWDER-MONKEY
WHEN MY FRIEND JOHN DUGAN THE CARPENTER

LEFT THIS WORLD FOR THE NEXT HE SEEMED

IN A TERRIBLE HURRY. HE WASN’T OF COURSE.

ALMOST NO ONE IS. BUT HE BARELY TOOK TIME

TO SAY GOODBYE. “I’LL JUST PUT THESE TOOLS AWAY”

HE SAID. THEN “SO LONG.” AND HURRIED

DOWN THE HILL TO HIS PICKUP. HE WAVED AND

I WAVED. BUT BETWEEN HERE AND DUNGENESS

WHERE HE USED TO LIVE HE DRIFTED

OVER THE CENTER LINE ONTO DEATH’S SIDE.

AND WAS DESTROYED BY A LOGGING TRUCK.

                         HE IS WORKING

UNDER THE SUN WITH HIS SHIRT OFF A BLUE

BANDANNA AROUND HIS FOREHEAD TO KEEP SWEAT FROM HIS EYES.

DRIVING NAILS. DRILLING AND PLANING LUMBER.

JOINING WOOD TOGETHER WITH OTHER WOOD.

IN EVERY WAY TAKING THE MEASURE OF THIS HOUSE.

STOPPING TO TELL A STORY NOW AND THEN

ABOUT WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG SQUIRT WORKING

AS A POWDER-MONKEY. THE CLOSE CALLS HE’D HAD

LAYING FUSES. HIS WHITE TEETH FLASHING WHEN HE LAUGHS.

THE BLOND HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE HE LOVED TO

PULL ON WHILE MUSING. “SO LONG” HE SAID.

I WANT TO IMAGINE HIM RIDING UNHARMED

TOWARD DEATH. EVEN THOUGH THE FUSE IS BURNING.

NOTHING TO DO THERE IN THE CAB

OF HIS PICKUP BUT LISTEN TO RICKY SKAGGS

PULL ON HIS MUSTACHE AND PLAN SATURDAY NIGHT.

THIS MAN WITH ALL DEATH BEFORE HIM.

RIDING UNHARMED AND UNTOUCHED

TOWARD DEATH.

EARWIGS
FOR MONA SIMPSON

YOUR DELICIOUS-LOOKING RUM CAKE COVERED WITH

ALMONDS WAS HAND-CARRIED TO MY DOOR

THIS MORNING. THE DRIVER PARKED AT THE FOOT

OF THE HILL AND CLIMBED THE STEEP PATH.

NOTHING ELSE MOVED IN THAT FROZEN LANDSCAPE.

IT WAS COLD INSIDE AND OUT. I SIGNED

FOR IT THANKED HIM WENT BACK IN.

WHERE I STRIPPED OFF THE HEAVY TAPE TORE

THE STAPLES FROM THE BAG AND INSIDE

FOUND THE CANISTER YOU’D FILLED WITH CAKE.

I SCRATCHED ADHESIVE FROM THE LID.

PRIZED IT OPEN. FOLDED BACK THE ALUMINUM FOIL.

TO CATCH THE FIRST WHIFF OF THAT SWEETNESS!

IT WAS THEN THE EARWIG APPEARED

FROM THE MOIST DEPTHS. AN EARWIG

STUFFED ON YOUR CAKE. DRUNK

FROM IT. HE WENT OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAN.

SCURRIED WILDLY ACROSS THE TABLE TO TAKE

REFUGE IN THE FRUIT BOWL. I DIDN’T KILL IT.

NOT THEN. FILLED AS I WAS WITH CONFLICTING

FEELINGS. DISGUST OF COURSE. BUT

AMAZEMENT. EVEN ADMIRATION. THIS CREATURE

THAT’D JUST MADE A 3000-MILE OVERNIGHT TRIP

BY AIR SURROUNDED BY CAKE SHAVED ALMONDS

AND THE OVERPOWERING ODOR OF RUM. CARRIED

THEN IN A TRUCK OVER A MOUNTAIN ROAD AND

PACKED UPHILL IN FREEZING WEATHER TO A HOUSE

OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC OCEAN. AN EARWIG.

I’LL LET HIM LIVE I THOUGHT. WHAT’S ONE MORE

OR LESS IN THE WORLD? THIS ONE’S SPECIAL

MAYBE. BLESSINGS ON ITS STRANGE HEAD.

I LIFTED THE CAKE FROM ITS FOIL WRAPPING

AND THREE MORE EARWIGS WENT OVER THE SIDE

OF THE CAN! FOR A MINUTE I WAS SO TAKEN

ABACK I DIDN’T KNOW IF I SHOULD KILL THEM

OR WHAT. THEN RAGE SEIZED ME AND

I PLASTERED THEM. CRUSHED THE LIFE FROM THEM

BEFORE ANY COULD GET AWAY. IT WAS A MASSACRE.

WHILE I WAS AT IT I FOUND AND DESTROYED

THE OTHER ONE UTTERLY.

I WAS JUST BEGINNING WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER.

I’M SAYING I COULD HAVE GONE ON AND ON

RENDING THEM. IF IT’S TRUE

THAT MAN IS WOLF TO MAN WHAT CAN MERE EARWIGS

EXPECT WHEN BLOODLUST IS UP?

I SAT DOWN TRYING TO QUIETEN MY HEART.

BREATH RUSHING FROM MY NOSE. I LOOKED

AROUND THE TABLE SLOWLY. READY

FOR ANYTHING. MONA I’M SORRY TO SAY THIS

BUT I COULDN’T EAT ANY OF YOUR CAKE.

I’VE PUT IT AWAY FOR LATER MAYBE.

ANYWAY THANKS. YOU’RE SWEET TO REMEMBER

ME OUT HERE ALONE THIS WINTER.

LIVING ALONE.

LIKE AN ANIMAL I THINK.

NYQUIL
CALL IT IRON DISCIPLINE. BUT FOR MONTHS

I NEVER TOOK MY FIRST DRINK

BEFORE ELEVEN P.M. NOT SO BAD

CONSIDERING. THIS WAS IN THE BEGINNING

PHASE OF THINGS. I KNEW A MAN

WHOSE DRINK OF CHOICE WAS LISTERINE.

HE WAS COMING DOWN OFF SCOTCH.

HE BOUGHT LISTERINE BY THE CASE

AND DRANK IT BY THE CASE. THE BACK SEAT

OF HIS CAR WAS PILED HIGH WITH DEAD SOLDIERS.

THOSE EMPTY BOTTLES OF LISTERINE

GLEAMING IN HIS SCALDING BACK SEAT!

THE SIGHT OF IT SENT ME HOME SOUL-SEARCHING.

I DID THAT ONCE OR TWICE. EVERYBODY DOES.

GO WAY DOWN INSIDE AND LOOK AROUND.

I SPENT HOURS THERE BUT

DIDN’T MEET ANYONE OR SEE ANYTHING

OF INTEREST. I CAME BACK TO THE HERE AND NOW

AND PUT ON MY SLIPPERS. FIXED

MYSELF A NICE GLASS OF NYQUIL.

DRAGGED A CHAIR OVER TO THE WINDOW.

WHERE I WATCHED A PALE MOON STRUGGLE TO RISE

OVER CUPERTINO CALIFORNIA.

I WAITED THROUGH HOURS OF DARKNESS WITH NYQUIL.

AND THEN SWEET JESUS! THE FIRST SLIVER

OF LIGHT.

THE POSSIBLE
I SPENT YEARS ON AND OFF IN ACADEME.

TAUGHT AT PLACES I COULDN’T GET NEAR

AS A STUDENT. BUT NEVER WROTE A LINE

ABOUT THAT TIME. NEVER. NOTHING STAYED

WITH ME IN THOSE DAYS. I WAS A STRANGER

AND AN IMPOSTOR EVEN TO MYSELF. EXCEPT

AT THAT ONE SCHOOL. THAT DISTINGUISHED

INSTITUTION IN THE MIDWEST. WHERE

MY ONLY FRIEND AND MY COLLEAGUE

THE CHAUCERIAN WAS ARRESTED FOR BEATING HIS WIFE.

AND THREATENING HER LIFE OVER THE PHONE

A MISDEMEANOR. HE WANTED TO PUT HER EYES OUT.

SET HER ON FIRE FOR CHEATING.

THE GUY SHE WAS SEEING HE WAS GOING TO HAMMER HIM

INTO THE GROUND LIKE A FENCE POST.

HE LOST HIS MIND FOR A TIME WHILE SHE MOVED AWAY

TO A NEW LIFE. THEREAFTER HE TAUGHT

HIS CLASSES WEEPING DRUNK. MORE THAN ONCE

WORE HIS LUNCH ON HIS SHIRT FRONT.

I WAS NO HELP. I WAS FADING FAST MYSELF.

BUT SEEING THE WAY HE WAS LIVING SO TO SPEAK

I UNDERSTOOD I HADN’T STRAYED SO FAR FROM HOME

AFTER ALL. MY SCHOLAR-FRIEND. MY OLD PAL.

AT LONG LAST I’M OUT OF ALL THAT.

AND YOU. I PRAY YOUR HANDS ARE STEADY

AND THAT YOU’RE HAPPY TONIGHT. I HOPE SOME WOMAN

HAS JUST PUT HER HAND UNDER YOUR CLEAN COLLAR

A MINUTE AGO AND TOLD YOU SHE LOVES YOU.

BELIEVE HER IF YOU CAN FOR IT’S POSSIBLE SHE MEANS IT.

IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE TRUE AND KIND TO YOU.

ALL YOUR REMAINING DAYS.

SHIFTLESS
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BETTER THAN US WERE COMFORTABLE.

THEY LIVED IN PAINTED HOUSES WITH FLUSH TOILETS.

DROVE CARS WHOSE YEAR AND MAKE WERE RECOGNIZABLE.

THE ONES WORSE OFF WERE SORRY AND DIDN’T WORK.

THEIR STRANGE CARS SAT ON BLOCKS IN DUSTY YARDS.

THE YEARS GO BY AND EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE

GETS REPLACED. BUT THIS MUCH IS STILL TRUE —

I NEVER LIKED WORK. MY GOAL WAS ALWAYS

TO BE SHIFTLESS. I SAW THE MERIT IN THAT.

I LIKED THE IDEA OF SITTING IN A CHAIR

IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE FOR HOURS DOING NOTHING

BUT WEARING A HAT AND DRINKING COLA.

WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT?

DRAWING ON A CIGARETTE FROM TIME TO TIME.

SPITTING. MAKING THINGS OUT OF WOOD WITH A KNIFE.

WHERE’S THE HARM THERE? NOW AND THEN CALLING

THE DOGS TO HUNT RABBITS. TRY IT SOMETIME.

ONCE IN A WHILE HAILING A FAT BLOND KID LIKE ME

AND SAYING “DON’T I KNOW YOU?”

NOT “WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?”

THE YOUNG FIRE EATERS OF MEXICO CITY
THEY FILL THEIR MOUTHS WITH ALCOHOL

AND BLOW IT OVER A LIGHTED CANDLE

AT TRAFFIC SIGNS. ANYPLACE REALLY

WHERE CARS LINE UP AND THE DRIVERS

ARE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED AND LOOKING

FOR DISTRACTION—THERE YOU’LL FIND

THE YOUNG FIRE EATERS. DOING WHAT THEY DO

FOR A FEW PESOS. IF THEY’RE LUCKY.

BUT IN A YEAR THEIR LIPS

ARE SCORCHED AND THEIR THROATS RAW.

THEY HAVE NO VOICE WITHIN A YEAR.

THEY CAN’T TALK OR CRY OUT —

THESE SILENT CHILDREN WHO HUNT

THROUGH THE STREETS WITH A CANDLE

AND A BEER CAN FILLED WITH ALCOHOL.

THEY ARE CALLED MILUSOS. WHICH TRANSLATES

INTO “A THOUSAND USES.”

WHERE THE GROCERIES WENT
WHEN HIS MOTHER CALLED FOR THE SECOND TIME

THAT DAY SHE SAID:

“I DON’T HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT. I WANT

TO LAY DOWN ALL THE TIME.”

“DID YOU TAKE YOUR IRON?” HE WANTED TO KNOW.

HE SINCERELY WANTED TO KNOW. PRAYING DAILY

HOPELESSLY THAT IRON MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

“YES BUT IT JUST MAKES ME HUNGRY. AND I DON’T

HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT.”

HE POINTED OUT TO HER THEY’D SHOPPED

FOR HOURS THAT MORNING. BROUGHT HOME

EIGHTY DOLLARS’ WORTH OF FOOD TO STACK

IN HER CUPBOARDS AND THE FRIDGE.

“THERE’S NOTHING TO EAT IN THIS GODDAMN HOUSE

BUT BALONEY AND CHEESE” SHE SAID.

HER VOICE SHOOK WITH ANGER. “NOTHING!”

“AND HOW’S YOUR CAT? HOW’S KITTY DOING?”

HIS OWN VOICE SHOOK. HE NEEDED

TO GET OFF THIS SUBJECT OF FOOD; IT NEVER

BROUGHT THEM ANYTHING BUT GRIEF.

“KITTY” HIS MOTHER SAID. “HERE KITTY.

KITTY KITTY. SHE WON’T ANSWER ME HONEY.

I DON’T KNOW THIS FOR SURE BUT I THINK

SHE JUMPED INTO THE WASHING MACHINE

WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO DO A LOAD. AND BEFORE I FORGET

THAT MACHINE’S MAKING

A BANGING NOISE. I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING

THE MATTER WITH IT. KITTY! SHE WON’T

ANSWER ME. HONEY I’M AFRAID.

I’M AFRAID OF EVERYTHING. HELP ME PLEASE.

THEN YOU CAN GO BACK TO WHATEVER IT WAS

YOU WERE DOING. WHATEVER

IT WAS THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT

I HAD TO TAKE THE TROUBLE

TO BRING YOU INTO THIS WORLD.”

WHAT I CAN DO
ALL I WANT TODAY IS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THESE BIRDS

OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. THE PHONE IS UNPLUGGED

SO MY LOVED ONES CAN’T REACH OUT AND PUT THE ARM

ON ME. I’VE TOLD THEM THE WELL HAS RUN DRY.

THEY WON’T HEAR OF IT. THEY KEEP TRYING

TO GET THROUGH ANYWAY. JUST NOW I CAN’T BEAR TO KNOW

ABOUT THE CAR THAT BLEW ANOTHER GASKET.

OR THE TRAILER I THOUGHT I’D PAID FOR LONG AGO

NOW FORECLOSED ON. OR THE SON IN ITALY

WHO THREATENS TO END HIS LIFE THERE

UNLESS I KEEP PAYING THE BILLS. MY MOTHER WANTS

TO TALK TO ME TOO. WANTS TO REMIND ME AGAIN HOW IT WAS

BACK THEN. ALL THE MILK I DRANK CRADLED IN HER ARMS.

THAT OUGHT TO BE WORTH SOMETHING NOW. SHE NEEDS

ME TO PAY FOR THIS NEW MOVE OF HERS. SHE’D LIKE

TO LOOP BACK TO SACRAMENTO FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME.

EVERYBODY’S LUCK HAS GONE SOUTH. ALL I ASK

IS TO BE ALLOWED TO SIT FOR A MOMENT LONGER.

NURSING A BITE THE SHELTY DOG KEEPER GAVE ME LAST NIGHT.

AND WATCHING THESE BIRDS. WHO DON’T ASK FOR A THING

EXCEPT SUNNY WEATHER. IN A MINUTE

I’LL HAVE TO PLUG IN THE PHONE AND TRY TO SEPARATE

WHAT’S RIGHT FROM WRONG. UNTIL THEN

A DOZEN TINY BIRDS NO BIGGER THAN TEACUPS

PERCH IN THE BRANCHES OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

SUDDENLY THEY STOP SINGING AND TURN THEIR HEADS.

IT’S CLEAR THEY’VE FELT SOMETHING.

THEY DIVE INTO FLIGHT.

THE LITTLE ROOM
THERE WAS A GREAT RECKONING.

WORDS FLEW LIKE STONES THROUGH WINDOWS.

SHE YELLED AND YELLED LIKE THE ANGEL OF JUDGMENT.

THEN THE SUN SHOT UP AND A CONTRAIL

APPEARED IN THE MORNING SKY.

IN THE SUDDEN SILENCE THE LITTLE ROOM

BECAME ODDLY LONELY AS HE DRIED HER TEARS.

BECAME LIKE ALL THE OTHER LITTLE ROOMS ON EARTH

LIGHT FINDS HARD TO PENETRATE.

ROOMS WHERE PEOPLE YELL AND HURT EACH OTHER.

AND AFTERWARDS FEEL PAIN AND LONELINESS.

UNCERTAINTY. THE NEED TO COMFORT.

SWEET LIGHT
AFTER THE WINTER GRIEVING AND DULL

I FLOURISHED HERE ALL SPRING. SWEET LIGHT

BEGAN TO FILL MY CHEST. I PULLED UP

A CHAIR. SAT FOR HOURS IN FRONT OF THE SEA.

LISTENED TO THE BUOY AND LEARNED

TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BELL

AND THE SOUND OF A BELL. I WANTED

EVERYTHING BEHIND ME. I EVEN WANTED

TO BECOME INHUMAN. AND I DID THAT.

I KNOW I DID. (SHE’LL BACK ME UP ON THIS.)

I REMEMBER THE MORNING I CLOSED THE LID

ON MEMORY AND TURNED THE HANDLE.

LOCKING IT AWAY FOREVER.

NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

OUT HERE SEA. ONLY YOU AND I KNOW.

AT NIGHT CLOUDS FORM IN FRONT OF THE MOON.

BY MORNING THEY’RE GONE. AND THAT SWEET LIGHT

I SPOKE OF? THAT’S GONE TOO.

THE GARDEN
IN THE GARDEN SMALL LAUGHTER FROM YEARS AGO.

LANTERNS BURNING IN THE WILLOWS.

THE POWER OF THOSE FOUR WORDS “I LOVED A WOMAN.”

PUT THAT ON THE STONE BESIDE HIS NAME.

GOD KEEP YOU AND BE WITH YOU.

THOSE HORSES COMING INTO THE STRETCH AT RUIDOSO!

MIST RISING FROM THE MEADOW AT DAWN.

FROM THE VERANDA THE BLUE OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS.

WHAT USED TO BE WITHIN REACH OUT OF REACH.

AND IN SOME LESSER THINGS JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

ORDER ANYTHING YOU WANT! THEN LOOK FOR THE MAN

WITH THE LIMP TO GO BY. HE’LL PAY.

FROM A BREAK IN THE WALL I COULD LOOK DOWN

ON THE SHANTY LIGHTS IN THE VALLEY OF KIDRON.

VERY LITTLE SLEEP UNDER STRANGE ROOFS. HIS LIFE FAR AWAY.

PLAYING CHECKERS WITH MY DAD. THEN HE HUNTS UP

THE SHAVING SOAP THE BRUSH AND BOWL THE STRAIGHT

RAZOR AND WE DRIVE TO THE COUNTY HOSPITAL. I WATCH HIM

LATHER MY GRANDPA’S FACE. THEN SHAVE HIM.

THE DYING BODY IS A CLUMSY PARTNER.

DROPS OF WATER IN YOUR HAIR.

THE DARK YELLOW OF THE FIELDS THE BLACK AND BLUE RIVERS.

GOING OUT FOR A WALK MEANS YOU INTEND TO RETURN RIGHT?

EVENTUALLY.

THE FLAME IS GUTTERING. MARVELOUS.

THE MEETING BETWEEN GOETHE AND BEETHOVEN

TOOK PLACE IN LEIPZIG IN 1812. THEY TALKED INTO THE NIGHT

ABOUT LORD BYRON AND NAPOLEON.

SHE GOT OFF THE ROAD AND FROM THEN ON IT WAS NOTHING

BUT HARDPAN ALL THE WAY.

SHE TOOK A STICK AND IN THE DUST DREW THE HOUSE WHERE

THEY’D LIVE AND RAISE THEIR CHILDREN.

THERE WAS A DUCK POND AND A PLACE FOR HORSES.

TO WRITE ABOUT IT ONE WOULD HAVE TO WRITE IN A WAY

THAT WOULD STOP THE HEART AND MAKE ONE’S HAIR STAND ON END.

CERVANTES LOST A HAND IN THE BATTLE OF LEPANTO.

THIS WAS IN 1571 THE LAST GREAT SEA BATTLE FOUGHT

IN SHIPS MANNED BY GALLEY SLAVES.

IN THE UNUK RIVER IN KETCHIKAN THE BACKS OF THE SALMON

UNDER THE STREET LIGHTS AS THEY COME THROUGH TOWN.

STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE CHANTED A REQUIEM

AS TOLSTOY’S COFFIN WAS CARRIED ACROSS THE YARD

OF THE STATIONMASTER’S HOUSE AT ASTAPOVO AND PLACED

IN THE FREIGHT CAR. TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF SINGING

THE TRAIN SLOWLY MOVED OFF.

A HARD SAIL AND THE SAME STARS EVERYWHERE.

BUT THE GARDEN IS RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

DON’T WORRY YOUR HEART ABOUT ME MY DARLING.

WE WEAVE THE THREAD GIVEN TO US.

AND SPRING IS WITH ME.

SON
AWAKENED THIS MORNING BY A VOICE FROM MY CHILDHOOD

THAT SAYS TIME TO GET UP I GET UP.

ALL NIGHT LONG IN MY SLEEP TRYING

TO FIND A PLACE WHERE MY MOTHER COULD LIVE

AND BE HAPPY. IF YOU WANT ME TO LOSE MY MIND

THE VOICE SAYS OKAY. OTHERWISE

GET ME OUT OF HERE! I’M THE ONE TO BLAME

FOR MOVING HER TO THIS TOWN SHE HATES. RENTING

HER THE HOUSE SHE HATES.

PUTTING THOSE NEIGHBORS SHE HATES SO CLOSE.

BUYING THE FURNITURE SHE HATES.

WHY DIDN’T YOU GIVE ME MONEY INSTEAD AND LET ME SPEND IT?

I WANT TO GO BACK TO CALIFORNIA THE VOICE SAYS.

I’LL DIE IF I STAY HERE. DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE?

THERE’S NO ANSWER TO THIS OR TO ANYTHING ELSE

IN THE WORLD THIS MORNING. THE PHONE RINGS

AND RINGS. I CAN’T GO NEAR IT FOR FEAR

OF HEARING MY NAME ONCE MORE. THE SAME NAME

MY FATHER ANSWERED TO FOR 53 YEARS.

BEFORE GOING TO HIS REWARD.

HE DIED JUST AFTER SAYING “TAKE THIS

INTO THE KITCHEN SON.”

THE WORD SON ISSUING FROM HIS LIPS.

WOBBLING IN THE AIR FOR ALL TO HEAR.

KAFKA’S WATCH
FROM A LETTER

I HAVE A JOB WITH A TINY SALARY OF 80 CROWNS AND

AN INFINITE EIGHT TO NINE HOURS OF WORK.

I DEVOUR THE TIME OUTSIDE THE OFFICE LIKE A WILD BEAST.

SOMEDAY I HOPE TO SIT IN A CHAIR IN ANOTHER

COUNTRY LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT FIELDS OF SUGARCANE

OR MOHAMMEDAN CEMETERIES.

I DON’T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WORK SO MUCH AS ABOUT

THE SLUGGISHNESS OF SWAMPY TIME. THE OFFICE HOURS

CANNOT BE DIVIDED UP! I FEEL THE PRESSURE

OF THE FULL EIGHT OR NINE HOURS EVEN IN THE LAST

HALF HOUR OF THE DAY. IT’S LIKE A TRAIN RIDE

LASTING NIGHT AND DAY. IN THE END YOU’RE TOTALLY

CRUSHED. YOU NO LONGER THINK ABOUT THE STRAINING

OF THE ENGINE OR ABOUT THE HILLS OR

FLAT COUNTRYSIDE BUT ASCRIBE ALL THAT’S HAPPENING

TO YOUR WATCH ALONE. THE WATCH WHICH YOU CONTINUALLY HOLD

IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. THEN SHAKE. AND BRING SLOWLY

TO YOUR EAR IN DISBELIEF.

THE LIGHTNING SPEED OF THE PAST
THE CORPSE FOSTERS ANXIETY IN MEN WHO BELIEVE

IN THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THOSE WHO DON’T.

— ANDRÉ MALRAUX

HE BURIED HIS WIFE WHO’D DIED IN

MISERY. IN MISERY HE

TOOK TO HIS PORCH WHERE HE WATCHED

THE SUN SET AND THE MOON RISE.

THE DAYS SEEMED TO PASS ONLY TO RETURN

AGAIN. LIKE A DREAM IN WHICH ONE THINKS

I’VE ALREADY DREAMT THAT.

NOTHING HAVING ARRIVED WILL STAY.

WITH HIS KNIFE HE CUT THE SKIN

FROM AN APPLE. THE WHITE PULP BODY

OF THE APPLE DARKENED

AND TURNED BROWN THEN BLACK

BEFORE HIS EYES. THE WORN-OUT FACE OF DEATH!

THE LIGHTNING SPEED OF THE PAST.

VIGIL
THEY WAITED ALL DAY FOR THE SUN TO APPEAR. THEN

LATE IN THE AFTERNOON LIKE A GOOD PRINCE

IT SHOWED ITSELF FOR A FEW MINUTES.

BLAZING HIGH OVER THE BENCHLAND THAT LIES AT THE FOOT

OF THE PEAKS BEHIND THEIR BORROWED HOUSE.

THEN THE CLOUDS WERE DRAWN ONCE MORE.

THEY WERE HAPPY ENOUGH. BUT ALL EVENING

THE CURTAINS MADE MELANCHOLY GESTURES

SWISHING IN FRONT OF THE OPEN WINDOWS. AFTER DINNER

THEY STEPPED ONTO THE BALCONY.

WHERE THEY HEARD THE RIVER PLUNGING IN THE CANYON AND

CLOSER THE CREAK OF TREES SIGH OF BOUGHS.

THE TALL GRASSES PROMISED TO RUSTLE FOREVER.

SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS NECK. HE TOUCHED HER CHEEK.

THEN BATS CAME FROM ALL SIDES TO HARRY THEM BACK.

INSIDE THEY CLOSED THE WINDOWS. KEPT THEIR DISTANCE.

WATCHED A PROCESSION OF STARS. AND ONCE IN A WHILE

CREATURES THAT FLUNG THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF THE MOON.

IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL DEL MAYO
THE GIRL IN THE LOBBY READING A LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.

THE MAN IN THE LOBBY USING A BROOM.

THE BOY IN THE LOBBY WATERING PLANTS.

THE DESK CLERK LOOKING AT HIS NAILS.

THE WOMAN IN THE LOBBY WRITING A LETTER.

THE OLD MAN IN THE LOBBY SLEEPING IN HIS CHAIR.

THE FAN IN THE LOBBY REVOLVING SLOWLY OVERHEAD.

ANOTHER HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

SUDDENLY THE GIRL LAYS HER FINGER BETWEEN THE PAGES OF

    HER BOOK.

THE MAN LEANS ON HIS BROOM AND LOOKS.

THE BOY STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

THE DESK CLERK RAISES HIS EYES AND STARES.

THE WOMAN QUITS WRITING.

THE OLD MAN STIRS AND WAKES UP.

WHAT IS IT?

SOMEONE IS RUNNING UP FROM THE HARBOR.

SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SUN BEHIND HIM.

SOMEONE WHO IS BARECHESTED.

WAVING HIS ARMS.

IT’S CLEAR SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

THE MAN IS RUNNING STRAIGHT FOR THE HOTEL.

HIS LIPS ARE WORKING THEMSELVES INTO A SCREAM.

EVERYONE IN THE LOBBY WILL RECALL THEIR TERROR.

EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER THIS MOMENT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

BAHIA BRAZIL
THE WIND IS LEVEL NOW. BUT PAILS OF RAIN

FELL TODAY AND THE DAY BEFORE

AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT ALL THE WAY BACK

TO CREATION. THE BUILDINGS

IN THE OLD SLAVE QUARTER ARE DISSOLVING

AND NOBODY CARES. NOT THE GHOSTS

OF THE OLD SLAVES OR THE YOUNG.

THE WATER FEELS GOOD ON THEIR WHIPPED BACKS.

THEY COULD CRY WITH RELIEF.

NO SUNSETS IN THIS PLACE. LIGHT ONE MINUTE

AND THEN THE STARS COME OUT.

WE COULD LOOK ALL NIGHT IN VAIN

FOR THE BIG DIPPER. DOWN HERE

THE SOUTHERN CROSS IS OUR SIGN.

I’M SICK OF THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE!

UNEASY AND DREAMING

OF RUM THAT COULD SPLIT MY SKULL OPEN.

THERE’S A BODY LYING ON THE STAIRS.

STEP OVER IT. THE LIGHTS IN THE TOWER

HAVE GONE OUT. A SPIDER HOPS FROM THE MAN’S

HAIR. THIS LIFE. I’M SAYING IT’S ONE

AMAZING THING AFTER THE OTHER.

LINES OF MEN IN THE STREET

AS OPPOSED TO LINES OF POETRY.

CHOOSE! ARE YOU GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?

WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU? HE ANSWERED.

WELL SAY THE HOUSE WAS BURNING.

WOULD YOU SAVE THE CAT OR THE REMBRANDT?

THAT’S EASY. I DON’T HAVE A REMBRANDT

AND I DON’T HAVE A CAT. BUT I HAVE

A SORREL HORSE BACK HOME

THAT I WANT TO RIDE ONCE MORE

INTO THE HIGH COUNTRY.

SOON ENOUGH WE’LL ROT UNDER THE EARTH.

NO TRUTH TO THIS JUST A FACT.

WE WHO GAVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH

HAPPINESS WHILE ALIVE —

WE’RE GOING TO ROT. BUT WE WON’T

ROT IN THIS PLACE. NOT HERE.

ARMS SHACKLED TOGETHER.

JESUS THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A THING!

THIS LIFE. THESE SHACKLES.

I SHOULDN’T BRING IT UP.

THE PHENOMENON
I WOKE UP FEELING WIPED OUT. GOD KNOWS

WHERE I’VE BEEN ALL NIGHT BUT MY FEET HURT.

OUTSIDE MY WINDOW A PHENOMENON IS TAKING PLACE.

THE SUN AND MOON HANG SIDE-BY-SIDE OVER THE WATER.

TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. I CLIMB FROM BED

SLOWLY MUCH AS AN OLD MAN MIGHT MANEUVER

FROM HIS MUSTY BED IN MIDWINTER FINDING IT DIFFICULT

FOR A MOMENT EVEN TO MAKE WATER! I TELL MYSELF

THIS HAS TO BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.

IN A FEW YEARS NO PROBLEM. BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT

THE WINDOW AGAIN THERE’S A SUDDEN SWOOP OF FEELING.

ONCE MORE I’M ARRESTED WITH THE BEAUTY OF THIS PLACE.

I WAS LYING IF I EVER SAID ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY.

I MOVE CLOSER TO THE GLASS AND SEE IT’S HAPPENED

BETWEEN THIS THOUGHT AND THAT. THE MOON

IS GONE. SET AT LAST.

WIND
FOR RICHARD FORD

WATER PERFECTLY CALM. PERFECTLY AMAZING.

FLOCKS OF BIRDS MOVING

RESTLESSLY. MYSTERY ENOUGH IN THAT GOD KNOWS.

YOU ASK IF I HAVE THE TIME. I DO.

TIME TO GO IN. FISH NOT BITING

ANYWAY. NOTHING DOING ANYWHERE.

WHEN A MILE AWAY WE SEE WIND

MOVING ACROSS THE WATER. SIT QUIET AND

WATCH IT COME. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

JUST WIND. NOT SO STRONG. THOUGH STRONG ENOUGH.

YOU SAY “LOOK AT THAT!”

AND WE HOLD ON TO THE GUNWALES AS IT PASSES.

I FEEL IT FAN MY FACE AND EARS. FEEL IT

RUFFLE MY HAIR—SWEETER IT SEEMS

THAN ANY WOMAN’S FINGERS.

THEN TURN MY HEAD AND WATCH

IT MOVE ON DOWN THE STRAIT

DRIVING WAVES BEFORE IT.

LEAVING WAVES TO FLOP AGAINST

OUR HULL. THE BIRDS GOING CRAZY NOW.

BOAT ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE.

“JESUS” YOU SAY “I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.”

“RICHARD” I SAY —

“YOU’LL NEVER SEE THAT IN MANHATTAN MY FRIEND.”

MIGRATION
A LATE SUMMER’S DAY AND MY FRIEND ON THE COURT

WITH HIS FRIEND. BETWEEN GAMES THE OTHER REMARKS

HOW MY FRIEND’S STEP SEEMS NOT TO HAVE ANY SPRING

TO IT. HIS SERVE ISN’T SO HOT EITHER.

“YOU FEELING OKAY?” HE ASKS. “YOU HAD A CHECKUP

LATELY?” SUMMER AND THE LIVING IS EASY.

BUT MY FRIEND WENT TO SEE A DOCTOR FRIEND OF HIS.

WHO TOOK HIS ARM AND GAVE HIM THREE MONTHS NO LONGER.

WHEN I SAW HIM A DAY LATER IT

WAS IN THE AFTERNOON. HE WAS WATCHING TV.

HE LOOKED THE SAME BUT—HOW SHOULD I SAY IT? —

DIFFERENT. HE WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE TV

AND TURNED THE SOUND DOWN A LITTLE. BUT HE COULDN’T

SIT STILL. HE CIRCLED THE ROOM AGAIN AND AGAIN.

“IT’S A PROGRAM ON ANIMAL MIGRATION” HE SAID AS IF THIS

MIGHT EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

I PUT MY ARMS AROUND HIM AND GAVE HIM A HUG.

NOT THE REALLY BIG HUG I WAS CAPABLE OF. BEING AFRAID

THAT ONE OF US OR BOTH MIGHT GO TO PIECES.

AND THERE WAS THE MOMENTARY CRAZY AND DISHONORABLE

THOUGHT —

THIS MIGHT BE CATCHING.

I ASKED FOR AN ASHTRAY AND HE WAS HAPPY

TO RANGE AROUND THE HOUSE UNTIL HE FOUND ONE.

WE DIDN’T TALK. NOT THEN. TOGETHER WE FINISHED WATCHING

THE SHOW. REINDEER POLAR BEARS FISH WATERFOWL

BUTTERFLIES AND MORE. SOMETIMES THEY WENT FROM ONE

CONTINENT OR OCEAN TO ANOTHER. BUT IT WAS HARD

TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE STORY TAKING PLACE ON SCREEN.

MY FRIEND STOOD AS I RECALL THE WHOLE TIME.

WAS HE FEELING OKAY? HE FELT FINE. HE JUST COULDN’T

SEEM TO STAY STILL WAS ALL. SOMETHING CAME INTO HIS EYES

AND WENT AWAY AGAIN. “WHAT IN HELL ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?”

HE WANTED TO KNOW. BUT DIDN’T WAIT FOR AN ANSWER.

BEGAN TO WALK SOME MORE. I FOLLOWED HIM AWKWARDLY

FROM ROOM TO ROOM WHILE HE REMARKED ON THE WEATHER

HIS JOB HIS EX-WIFE HIS KIDS. SOON HE GUESSED

HE’D HAVE TO TELL THEM … SOMETHING.

“AM I REALLY GOING TO DIE?”

WHAT I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THAT AWFUL DAY

WAS HIS RESTLESSNESS AND MY CAUTIOUS HUGS—HELLO GOODBYE.

HE KEPT MOVING UNTIL

WE REACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND STOPPED.

HE PEERED OUT AND DREW BACK AS IF ASTOUNDED

IT COULD BE LIGHT OUTSIDE. A BANK OF SHADOW

FROM HIS HEDGE BLOCKED THE DRIVE. AND SHADOW FELL

FROM THE GARAGE ONTO HIS LAWN. HE WALKED ME TO THE CAR.

OUR SHOULDERS BUMPED. WE SHOOK HANDS AND I HUGGED HIM

ONCE MORE. LIGHTLY. THEN HE TURNED AND WENT BACK

PASSING QUICKLY INSIDE CLOSING THE DOOR. HIS FACE

APPEARED BEHIND THE WINDOW THEN WAS GONE.

HE’LL BE ON THE MOVE FROM NOW ON. TRAVELING NIGHT AND DAY

WITHOUT CEASE ALL OF HIM EVERY LAST EXPLODING PIECE

OF HIM. UNTIL HE REACHES A PLACE ONLY HE KNOWS ABOUT.

AN ARCTIC PLACE COLD AND FROZEN. WHERE HE THINKS

THIS IS FAR ENOUGH. THIS IS THE PLACE.

AND LIES DOWN FOR HE IS TIRED.

SLEEPING
HE SLEPT ON HIS HANDS.

ON A ROCK.

ON HIS FEET.

ON SOMEONE ELSE’S FEET.

HE SLEPT ON BUSES TRAINS IN AIRPLANES.

SLEPT ON DUTY.

SLEPT BESIDE THE ROAD.

SLEPT ON A SACK OF APPLES.

HE SLEPT IN A PAY TOILET.

IN A HAYLOFT.

IN THE SUPER DOME.

SLEPT IN A JAGUAR AND IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.

SLEPT IN THEATERS.

IN JAIL.

ON BOATS.

HE SLEPT IN LINE SHACKS AND ONCE IN A CASTLE.

SLEPT IN THE RAIN.

IN BLISTERING SUN HE SLEPT.

ON HORSEBACK.

HE SLEPT IN CHAIRS CHURCHES IN FANCY HOTELS.

HE SLEPT UNDER STRANGE ROOFS ALL HIS LIFE.

NOW HE SLEEPS UNDER THE EARTH.

SLEEPS ON AND ON.

LIKE AN OLD KING.

THE RIVER
I WADED DEEPENING INTO THE DARK WATER.

EVENING AND THE PUSH

AND SWIRL OF THE RIVER AS IT CLOSED

AROUND MY LEGS AND HELD ON.

YOUNG GRILSE BROKE WATER.

PARR DARTED ONE WAY SMOLT ANOTHER.

GRAVEL TURNED UNDER MY BOOTS AS I EDGED OUT.

WATCHED BY THE FURIOUS EYES OF KING SALMON.

THEIR IMMENSE HEADS TURNED SLOWLY

EYES BURNING WITH FURY AS THEY HUNG

IN THE DEEP CURRENT.

THEY WERE THERE. I FELT THEM THERE

AND MY SKIN PRICKLED. BUT

THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

I BRACED WITH THE WIND ON MY NECK.

FELT THE HAIR RISE

AS SOMETHING TOUCHED MY BOOT.

GREW AFRAID AT WHAT I COULDN’T SEE.

THEN OF EVERYTHING THAT FILLED MY EYES —

THAT OTHER SHORE HEAVY WITH BRANCHES

THE DARK LIP OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE BEHIND.

AND THIS RIVER THAT HAD SUDDENLY

GROWN BLACK AND SWIFT.

I DREW BREATH AND CAST ANYWAY.

PRAYED NOTHING WOULD STRIKE.

THE BEST TIME OF THE DAY
COOL SUMMER NIGHTS.

WINDOWS OPEN.

LAMPS BURNING.

FRUIT IN THE BOWL.

AND YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER.

THESE THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS IN THE DAY.

NEXT TO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS

OF COURSE. AND THE TIME

JUST BEFORE LUNCH.

AND THE AFTERNOON AND

EARLY EVENING HOURS.

BUT I DO LOVE

THESE SUMMER NIGHTS.

EVEN MORE I THINK

THAN THOSE OTHER TIMES.

THE WORK FINISHED FOR THE DAY.

AND NO ONE WHO CAN REACH US NOW.

OR EVER.

SCALE
FOR RICHARD MARIUS

IT’S AFTERNOON WHEN HE TAKES OFF

HIS CLOTHES AND LIES DOWN.

LIGHTS HIS CIGARETTE. ASHTRAY

BALANCED OVER HIS HEART.

THE CHEST RISING THEN

SINKING

AS HE DRAWS HOLDS IT

AND LETS THE SMOKE OUT IN SPURTS.

THE SHADES ARE DRAWN. HIS EYELIDS

CLOSING. IT’S LIKE AFTER SEX

A LITTLE. BUT ONLY A LITTLE.

WAVES THRASH BELOW THE HOUSE.

HE FINISHES THE CIGARETTE.

ALL THE WHILE THINKING

OF THOMAS MORE WHO

ACCORDING TO ERASMUS “LIKED EGGS”

AND NEVER LAY WITH HIS SECOND WIFE.

THE HEAD STARES DOWN AT ITS TRUNK

UNTIL IT THINKS IT HAS IT

MEMORIZED AND COULD RECOGNIZE

IT ANYWHERE EVEN IN DEATH.

BUT NOW THE DESIRE TO SLEEP

HAS LEFT HIM UTTERLY.

HE IS STILL REMEMBERING MORE

AND HIS HAIR SHIRT. AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF WEAR

HE HANDED IT OVER ALONG WITH HIS CLOAK

BEFORE EMBRACING HIS EXECUTIONER.

HE GETS UP TO RAISE THE SHADES.

LIGHT SLICES THE ROOM IN TWO.

A BOAT SLOWLY ROUNDS THE HOOK

WITH ITS SAILS LOWERED.

THERE’S A MILKY HAZE

OVER THE WATER. A SILENCE THERE.

IT’S MUCH TOO QUIET.

EVEN THE BIRDS ARE STILL.

SOMEWHERE OFF IN ANOTHER ROOM

SOMETHING HAS BEEN DECIDED.

A DECISION REACHED PAPERS SIGNED

AND PUSHED ASIDE.

HE KEEPS ON STARING AT THE BOAT.

THE EMPTY RIGGING THE DESERTED DECK.

THE BOAT RISES. MOVES CLOSER.

HE PEERS THROUGH THE GLASSES.

THE HUMAN FIGURE THE MUSIC

IT MAKES THAT’S WHAT’S MISSING

FROM THE TINY DECK.

A DECK NO BROADER THAN A LEAF.

SO HOW COULD IT SUPPORT A LIFE?

SUDDENLY THE BOAT SHUDDERS.

STOPS DEAD IN THE WATER.

HE SWEEPS THE GLASSES OVER THE DECK.

BUT AFTER A WHILE HIS ARMS GROW

UNBEARABLY HEAVY. SO HE DROPS THEM

JUST AS HE WOULD ANYTHING UNBEARABLE.

HE LAYS THE GLASSES ON THE SHELF.

BEGINS DRESSING. BUT THE IMAGE

OF THE BOAT STAYS. DRIFTING.

STAYS AWHILE LONGER. THEN BOBS AWAY.

FORGOTTEN ABOUT AS HE TAKES UP

HIS COAT. OPENS THE DOOR. GOES OUT.

COMPANY
THIS MORNING I WOKE UP TO RAIN

ON THE GLASS. AND UNDERSTOOD

THAT FOR A LONG TIME NOW

I’VE CHOSEN THE CORRUPT WHEN

I HAD A CHOICE. OR ELSE

SIMPLY THE MERELY EASY.

OVER THE VIRTUOUS. OR THE DIFFICULT.

THIS WAY OF THINKING HAPPENS

WHEN I’VE BEEN ALONE FOR DAYS.

LIKE NOW. HOURS SPENT

IN MY OWN DUMB COMPANY.

HOURS AND HOURS

MUCH LIKE A LITTLE ROOM.

WITH JUST A STRIP OF CARPET TO WALK ON.

YESTERDAY
YESTERDAY I DRESSED IN A DEAD MAN’S

WOOLEN UNDERWEAR. THEN DROVE TO THE END

OF AN ICY ROAD WHERE I PASSED

SOME TIME WITH INDIAN FISHERMEN.

I STEPPED INTO WATER OVER MY BOOTS.

SAW FOUR PINTAILS SPRING FROM THE CREEK.

NEVER MIND THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE

AND I MISSED THE PERFECT SHOT.

OR THAT MY SOCKS FROZE. I LOST TRACK

OF EVERYTHING AND DIDN’T MAKE IT BACK

FOR LUNCH. YOU COULD SAY

IT WASN’T MY DAY. BUT IT WAS!

AND TO PROVE IT I HAVE THIS LITTLE BITE

SHE GAVE ME LAST NIGHT. A BRUISE

COLORING MY LIP TODAY TO REMIND ME.

THE SCHOOLDESK
THE FISHING IN LOUGH ARROW IS PISS-POOR.

TOO MUCH RAIN TOO MUCH HIGH WATER.

THEY SAY THE MAYFLY HATCH HAS COME

AND GONE. ALL DAY I STAY PUT

BY THE WINDOW OF THE BORROWED COTTAGE

IN BALLINDOON WAITING FOR A BREAK

IN THE WEATHER. A TURF FIRE SMOKES

IN THE GRATE THOUGH NO ROMANCE

IN THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE

HERE. JUST OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AN OLD IRON

AND WOOD SCHOOLDESK KEEPS ME COMPANY.

SOMETHING IS CARVED INTO THE DESK UNDER

THE INKWELL. IT DOESN’T MATTER

WHAT; I’M NOT CURIOUS. IT’S ENOUGH

TO IMAGINE THE INSTRUMENT

THAT GOUGED THOSE LETTERS.

               MY DAD IS DEAD

AND MOTHER SLIPS IN AND OUT OF HER MIND.

I CAN’T BEGIN TO SAY HOW BAD IT IS

FOR MY GROWN-UP SON AND DAUGHTER.

THEY TOOK ONE LONG LOOK AT ME

AND TRIED TO MAKE ALL MY MISTAKES.

MORE’S THE PITY. BAD LUCK FOR THEM

MY SWEET CHILDREN. AND HAVEN’T I MENTIONED

MY FIRST WIFE YET? WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME

THAT I HAVEN’T? WELL I CAN’T ANYMORE.

SHOULDN’T ANYWAY. SHE CLAIMS

I SAY TOO MUCH AS IT IS.

SAYS SHE’S HAPPY NOW AND GRINDS HER TEETH.

SAYS THE LORD JESUS LOVES HER

AND SHE’LL GET BY. THAT LOVE

OF MY LIFE OVER AND DONE WITH. BUT WHAT

DOES THAT SAY ABOUT MY LIFE?

MY LOVED ONES ARE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY.

BUT THEY’RE IN THIS COTTAGE TOO

IN BALLINDOON. AND IN EVERY

HOTEL ROOM I WAKE UP IN THESE DAYS.

THE RAIN HAS LET UP.

AND THE SUN HAS APPEARED AND SMALL

CLOUDS OF UNEXPECTED MAYFLIES

PROVING SOMEONE WRONG. WE MOVE

TO THE DOOR IN A GROUP MY FAMILY AND I.

AND GO OUTSIDE. WHERE I BEND OVER THE DESK

AND RUN MY FINGERS ACROSS ITS ROUGH SURFACE.

SOMEONE LAUGHS SOMEONE GRINDS HER TEETH.

AND SOMEONE SOMEONE IS PLEADING WITH ME.

SAYING “FOR CHRIST’S SAKE DON’T

TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.”

AN ASS AND CART PASS DOWN THE LANE.

THE DRIVER TAKES THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH

AND RAISES HIS HAND.

THERE’S THE SMELL OF LILACS IN THE DAMP AIR.

MAYFLIES HOVER OVER THE LILACS

AND OVER THE HEADS OF MY LOVED ONES.

HUNDREDS OF MAYFLIES.

I SIT ON THE BENCH. LEAN

OVER THE DESK. I CAN REMEMBER

MYSELF WITH A PEN. IN THE BEGINNING

LOOKING AT PICTURES OF WORDS.

LEARNING TO WRITE THEM SLOWLY

ONE LETTER AT A TIME. PRESSING DOWN.

A WORD. THEN THE NEXT.

THE FEELING OF MASTERING SOMETHING.

THE EXCITEMENT OF IT.

PRESSING HARD. AT FIRST

THE DAMAGE CONFINED TO THE SURFACE.

BUT THEN DEEPER.

THESE BLOSSOMS. LILACS.

HOW THEY FILL THE AIR WITH SWEETNESS!

MAYFLIES IN THE AIR AS THE CART

GOES BY—AS THE FISH RISE.

CUTLERY
TROLLING THE COHO FLY TWENTY FEET BEHIND THE BOAT

UNDER MOONLIGHT WHEN THE HUGE SALMON HIT IT!

AND LUNGED CLEAR OF THE WATER. STOOD IT SEEMED

ON ITS TAIL. THEN FELL BACK AND WAS GONE.

SHAKEN I STEERED ON INTO THE HARBOR AS IF

NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. BUT IT HAD.

AND IT HAPPENED IN JUST THE WAY I’VE SAID.

I TOOK THE MEMORY WITH ME TO NEW YORK

AND BEYOND. TOOK IT WHEREVER I WENT.

ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE ONTO THE TERRACE

OF THE JOCKEY CLUB IN ROSARIO ARGENTINA.

WHERE I LOOK OUT ONTO THE BROAD RIVER

THAT THROWS BACK LIGHT FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS

OF THE DINING ROOM. I STAND SMOKING A CIGAR

LISTENING TO THE MURMURING OF THE OFFICERS

AND THEIR WIVES INSIDE; THE LITTLE CLASHING

SOUND OF CUTLERY AGAINST PLATES. I’M ALIVE

AND WELL NEITHER HAPPY NOR UNHAPPY

HERE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. SO I’M ALL THE MORE

ASTONISHED WHEN I RECALL THAT LOST FISH RISING

LEAVING THE WATER AND THEN RETURNING.

THE FEELING OF LOSS THAT GRIPPED ME THEN

GRIPS ME STILL. HOW CAN I COMMUNICATE WHAT I FEEL

ABOUT ANY OF THIS? INSIDE THEY GO ON

CONVERSING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.

                         I DECIDE TO WALK

ALONGSIDE THE RIVER. IT’S THE KIND OF NIGHT

THAT BRINGS MEN AND RIVERS CLOSE.

I GO FOR A WAYS THEN STOP. REALIZING

THAT I HAVEN’T BEEN CLOSE. NOT

IN THE LONGEST TIME. THERE’S BEEN

THIS WAITING THAT’S GONE ALONG WITH ME

WHEREVER I GO. BUT THE HOPE WIDENING NOW

THAT SOMETHING WILL RISE UP AND SPLASH.

I WANT TO HEAR IT AND MOVE ON.

THE PEN
THE PEN THAT TOLD THE TRUTH

WENT INTO THE WASHING MACHINE

FOR ITS TROUBLE. CAME OUT

AN HOUR LATER AND WAS TOSSED

IN THE DRYER WITH JEANS

AND A WESTERN SHIRT. DAYS PASSED

WHILE IT LAY QUIETLY ON THE DESK

UNDER THE WINDOW. LAY THERE

THINKING IT WAS FINISHED.

WITHOUT A SINGLE CONVICTION

TO ITS NAME. IT DIDN’T HAVE

THE WILL TO GO ON EVEN IF IT’D WANTED.

BUT ONE MORNING AN HOUR OR SO

BEFORE SUNRISE IT CAME TO LIFE

AND WROTE:

“THE DAMP FIELDS ASLEEP IN MOONLIGHT.”

THEN IT WAS STILL AGAIN.

ITS USEFULNESS IN THIS LIFE

CLEARLY AT AN END.

HE SHOOK IT AND WHACKED IT

ON THE DESK. THEN GAVE UP

ON IT OR NEARLY.

ONCE MORE THOUGH WITH THE GREATEST

EFFORT IT SUMMONED ITS LAST

RESERVES. THIS IS WHAT IT WROTE:

“A LIGHT WIND AND BEYOND THE WINDOW

TREES SWIMMING IN THE GOLDEN MORNING AIR.”

HE TRIED TO WRITE SOME MORE

BUT THAT WAS ALL. THE PEN

QUIT WORKING FOREVER.

BY AND BY IT WAS PUT

INTO THE STOVE ALONG WITH

OTHER JUNK. AND MUCH LATER

IT WAS ANOTHER PEN

AN UNDISTINGUISHED PEN

THAT HADN’T PROVED ITSELF

YET THAT FACILELY WROTE:

“DARKNESS GATHERS IN THE BRANCHES.

STAY INSIDE. KEEP STILL.”

THE PRIZE
HE WAS NEVER THE SAME THEY SAID AFTER THAT.

AND THEY WERE RIGHT. HE LEFT HOME GLAD FOR HIS LIFE.

FELL UNDER THE SPELL OF ITALIAN OPERA.

A GOUT STOOL WAS BUILT INTO THE FRONT OF HIS SEDAN CHAIR.

HIS FAMILY WENT ON LIVING IN A HUT WITHOUT A CHIMNEY.

ONE SEASON VERY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER FOR THEM.

WHAT DID THEY KNOW?

A RIVER WOUND THROUGH THEIR VALLEY.

AT NIGHT THE CANDLES FLICKERED BLINKING LIKE EYELASHES.

AS THOUGH TOBACCO SMOKE BURNED THEIR EYES.

BUT NOBODY SMOKED IN THAT STINKING PLACE.

NOBODY SANG OR WROTE CANTATAS.

WHEN HE DIED IT WAS THEY WHO HAD TO IDENTIFY THE BODY.

IT WAS TERRIBLE!

HIS FRIENDS COULDN’T REMEMBER HIM.

NOT EVEN WHAT HE’D LOOKED LIKE THE DAY BEFORE.

HIS FATHER SPAT AND RODE OFF TO KILL SQUIRRELS.

HIS SISTER CRADLED HIS HEAD IN HER ARMS.

HIS MOTHER WEPT AND WENT THROUGH HIS POCKETS.

NOTHING HAD CHANGED.

HE WAS BACK WHERE HE BELONGED.

AS THOUGH HE’D NEVER LEFT.

EASY ENOUGH TO SAY HE SHOULD HAVE DECLINED IT.

BUT WOULD YOU?

AN ACCOUNT
HE BEGAN THE POEM AT THE KITCHEN TABLE

ONE LEG CROSSED OVER THE OTHER.

HE WROTE FOR A TIME AS IF

ONLY HALF INTERESTED IN THE RESULT. IT WASN’T

AS IF THE WORLD DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH POEMS.

THE WORLD HAD PLENTY OF POEMS. BESIDES

HE’D BEEN AWAY FOR MONTHS.

HE HADN’T EVEN READ A POEM IN MONTHS.

WHAT KIND OF LIFE WAS THIS? A LIFE

WHERE A MAN WAS TOO BUSY EVEN TO READ POEMS?

NO LIFE AT ALL. THEN HE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW

DOWN THE HILL TO FRANK’S HOUSE.

A NICE HOUSE SITUATED NEAR THE WATER.

HE REMEMBERED FRANK OPENING HIS DOOR

EVERY MORNING AT NINE O’CLOCK.

GOING OUT FOR HIS WALKS.

HE DREW NEARER THE TABLE AND UNCROSSED HIS LEGS.

LAST NIGHT HE’D HEARD AN ACCOUNT

OF FRANK’S DEATH FROM ED ANOTHER NEIGHBOR.

A MAN THE SAME AGE AS FRANK

AND FRANK’S GOOD FRIEND. FRANK

AND HIS WIFE WATCHING TV. HILL STREET BLUES.

FRANK’S FAVORITE SHOW. WHEN HE GASPS

TWICE IS THROWN BACK IN HIS CHAIR —

“AS IF HE’D BEEN ELECTROCUTED.” THAT FAST

HE WAS DEAD. HIS COLOR DRAINING AWAY.

HE WAS GREY TURNING BLACK. BETTY RUNS

OUT OF THE HOUSE IN HER ROBE. RUNS

TO A NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE WHERE A GIRL KNOWS

SOMETHING ABOUT CPR. SHE’S WATCHING

THE SAME SHOW! THEY RUN BACK

TO FRANK’S HOUSE. FRANK TOTALLY BLACK NOW

IN HIS CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV.

THE COPS AND OTHER DESPERATE CHARACTERS

MOVING ACROSS THE SCREEN RAISING THEIR VOICES

YELLING AT EACH OTHER WHILE THIS NEIGHBOR GIRL

HAULS FRANK OUT OF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR.

TEARS OPEN HIS SHIRT. GOES TO WORK.

FRANK BEING THE FIRST REAL-LIFE VICTIM

SHE’S EVER HAD.

                         SHE PLACES HER LIPS

ON FRANK’S ICY LIPS. A DEAD MAN’S LIPS. BLACK LIPS.

AND BLACK HIS FACE AND HANDS AND ARMS.

BLACK TOO HIS CHEST WHERE THE SHIRT’S BEEN TORN

EXPOSING THE SPARSE HAIRS THAT GREW THERE.

LONG AFTER SHE MUST’VE KNOWN BETTER SHE GOES ON

WITH IT. PRESSING HER LIPS AGAINST HIS

UNRESPONSIVE LIPS. THEN STOPPING TO BEAT ON HIM

WITH CLENCHED FISTS. PRESSING HER LIPS TO HIS AGAIN

AND THEN AGAIN. EVEN AFTER IT’S TOO LATE AND IT

WAS CLEAR HE WASN’T COMING BACK SHE WENT ON WITH IT.

THIS GIRL BEATING ON HIM WITH HER FISTS CALLING

HIM EVERY NAME SHE COULD THINK OF. WEEPING

WHEN THEY TOOK HIM AWAY

FROM HER. AND SOMEONE THOUGHT TO TURN OFF

THE IMAGES PULSING ACROSS THE SCREEN.

THE MEADOW
IN THE MEADOW THIS AFTERNOON I FETCH

ANY NUMBER OF CRAZY MEMORIES. THAT

UNDERTAKER ASKING MY MOTHER DID SHE

WANT TO BUY THE ENTIRE SUIT TO BURY MY DAD IN

OR JUST THE COAT? I DON’T

HAVE TO PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THIS

OR ANYTHING ELSE. BUT HEY HE WENT

INTO THE FURNACE WEARING HIS BRITCHES.

THIS MORNING I LOOKED AT HIS PICTURE.

BIG HEAVYSET GUY IN THE LAST YEAR

OF HIS LIFE. HOLDING A MONSTER SALMON

IN FRONT OF THE SHACK WHERE HE LIVED

IN FORTUNA CALIFORNIA. MY DAD.

HE’S NOTHING NOW. REDUCED TO A CUP OF ASHES

AND SOME TINY BONES. NO WAY

IS THIS ANY WAY

TO END YOUR LIFE AS A MAN.

THOUGH AS HEMINGWAY CORRECTLY POINTED OUT

ALL STORIES IF CONTINUED FAR ENOUGH

END IN DEATH. TRULY.

LORD IT’S ALMOST FALL.

A FLOCK OF CANADA GEESE PASSES

HIGH OVERHEAD. THE LITTLE MARE LIFTS

HER HEAD SHIVERS ONCE GOES BACK

TO GRAZING. I THINK I WILL LIE DOWN

IN THIS SWEET GRASS. I’LL SHUT MY EYES

AND LISTEN TO WIND AND THE SOUND OF WINGS.

JUST DREAM FOR AN HOUR GLAD TO BE HERE

AND NOT THERE. THERE’S THAT. BUT ALSO

THE TERRIBLE UNDERSTANDING

THAT MEN I LOVED HAVE LEFT

FOR SOME OTHER LESSER PLACE.

LOAFING
I LOOKED INTO THE ROOM A MOMENT AGO

AND THIS IS WHAT I SAW —

MY CHAIR IN ITS PLACE BY THE WINDOW

THE BOOK TURNED FACEDOWN ON THE TABLE.

AND ON THE SILL THE CIGARETTE

LEFT BURNING IN ITS ASHTRAY.

MALINGERER! MY UNCLE YELLED AT ME

SO LONG AGO. HE WAS RIGHT.

I’VE SET ASIDE TIME TODAY

SAME AS EVERY DAY

FOR DOING NOTHING AT ALL.

SINEW
THE GIRL MINDING THE STORE.

SHE STANDS AT THE WINDOW

PICKING A PIECE OF PORK

FROM HER TEETH. IDLY

WATCHING THE MEN IN SERGE SUITS

WAISTCOATS AND TIES

DAPPING FOR TROUT ON LOUGH GILL

NEAR THE ISLE OF INNISFREE.

THE REMAINS OF HER MIDDAY MEAL

CONGEALING ON THE SILL.

THE AIR IS STILL AND WARM.

A CUCKOO CALLS.

CLOSE IN A MAN IN A BOAT

WEARING A HAT LOOKS

TOWARD SHORE THE LITTLE STORE

AND THE GIRL. HE LOOKS WHIPS

HIS LINE AND LOOKS SOME MORE.

SHE LEANS CLOSER TO THE GLASS.

GOES OUT THEN TO THE LAKESIDE.

BUT IT’S THE CUCKOO IN THE BUSH

THAT HAS HER ATTENTION.

THE MAN STRIKES A FISH

ALL BUSINESS NOW.

THE GIRL GOES ON WORKING

AT THE SINEW IN HER TEETH.

BUT SHE WATCHES THIS WELL-DRESSED

MAN REACHING OUT

TO SLIP A NET UNDER HIS FISH.

IN A MINUTE SHYLY HE FLOATS NEAR.

HOLDS UP HIS CATCH FOR THE GIRL’S PLEASURE.

DOFFS HIS HAT. SHE STIRS AND SMILES

A LITTLE. RAISES HER HAND.

A GESTURE WHICH STARTS THE BIRD

IN FLIGHT TOWARD INNISFREE.

THE MAN CASTS AND CASTS AGAIN.

HIS LINE CUTS THE AIR. HIS FLY

TOUCHES THE WATER AND WAITS.

BUT WHAT DOES THIS MAN

REALLY CARE FOR TROUT?

WHAT HE’LL TAKE

FROM THIS DAY IS THE MEMORY OF

A GIRL WORKING HER FINGER

INSIDE HER MOUTH AS THEIR GLANCES

MEET AND A BIRD FLIES UP.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SMILE.

IN THE STILL AFTERNOON.

WITH NOT A WORD LOST BETWEEN THEM.

WAITING
LEFT OFF THE HIGHWAY AND

DOWN THE HILL. AT THE

BOTTOM HANG ANOTHER LEFT.

KEEP BEARING LEFT. THE ROAD

WILL MAKE A Y. LEFT AGAIN.

THERE’S A CREEK ON THE LEFT.

KEEP GOING. JUST BEFORE

THE ROAD ENDS THERE’LL BE

ANOTHER ROAD. TAKE IT

AND NO OTHER. OTHERWISE

YOUR LIFE WILL BE RUINED

FOREVER. THERE’S A LOG HOUSE

WITH A SHAKE ROOF ON THE LEFT.

IT’S NOT THAT HOUSE. IT’S

THE NEXT HOUSE JUST OVER

A RISE. THE HOUSE

WHERE TREES ARE LADEN WITH

FRUIT. WHERE PHLOX FORSYTHIA

AND MARIGOLD GROW. IT’S

THE HOUSE WHERE THE WOMAN

STANDS IN THE DOORWAY

WEARING SUN IN HER HAIR. THE ONE

WHO’S BEEN WAITING

ALL THIS TIME.

THE WOMAN WHO LOVES YOU.

THE ONE WHO CAN SAY

“WHAT’S KEPT YOU?”

THE BRICKLAYER’S LUNCH HOUR

TWO BRICKLAYERS ARE SETTING THE WALLS

OF A CELLAR IN A NEW DUG OUT PATCH

OF DIRT BEHIND AN OLD HOUSE OF WOOD

WITH BROWN GABLES GROWN OVER WITH IVY

ON A SHADY STREET IN DENVER. IT IS NOON

AND ONE OF THEM WANDERS OFF. THE YOUNG

SUBORDINATE BRICKLAYER SITS IDLY FOR

A FEW MINUTES AFTER EATING A SANDWICH

AND THROWING AWAY THE PAPER BAG. HE

HAS ON DUNGAREES AND IS BARE ABOVE

THE WAIST; HE HAS YELLOW HAIR AND WEARS

A SMUDGED BUT STILL BRIGHT RED CAP

ON HIS HEAD. HE SITS IDLY ON TOP

OF THE WALL ON A LADDER THAT IS LEANED

UP BETWEEN HIS SPREAD THIGHS HIS HEAD

BENT DOWN GAZING UNINTERESTEDLY AT

THE PAPER BAG ON THE GRASS. HE DRAWS

HIS HAND ACROSS HIS BREAST AND THEN

SLOWLY RUBS HIS KNUCKLES ACROSS THE

SIDE OF HIS CHIN AND ROCKS TO AND FRO

ON THE WALL. A SMALL CAT WALKS TO HIM

ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL. HE PICKS

IT UP TAKES OFF HIS CAP AND PUTS IT

OVER THE KITTEN’S BODY FOR A MOMENT.

MEANWHILE IT IS DARKENING AS IF TO RAIN

AND THE WIND ON TOP OF THE TREES IN THE

STREET COMES THROUGH ALMOST HARSHLY.

DENVER SUMMER 1947

THE TREMBLING OF THE VEIL

TODAY OUT THE WINDOW

THE TREES SEMED LIKE LIVE

ORGANISMS ON THE MOON.

EACH BOUGH EXTENDED UPWARD

COVERED AT THE NORTH END

WITH LEAVES LIKE A GREEN

HAIRY PROTUBERANCE. I SAW

THE SCARLET-AND-PINK SHOOT-TIPS

OF BUDDING LEAVES WAVE

DELICATELY IN THE SUNLIGHT

BLOWN BY THE BREEZE

ALL THE ARMS OF THE TREES

BENDING AND STRAINING DOWNWARD

AT ONCE WHEN THE WIND

PUSHED THEM.

PATERSON AUGUST 1948

THE SHROUDED STRANGER

BARE SKIN IS MY WRINKLED SACK

WHEN HOT APOLLO HUMPS MY BACK

WHEN JACK FROST GRABS ME IN THESE RAGS

I WRAP MY LEGS WITH BURLAP BAGS

MY FLESH IS CINDER MY FACE IS SNOW

I WALK THE RAILROAD TO AND FRO

WHEN THE CITY STREETS ARE BLACK AND DEAD

THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT IS MY BED

I SUP MY SOUP FROM OLD TIN CANS

AND TAKE MY SWEETS FROM LITTLE HANDS

IN TIGER ALLEY NEAR THE JAIL

I STEAL AWAY FROM THE GARBAGE PAIL

IN DARKEST NIGHT WHERE NONE CAN SEE

DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE FACTORY

I SNEAK BAREFOOT UPON STONE

COME AND HEAR THE OLD MAN GROAN

I HIDE AND WAIT LIKE A NAKED CHILD

UNDER THE BRIDGE MY HEART GOES WILD

I SCREAM AT A FIRE ON THE RIVER BANK

I GIVE MY BODY TO AN OLD GAS TANK

I DREAM THAT I HAVE BURNING HAIR

BOILED ARMS THAT CLAW THE AIR

THE TORSO OF AN IRON KING

AND ON MY BACK A BROKEN WING

WHO’LL GO OUT WHORING INTO THE NIGHT

ON THE EYELESS ROAD IN THE SKINNY MOONLIGHT

MAID OR DOWD OR ATHLETE PROUD

MAY WANTON WITH ME IN THE SHROUD

WHO’LL COME LIE DOWN IN THE DARK WITH ME

BELLY TO BELLY AND KNEE TO KNEE

WHO’LL LOOK INTO MY HOODED EYE

WHO’LL LIE DOWN UNDER MY DARKENED THIGH?

NEW YORK 1949-1951

THE GREEN AUTOMOBILE

IF I HAD A GREEN AUTOMOBILE

I’D GO FIND MY OLD COMPANION

IN HIS HOUSE ON THE WESTERN OCEAN.

HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!

I’D HONK MY HORN AT HIS MANLY GATE

INSIDE HIS WIFE AND THREE

CHILDREN SPRAWL NAKED

ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

HE’D COME RUNNING OUT

TO MY CAR FULL OF HEROIC BEER

AND JUMP SCREAMING AT THE WHEEL

FOR HE IS THE GREATER DRIVER.

WE’D PILGRIMAGE TO THE HIGHEST MOUNT

OF OUR EARLIER ROCKY MOUNTAIN VISIONS

LAUGHING IN EACH OTHER’S ARMS

DELIGHT SURPASSING THE HIGHEST ROCKIES

AND AFTER OLD AGONY DRUNK WITH NEW YEARS

BOUNDING TOWARD THE SNOWY HORIZON

BLASTING THE DASHBOARD WITH ORIGINAL BOP

HOT ROD ON THE MOUNTAIN

WE’D BATTER UP THE CLOUDY HIGHWAY

WHERE ANGELS OF ANXIETY

CAREEN THROUGH THE TREES

AND SCREAM OUT OF THE ENGINE.

WE’D BURN ALL NIGHT ON THE JACKPINE PEAK

SEEN FROM DENVER IN THE SUMMER DARK

FORESTLIKE UNNATURAL RADIANCE

ILLUMINATING THE MOUNTAINTOP:

CHILDHOOD YOUTHTIME AGE & ETERNITY

WOULD OPEN LIKE SWEET TREES

IN THE NIGHTS OF ANOTHER SPRING

AND DUMBFOUND US WITH LOVE

FOR WE CAN SEE TOGETHER

THE BEAUTY OF SOULS

HIDDEN LIKE DIAMONDS

IN THE CLOCK OF THE WORLD

LIKE CHINESE MAGICIANS CAN

CONFOUND THE IMMORTALS

WITH OUR INTELLECTUALITY

HIDDEN IN THE MIST

IN THE GREEN AUTOMOBILE

WHICH I HAVE INVENTED

IMAGINED AND VISIONED

ON THE ROADS OF THE WORLD

MORE REAL THAN THE ENGINE

ON A TRACK IN THE DESERT

PURER THAN GREYHOUND AND

SWIFTER THAN PHYSICAL JETPLANE.

DENVER! DENVER! WE’LL RETURN

ROARING ACROSS THE CITY & COUNTY BUILDING LAWN

WHICH CATCHES THE PURE EMERALD FLAME

STREAMING IN THE WAKE OF OUR AUTO.

THIS TIME WE’LL BUY UP THE CITY!

I CASHED A GREAT CHECK IN MY SKULL BANK

TO FOUND A MIRACULOUS COLLEGE OF THE BODY

UP ON THE BUS TERMINAL ROOF.

BUT FIRST WE’LL DRIVE THE STATIONS OF DOWNTOWN

POOLHALL FLOPHOUSE JAZZJOINT JAIL

WHOREHOUSE DOWN FOLSOM

TO THE DARKEST ALLEYS OF LARIMER

PAYING RESPECTS TO DENVER’S FATHER

LOST ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS

STUPOR OF WINE AND SILENCE

HALLOWING THE SLUM OF HIS DECADES

SALUTE HIM AND HIS SAINTLY SUITCASE

OF DARK MUSCATEL DRINK

AND SMASH THE SWEET BOTTLES

ON DIESELS IN ALLEGIANCE.

THEN WE GO DRIVING DRUNK ON BOULEVARDS

WHERE ARMIES MARCH AND STILL PARADE

STAGGERING UNDER THE INVISIBLE

BANNER OF REALITY—

HURTLING THROUGH THE STREET

IN THE AUTO OF OUR FATE

WE SHARE AN ARCHANGELIC CIGARETTE

AND TELL EACH OTHER’S FORTUNES:

FAMES OF SUPERNATURAL ILLUMINATION

BLEAK RAINY GAPS OF TIME

GREAT ART LEARNED IN DESOLATION

AND WE BEAT APART AFTER SIX DECADES . . .

AND ON AN ASPHALT CROSSROAD

DEAL WITH EACH OTHER IN PRINCELY

GENTLENESS ONCE MORE RECALLING

FAMOUS DEAD TALKS OF OTHER CITIES.

THE WINDSHIELD’S FULL OF TEARS

RAIN WETS OUR NAKED BREASTS

WE KNEEL TOGETHER IN THE SHADE

AMID THE TRAFFIC OF NIGHT IN PARADISE

AND NOW RENEW THE SOLITARY VOW

WE MADE EACH OTHER TAKE

IN TEXAS ONCE:

I CAN’T INSCRIBE HERE. . . .



HOW MANY SATURDAY NIGHTS WILL BE

MADE DRUNKEN BY THIS LEGEND?

HOW WILL YOUNG DENVER COME TO MOURN

HER FORGOTTEN SEXUAL ANGEL?

HOW MANY BOYS WILL STRIKE THE BLACK PIANO

IN IMITATION OF THE EXCESS OF A NATIVE SAINT?

OR GIRLS FALL WANTON UNDER HIS SPECTRE IN THE HIGH

SCHOOLS OF MELANCHOLY NIGHT?

WHILE ALL THE TIME IN ETERNITY

IN THE WAN LIGHT OF THIS POEM’S RADIO

WE’LL SIT BEHIND FORGOTTEN SHADES

HEARKENING THE LOST JAZZ OF ALL SATURDAYS.

NEAL WE’LL BE REAL HEROES NOW

IN A WAR BETWEEN OUR COCKS AND TIME:

LET’S BE THE ANGELS OF THE WORLD’S DESIRE

AND TAKE THE WORLD TO BED WITH US BEFORE WE DIE.

SLEEPING ALONE OR WITH COMPANION

GIRL OR FAIRY SHEEP OR DREAM

I’LL FAIL OF LACKLOVE YOU SATIETY:

ALL MEN FALL OUR FATHERS FELL BEFORE

BUT RESURRECTING THAT LOST FLESH

IS BUT A MOMENT’S WORK OF MIND:

AN AGELESS MONUMENT TO LOVE

IN THE IMAGINATION:

MEMORIAL BUILT OUT OF OUR OWN BODIES

CONSUMED BY THE INVISIBLE POEM—

WE’LL SHUDDER IN DENVER AND ENDURE

THOUGH BLOOD AND WRINKLES BLIND OUR EYES.

SO THIS GREEN AUTOMOBILE:

I GIVE YOU IN FLIGHT

A PRESENT A PRESENT

FROM MY IMAGINATION.

WE WILL GO RIDING

OVER THE ROCKIES

WE’LL GO ON RIDING

ALL NIGHT LONG UNTIL DAWN

THEN BACK TO YOUR RAILROAD THE SP

YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR CHILDREN

AND BROKEN LEG DESTINY

YOU’LL RIDE DOWN THE PLAINS

IN THE MORNING: AND BACK

TO MY VISIONS MY OFFICE

AND EASTERN APARTMENT

I’LL RETURN TO NEW YORK.

THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD

IS LOVE.

UNDER THE BURDEN

OF SOLITUDE

UNDER THE BURDEN

OF DISSATISFACTION

THE WEIGHT

THE WEIGHT WE CARRY

IS LOVE.

WHO CAN DENY?

IN DREAMS

IT TOUCHES

THE BODY

IN THOUGHT

CONSTRUCTS

A MIRACLE

IN IMAGINATION

ANGUISHES

TILL BORN

IN HUMAN—

LOOKS OUT OF THE HEART

BURNING WITH PURITY—

FOR THE BURDEN OF LIFE

IS LOVE

BUT WE CARRY THE WEIGHT

WEARILY

AND SO MUST REST

IN THE ARMS OF LOVE

AT LAST

MUST REST IN THE ARMS

OF LOVE.

NO REST

WITHOUT LOVE

NO SLEEP

WITHOUT DREAMS

OF LOVE—

BE MAD OR CHILL

OBSESSED WITH ANGELS

OR MACHINES

THE FINAL WISH

IS LOVE

—CANNOT BE BITTER

CANNOT DENY

CANNOT WITHHOLD

IF DENIED:

THE WEIGHT IS TOO HEAVY

—MUST GIVE

FOR NO RETURN

AS THOUGHT

IS GIVEN

IN SOLITUDE

IN ALL THE EXCELLENCE

OF ITS EXCESS.

THE WARM BODIES

SHINE TOGETHER

IN THE DARKNESS

THE HAND MOVES

TO THE CENTER

OF THE FLESH

THE SKIN TREMBLES

IN HAPPINESS

AND THE SOUL COMES

JOYFUL TO THE EYE—

YES YES

THAT’S WHAT

I WANTED

I ALWAYS WANTED

I ALWAYS WANTED

TO RETURN

TO THE BODY

WHERE I WAS BORN.

SAN FRANCISCO 1955-1956

A SUPERMARKET IN CALIFORNIA

WHAT THOUGHTS I HAVE OF YOU TONIGHT WALT WHITMAN FOR I WALKED DOWN THE SIDESTREETS UNDER THE TREES WITH A HEADACHE SELF-CONSCIOUS LOOKING AT THE FULL MOON.

IN MY HUNGRY FATIGUE AND SHOPPING FOR IMAGES I WENT INTO THE NEON FRUIT SUPERMARKET DREAMING OF YOUR ENUMERATIONS!

WHAT PEACHES AND WHAT PENUMBRAS! WHOLE FAMILIES SHOPPING AT NIGHT! AISLES FULL OF HUSBANDS! WIVES IN THE AVOCADOS BABIES IN THE TOMATOES!—AND YOU GARCÍA LORCA WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN BY THE WATERMELONS?

I SAW YOU WALT WHITMAN CHILDLESS LONELY OLD GRUBBER POKING AMONG THE MEATS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND EYEING THE GROCERY BOYS.

I HEARD YOU ASKING QUESTIONS OF EACH: WHO KILLED THE PORK CHOPS? WHAT PRICE BANANAS? ARE YOU MY ANGEL?

I WANDERED IN AND OUT OF THE BRILLIANT STACKS OF CANS FOLLOWING YOU AND FOLLOWED IN MY IMAGINATION BY THE STORE DETECTIVE.

WE STRODE DOWN THE OPEN CORRIDORS TOGETHER IN OUR SOLITARY FANCY TASTING ARTICHOKES POSSESSING EVERY FROZEN DELICACY AND NEVER PASSING THE CASHIER.

WHERE ARE WE GOING WALT WHITMAN? THE DOORS CLOSE IN AN HOUR. WHICH WAY DOES YOUR BEARD POINT TONIGHT?

(I TOUCH YOUR BOOK AND DREAM OF OUR ODYSSEY IN THE SUPERMARKET AND FEEL ABSURD.)

WILL WE WALK ALL NIGHT THROUGH SOLITARY STREETS? THE TREES ADD SHADE TO SHADE LIGHTS OUT IN THE HOUSES WE’LL BOTH BE LONELY.

WILL WE STROLL DREAMING OF THE LOST AMERICA OF LOVE PAST BLUE AUTOMOBILES IN DRIVEWAYS HOME TO OUR SILENT COTTAGE?

AH DEAR FATHER GRAYBEARD LONELY OLD COURAGE-TEACHER WHAT AMERICA DID YOU HAVE WHEN CHARON QUIT POLING HIS FERRY AND YOU GOT OUT ON A SMOKING BANK AND STOOD WATCHING THE BOAT DISAPPEAR ON THE BLACK WATERS OF LETHE?

BERKELEY 1955

SUNFLOWER SUTRA

I WALKED ON THE BANKS OF THE TINCAN BANANA DOCK AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE HUGE SHADE OF A SOUTHERN PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE TO LOOK AT THE SUNSET OVER THE BOX HOUSE HILLS AND CRY.

JACK KEROUAC SAT BESIDE ME ON A BUSTED RUSTY IRON POLE COMPANION WE THOUGHT THE SAME THOUGHTS OF THE SOUL BLEAK AND BLUE AND SAD-EYED SURROUNDED BY THE GNARLED STEEL ROOTS OF TREES OF MACHINERY.

THE OILY WATER ON THE RIVER MIRRORED THE RED SKY SUN SANK ON TOP OF FINAL FRISCO PEAKS NO FISH IN THAT STREAM NO HERMIT IN THOSE MOUNTS JUST OURSELVES RHEUMY-EYED AND HUNG-OVER LIKE OLD BUMS ON THE RIVERBANK TIRED AND WILY.

LOOK AT THE SUNFLOWER HE SAID THERE WAS A DEAD GRAY SHADOW AGAINST THE SKY BIG AS A MAN SITTING DRY ON TOP OF A PILE OF ANCIENT SAWDUST—

—I RUSHED UP ENCHANTED—IT WAS MY FIRST SUNFLOWER MEMORIES OF BLAKE—MY VISIONS—HARLEM

AND HELLS OF THE EASTERN RIVERS BRIDGES CLANKING JOES GREASY SANDWICHES DEAD BABY CARRIAGES BLACK TREADLESS TIRES FORGOTTEN AND UNRETREADED THE POEM OF THE RIVERBANK CONDOMS & POTS STEEL KNIVES NOTHING STAINLESS ONLY THE DANK MUCK AND THE RAZOR-SHARP ARTIFACTS PASSING INTO THE PAST—

AND THE GRAY SUNFLOWER POISED AGAINST THE SUNSET CRACKLY BLEAK AND DUSTY WITH THE SMUT AND SMOG AND SMOKE OF OLDEN LOCOMOTIVES IN ITS EYE—

COROLLA OF BLEARY SPIKES PUSHED DOWN AND BROKEN LIKE A BATTERED CROWN SEEDS FALLEN OUT OF ITS FACE SOON-TO-BE-TOOTHLESS MOUTH OF SUNNY AIR SUNRAYS OBLITERATED ON ITS HAIRY HEAD LIKE A DRIED WIRE SPIDERWEB

LEAVES STUCK OUT LIKE ARMS OUT OF THE STEM GESTURES FROM THE SAWDUST ROOT BROKE PIECES OF PLASTER FALLEN OUT OF THE BLACK TWIGS A DEAD FLY IN ITS EAR

UNHOLY BATTERED OLD THING YOU WERE MY SUNFLOWER O MY SOUL I LOVED YOU THEN!

THE GRIME WAS NO MAN’S GRIME BUT DEATH AND HUMAN LOCOMOTIVES

ALL THAT DRESS OF DUST THAT VEIL OF DARKENED RAILROAD SKIN THAT SMOG OF CHEEK THAT EYELID OF BLACK MIS’RY THAT SOOTY HAND OR PHALLUS OR PROTUBERANCE OF ARTIFICIAL WORSE-THAN-DIRT—INDUSTRIAL—MODERN—ALL THAT CIVILIZATION SPOTTING YOUR CRAZY GOLDEN CROWN—

AND THOSE BLEAR THOUGHTS OF DEATH AND DUSTY LOVELESS EYES AND ENDS AND WITHERED ROOTS BELOW IN THE HOME-PILE OF SAND AND SAWDUST RUBBER DOLLAR BILLS SKIN OF MACHINERY THE GUTS AND INNARDS OF THE WEEPING COUGHING CAR THE EMPTY LONELY TINCANS WITH THEIR RUSTY TONGUES ALACK WHAT MORE COULD I NAME THE SMOKED ASHES OF SOME COCK CIGAR THE CUNTS OF WHEELBARROWS AND THE MILKY BREASTS OF CARS WORNOUT ASSES OUT OF CHAIRS & SPHINCTERS OF DYNAMOS—ALL THESE

ENTANGLED IN YOUR MUMMIED ROOTS—AND YOU THERE STANDING BEFORE ME IN THE SUNSET ALL YOUR GLORY IN YOUR FORM!

A PERFECT BEAUTY OF A SUNFLOWER! A PERFECT EXCELLENT LOVELY SUNFLOWER EXISTENCE! A SWEET NATURAL EYE TO THE NEW HIP MOON WOKE UP ALIVE AND EXCITED GRASPING IN THE SUNSET SHADOW SUNRISE GOLDEN MONTHLY BREEZE!

HOW MANY FLIES BUZZED ROUND YOU INNOCENT OF YOUR GRIME WHILE YOU CURSED THE HEAVENS OF THE RAILROAD AND YOUR FLOWER SOUL?

POOR DEAD FLOWER? WHEN DID YOU FORGET YOU WERE A FLOWER? WHEN DID YOU LOOK AT YOUR SKIN AND DECIDE YOU WERE AN IMPOTENT DIRTY OLD LOCOMOTIVE? THE GHOST OF A LOCOMOTIVE? THE SPECTER AND SHADE OF A ONCE POWERFUL MAD AMERICAN LOCOMOTIVE?

YOU WERE NEVER NO LOCOMOTIVE SUNFLOWER YOU WERE A SUNFLOWER!

AND YOU LOCOMOTIVE YOU ARE A LOCOMOTIVE FORGET ME NOT!

SO I GRABBED UP THE SKELETON THICK SUNFLOWER AND STUCK IT AT MY SIDE LIKE A SCEPTER

AND DELIVER MY SERMON TO MY SOUL AND JACK’S SOUL TOO AND ANYONE WHO’LL LISTEN

—WE’RE NOT OUR SKIN OF GRIME WE’RE NOT OUR DREAD BLEAK DUSTY IMAGELESS LOCOMOTIVES WE’RE ALL GOLDEN SUNFLOWERS INSIDE BLESSED BY OUR OWN SEED & HAIRY NAKED ACCOMPLISHMENT-BODIES GROWING INTO MAD BLACK FORMAL SUNFLOWERS IN THE SUNSET SPIED ON BY OUR OWN EYES UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MAD LOCOMOTIVE RIVERBANK SUNSET FRISCO HILLY TINCAN EVENING SITDOWN VISION.

AMERICA

AMERICA I’VE GIVEN YOU ALL AND NOW I’M NOTHING.

AMERICA TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTYSEVEN CENTS JANUARY 17 1956.

I CAN’T STAND MY OWN MIND.

AMERICA WHEN WILL WE END THE HUMAN WAR?

GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH YOUR ATOM BOMB.

I DON’T FEEL GOOD DON’T BOTHER ME.

I WON’T WRITE MY POEM TILL I’M IN MY RIGHT MIND.

AMERICA WHEN WILL YOU BE ANGELIC?

WHEN WILL YOU TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES?

WHEN WILL YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF THROUGH THE GRAVE?

WHEN WILL YOU BE WORTHY OF YOUR MILLION TROTSKYITES?

AMERICA WHY ARE YOUR LIBRARIES FULL OF TEARS?

AMERICA WHEN WILL YOU SEND YOUR EGGS TO INDIA?

I’M SICK OF YOUR INSANE DEMANDS.

WHEN CAN I GO INTO THE SUPERMARKET AND BUY WHAT I NEED WITH MY GOOD LOOKS?

AMERICA AFTER ALL IT IS YOU AND I WHO ARE PERFECT NOT THE NEXT WORLD.

YOUR MACHINERY IS TOO MUCH FOR ME.

YOU MADE ME WANT TO BE A SAINT.

THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT.

BURROUGHS IS IN TANGIERS I DON’T THINK HE’LL COME BACK IT’S SINISTER.

ARE YOU BEING SINISTER OR IS THIS SOME FORM OF PRACTICAL JOKE?

I’M TRYING TO COME TO THE POINT.

I REFUSE TO GIVE UP MY OBSESSION.

AMERICA STOP PUSHING I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING.

AMERICA THE PLUM BLOSSOMS ARE FALLING.

I HAVEN’T READ THE NEWSPAPERS FOR MONTHS EVERYDAY SOMEBODY GOES ON TRIAL FOR MURDER.

AMERICA I FEEL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE WOBBLIES.

AMERICA I USED TO BE A COMMUNIST WHEN I WAS A KID I’M NOT SORRY.

I SMOKE MARIJUANA EVERY CHANCE I GET.

I SIT IN MY HOUSE FOR DAYS ON END AND STARE AT THE ROSES IN THE CLOSET.

WHEN I GO TO CHINATOWN I GET DRUNK AND NEVER GET LAID.

MY MIND IS MADE UP THERE’S GOING TO BE TROUBLE.

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME READING MARX.

MY PSYCHOANALYST THINKS I’M PERFECTLY RIGHT.

I WON’T SAY THE LORD’S PRAYER.

I HAVE MYSTICAL VISIONS AND COSMIC VIBRATIONS.

AMERICA I STILL HAVEN’T TOLD YOU WHAT YOU DID TO UNCLE MAX AFTER HE CAME OVER FROM RUSSIA.

I’M ADDRESSING YOU.

ARE YOU GOING TO LET YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE BE RUN BY TIME MAGAZINE?

I’M OBSESSED BY TIME MAGAZINE.

I READ IT EVERY WEEK.

ITS COVER STARES AT ME EVERY TIME I SLINK PAST THE CORNER CANDYSTORE.

I READ IT IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BERKELEY PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IT’S ALWAYS TELLING ME ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. BUSINESSMEN ARE SERIOUS. MOVIE PRODUCERS ARE SERIOUS. EVERYBODY’S SERIOUS BUT ME.

IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I AM AMERICA.

I AM TALKING TO MYSELF AGAIN.

ASIA IS RISING AGAINST ME.

I HAVEN’T GOT A CHINAMAN’S CHANCE.

I’D BETTER CONSIDER MY NATIONAL RESOURCES.

MY NATIONAL RESOURCES CONSIST OF TWO JOINTS OF MARIJUANA MILLIONS OF GENITALS AN UNPUBLISHABLE PRIVATE LITERATURE THAT JETPLANES 1400 MILES AN HOUR AND TWENTY-FIVE-THOUSAND MENTAL INSTITUTIONS.

I SAY NOTHING ABOUT MY PRISONS NOR THE MILLIONS OF UNDERPRIVILEGED WHO LIVE IN MY FLOWERPOTS UNDER THE LIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED SUNS.

I HAVE ABOLISHED THE WHOREHOUSES OF FRANCE TANGIERS IS THE NEXT TO GO.

MY AMBITION IS TO BE PRESIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT I’M A CATHOLIC.

AMERICA HOW CAN I WRITE A HOLY LITANY IN YOUR SILLY MOOD?

I WILL CONTINUE LIKE HENRY FORD MY STROPHES ARE AS INDIVIDUAL AS HIS AUTOMOBILES MORE SO THEY’RE ALL DIFFERENT SEXES.

AMERICA I WILL SELL YOU STROPHES $2500 APIECE $500 DOWN ON YOUR OLD STROPHE

AMERICA FREE TOM MOONEY

AMERICA SAVE THE SPANISH LOYALISTS

AMERICA SACCO & VANZETTI MUST NOT DIE

AMERICA I AM THE SCOTTSBORO BOYS.

AMERICA WHEN I WAS SEVEN MOMMA TOOK ME TO COMMUNIST CELL MEETINGS THEY SOLD US GARBANZOS A HANDFUL PER TICKET A TICKET COSTS A NICKEL AND THE SPEECHES WERE FREE EVERYBODY WAS ANGELIC AND SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE WORKERS IT WAS ALL SO SINCERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A GOOD THING THE PARTY WAS IN 1835 SCOTT NEARING WAS A GRAND OLD MAN A REAL MENSCH MOTHER BLOOR THE SILK-STRIKERS’ EWIG-WEIBLICHE MADE ME CRY I ONCE SAW THE YIDDISH ORATOR ISREAL AMTER PLAIN. EVERYBODY MUST HAVE BEEN A SPY.

AMERICA YOU DON’T REALLY WANT TO GO TO WAR.

AMERICA IT’S THEM BAD RUSSIANS.

THEM RUSSIANS THEM RUSSIANS AND THEM CHINAMEN. AND THEM RUSSIANS.

THE RUSSIA WANTS TO EAT US ALIVE. THE RUSSIA’S POWER MAD. SHE WANTS TO TAKE OUR CARS FROM OUT OUR GARAGES.

HER WANTS TO GRAB CHICAGO. HER NEEDS A RED READER’S DIGEST. HER WANTS OUR AUTO PLANTS IN SIBERIA. HIM BIG BUREAUCRACY RUNNING OUR FILLINGSTATIONS.

THAT NO GOOD. UGH. HIM MAKE INDIANS LEARN READ. HIM NEED BIG BLACK NIGGERS. HAH. HER MAKE US ALL WORK SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY. HELP.

AMERICA THIS IS QUITE SERIOUS.

AMERICA THIS IS THE IMPRESSION I GET FROM LOOKING IN THE TELEVISION SET.

AMERICA IS THIS CORRECT?

I’D BETTER GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE JOB.

IT’S TRUE I DON’T WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY OR TURN LATHES IN PRECISION PARTS FACTORIES I’M NEARSIGHTED AND PSYCHOPATHIC ANYWAY.

AMERICA I’M PUTTING MY QUEER SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL.

KADDISH

FOR NAOMI GINSBERG 1894–1956

I

STRANGE NOW TO THINK OF YOU GONE WITHOUT CORSETS & EYES WHILE I WALK ON THE SUNNY PAVEMENT OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.

DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN CLEAR WINTER NOON AND I’VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT TALKING TALKING READING THE KADDISH ALOUD LISTENING TO RAY CHARLES BLUES SHOUT BLIND ON THE PHONOGRAPH

THE RHYTHM THE RHYTHM—AND YOUR MEMORY IN MY HEAD THREE YEARS AFTER—AND READ ADONAIS’ LAST TRIUMPHANT STANZAS ALOUD—WEPT REALIZING HOW WE SUFFER—

DREAMING BACK THRU LIFE YOUR TIME—AND MINE ACCELERATING TOWARD APOCALYPSE

THE FINAL MOMENT—THE FLOWER BURNING IN THE DAY—AND WHAT COMES AFTER

LOOKING BACK ON THE MIND ITSELF THAT SAW AN AMERICAN CITY

A FLASH AWAY AND THE GREAT DREAM OF ME OR CHINA OR YOU AND A PHANTOM RUSSIA OR A CRUMPLED BED THAT NEVER EXISTED—

LIKE A POEM IN THE DARK—ESCAPED BACK TO OBLIVION—

NO MORE TO SAY AND NOTHING TO WEEP FOR BUT THE BEINGS IN THE DREAM TRAPPED IN ITS DISAPPEARANCE

SIGHING SCREAMING WITH IT BUYING AND SELLING PIECES OF PHANTOM WORSHIPPING EACH OTHER

WORSHIPPING THE GOD INCLUDED IN IT ALL—LONGING OR INEVITABILITY?—WHILE IT LASTS A VISION—ANYTHING MORE?

IT LEAPS ABOUT ME AS I GO OUT AND WALK THE STREET LOOK BACK OVER MY SHOULDER SEVENTH AVENUE THE BATTLEMENTS OF WINDOW OFFICE BUILDINGS SHOULDERING EACH OTHER HIGH UNDER A CLOUD TALL AS THE SKY AN INSTANT—AND THE SKY ABOVE—AN OLD BLUE PLACE.

OR DOWN THE AVENUE TO THE SOUTH TO—AS I WALK TOWARD THE LOWER EAST SIDE—WHERE YOU WALKED 50 YEARS AGO LITTLE GIRL—FROM RUSSIA EATING THE FIRST POISONOUS TOMATOES OF AMERICA—FRIGHTENED ON THE DOCK—

THEN STRUGGLING IN THE CROWDS OF ORCHARD STREET TOWARD WHAT?—TOWARD NEWARK—

TOWARD CANDY STORE FIRST HOME-MADE SODAS OF THE CENTURY HAND-CHURNED ICE CREAM IN BACKROOM ON MUSTY BROWNFLOOR BOARDS—

TOWARD EDUCATION MARRIAGE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN OPERATION TEACHING SCHOOL AND LEARNING TO BE MAD IN A DREAM—WHAT IS THIS LIFE?

TOWARD THE KEY IN THE WINDOW—AND THE GREAT KEY LAYS ITS HEAD OF LIGHT ON TOP OF MANHATTAN AND OVER THE FLOOR AND LAYS DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK—IN A SINGLE VAST BEAM MOVING AS I WALK DOWN FIRST TOWARD THE YIDDISH THEATER—AND THE PLACE OF POVERTY

YOU KNEW AND I KNOW BUT WITHOUT CARING NOW—STRANGE TO HAVE MOVED THRU PATERSON AND THE WEST AND EUROPE AND HERE AGAIN

WITH THE CRIES OF SPANIARDS NOW IN THE DOORSTOOPS DOORS AND DARK BOYS ON THE STREET FIRE ESCAPES OLD AS YOU

—THO YOU’RE NOT OLD NOW THAT’S LEFT HERE WITH ME—

MYSELF ANYHOW MAYBE AS OLD AS THE UNIVERSE—AND I GUESS THAT DIES WITH US—ENOUGH TO CANCEL ALL THAT COMES—WHAT CAME IS GONE FOREVER EVERY TIME—

THAT’S GOOD! THAT LEAVES IT OPEN FOR NO REGRET—NO FEAR RADIATORS LACKLOVE TORTURE EVEN TOOTHACHE IN THE END—

THOUGH WHILE IT COMES IT IS A LION THAT EATS THE SOUL—AND THE LAMB THE SOUL IN US ALAS OFFERING ITSELF IN SACRIFICE TO CHANGE’S FIERCE HUNGER—HAIR AND TEETH—AND THE ROAR OF BONEPAIN SKULL BARE BREAK RIB ROT-SKIN BRAINTRICKED IMPLACABILITY.

NO MORE FLOWERS IN THE SUMMER FIELDS OF NEW YORK NO JOY NOW NO MORE FEAR OF LOUIS

AND NO MORE OF HIS SWEETNESS AND GLASSES HIS HIGH SCHOOL DECADES DEBTS LOVES FRIGHTENED TELEPHONE CALLS CONCEPTION BEDS RELATIVES HANDS—

NO MORE OF SISTER ELANOR—SHE GONE BEFORE YOU—WE KEPT IT SECRET—YOU KILLED HER—OR SHE KILLED HERSELF TO BEAR WITH YOU—AN ARTHRITIC HEART—BUT DEATH’S KILLED YOU BOTH—NO MATTER—

NOR YOUR MEMORY OF YOUR MOTHER 1915 TEARS IN SILENT MOVIES WEEKS AND WEEKS—FORGETTING AGGRIEVE WATCHING MARIE DRESSLER ADDRESS HUMANITY CHAPLIN DANCE IN YOUTH

OR BORIS GODUNOV CHALIAPIN’S AT THE MET HALLING HIS VOICE OF A WEEPING CZAR—BY STANDING ROOM WITH ELANOR & MAX—WATCHING ALSO THE CAPITALISTS TAKE SEATS IN ORCHESTRA WHITE FURS DIAMONDS

I DIDN’T FORESEE WHAT YOU FELT—WHAT MORE HIDEOUS GAPE OF BAD MOUTH CAME FIRST—TO YOU—AND WERE YOU PREPARED?

TO GO WHERE? IN THAT DARK—THAT—IN THAT GOD? A RADIANCE? A LORD IN THE VOID? LIKE AN EYE IN THE BLACK CLOUD IN A DREAM? ADONOI AT LAST WITH YOU?

BEYOND MY REMEMBRANCE! INCAPABLE TO GUESS! NOT MERELY THE YELLOW SKULL IN THE GRAVE OR A BOX OF WORM DUST AND A STAINED RIBBON—DEATHS-HEAD WITH HALO? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

IS IT ONLY THE SUN THAT SHINES ONCE FOR THE MIND ONLY THE FLASH OF EXISTENCE THAN NONE EVER WAS?

NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE—WHAT YOU HAD—THAT SO PITIFUL—YET TRIUMPH

TO HAVE BEEN HERE AND CHANGED LIKE A TREE BROKEN OR FLOWER—FED TO THE GROUND—BUT MAD WITH ITS PETALS COLORED THINKING GREAT UNIVERSE SHAKEN CUT IN THE HEAD LEAF STRIPT HID IN AN EGG CRATE HOSPITAL CLOTH WRAPPED SORE—FREAKED IN THE MOON BRAIN NAUGHTLESS.

NO FLOWER LIKE THAT FLOWER WHICH KNEW ITSELF IN THE GARDEN AND FOUGHT THE KNIFE—LOST

CUT DOWN BY AN IDIOT SNOWMAN’S ICY—EVEN IN THE SPRING—STRANGE GHOST THOUGHT—SOME DEATH—SHARP ICICLE IN HIS HAND—CROWNED WITH OLD ROSES—A DOG FOR HIS EYES—COCK OF A SWEATSHOP—HEART OF ELECTRIC IRONS.

ALL THE ACCUMULATIONS OF LIFE THAT WEAR US OUT—CLOCKS BODIES CONSCIOUSNESS SHOES BREASTS—BEGOTTEN SONS—YOUR COMMUNISM—‘PARANOIA’ INTO HOSPITALS.

YOU ONCE KICKED ELANOR IN THE LEG SHE DIED OF HEART FAILURE LATER. YOU OF STROKE. ASLEEP? WITHIN A YEAR THE TWO OF YOU SISTERS IN DEATH. IS ELANOR HAPPY?

I’LL SEE HIM SOON. NOW I’VE GOT TO CUT THROUGH—TO TALK TO YOU—AS I DIDN’T WHEN YOU HAD A MOUTH.

FOREVER. AND WE’RE BOUND FOR THAT FOREVER—LIKE EMILY DICKINSON’S HORSES—HEADED TO THE END.

THEY KNOW THE WAY—THESE STEEDS—RUN FASTER THAN WE THINK—IT’S OUR OWN LIFE THEY CROSS—AND TAKE WITH THEM.

MAGNIFICENT MOURNED NO MORE MARRED OF HEART MIND BEHIND MARRIED DREAMED MORTAL CHANGED—ASS AND FACE DONE WITH MURDER.

BY THAT AFTERNOON I STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO TAKE CARE OF YOU—ONCE AND FOR ALL—WHEN I VOWED FOREVER THAT ONCE MAN DISAGREED WITH MY OPINION OF THE COSMOS I WAS LOST—

BY MY LATER BURDEN—VOW TO ILLUMINATE MANKIND—THIS IS RELEASE OF PARTICULARS—(MAD AS YOU)—(SANITY A TRICK OF AGREEMENT)—

BUT YOU STARED OUT THE WINDOW ON THE BROADWAY CHURCH CORNER AND SPIED A MYSTICAL ASSASSIN FROM NEWARK

SO PHONED THE DOCTOR—‘OK GO WAY FOR A REST’—SO I PUT ON MY COAT AND WALKED YOU DOWNSTREET—ON THE WAY A GRAMMARSCHOOL BOY SCREAMED UNACCOUNTABLY—‘WHERE YOU GOIN LADY TO DEATH’? I SHUDDERED—

AND YOU COVERED YOUR NOSE WITH MOTHEATEN FUR COLLAR GAS MASK AGAINST POISON SNEAKED INTO DOWNTOWN ATMOSPHERE SPRAYED BY GRANDMA—

AND WAS THE DRIVER OF THE CHEESEBOX PUBLIC SERVICE BUS A MEMBER OF THE GANG? YOU SHUDDERED AT HIS FACE I COULD HARDLY GET YOU ON—TO NEW YORK VERY TIMES SQUARE TO GRAB ANOTHER GREYHOUND—

WHERE WE HUNG AROUND 2 HOURS FIGHTING INVISIBLE BUGS AND JEWISH SICKNESS—BREEZE POISONED BY ROOSEVELT—

PERHAPS A HAWK IN A TREE OR A HERMIT LOOKING FOR AN OWL-FILLED BRANCH—

ALL THE TIME ARGUING—AFRAID OF STRANGERS IN THE FORWARD DOUBLE SEAT SNORING REGARDLESS—WHAT BUSRIDE THEY SNORE ON NOW?

‘ALLEN YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND—IT’S—EVER SINCE THOSE 3 BIG STICKS UP MY BACK—THEY DID SOMETHING TO ME IN HOSPITAL THEY POISONED ME THEY WANT TO SEE ME DEAD—3 BIG STICKS 3 BIG STICKS—

STORM WARNINGS

THE GLASS HAS BEEN FALLING ALL THE AFTERNOON

AND KNOWING BETTER THAN THE INSTRUMENT

WHAT WINDS ARE WALKING OVERHEAD WHAT ZONE

OF GRAY UNREST IS MOVING ACROSS THE LAND

I LEAVE THE BOOK UPON A PILLOWED CHAIR

AND WALK FROM WINDOW TO CLOSED WINDOW WATCHING

BOUGHS STRAIN AGAINST THE SKY

AND THINK AGAIN AS OFTEN WHEN THE AIR

MOVES INWARD TOWARD A SILENT CORE OF WAITING

HOW WITH A SINGLE PURPOSE TIME HAS TRAVELED

BY SECRET CURRENTS OF THE UNDISCERNED

INTO THIS POLAR REALM. WEATHER ABROAD

AND WEATHER IN THE HEART ALIKE COME ON

REGARDLESS OF PREDICTION.

BETWEEN FORESEEING AND AVERTING CHANGE

LIES ALL THE MASTERY OF ELEMENTS

WHICH CLOCKS AND WEATHERGLASSES CANNOT ALTER.

TIME IN THE HAND IS NOT CONTROL OF TIME

NOR SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF AN INSTRUMENT

A PROOF AGAINST THE WIND; THE WIND WILL RISE

WE CAN ONLY CLOSE THE SHUTTERS.

I DRAW THE CURTAINS AS THE SKY GOES BLACK

AND SET A MATCH TO CANDLES SHEATHED IN GLASS

AGAINST THE KEYHOLE DRAUGHT THE INSISTENT WHINE

OF WEATHER THROUGH THE UNSEALED APERTURE.

THIS IS OUR SOLE DEFENSE AGAINST THE SEASON;

THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO DO

WHO LIVE IN TROUBLED REGIONS.

AUNT JENNIFER’S TIGERS

AUNT JENNIFER’S TIGERS PRANCE ACROSS A SCREEN

BRIGHT TOPAZ DENIZENS OF A WORLD OF GREEN.

THEY DO NOT FEAR THE MEN BENEATH THE TREE;

THEY PACE IN SLEEK CHIVALRIC CERTAINTY.

AUNT JENNIFER’S FINGERS FLUTTERING THROUGH HER WOOL

FIND EVEN THE IVORY NEEDLE HARD TO PULL.

THE MASSIVE WEIGHT OF UNCLE’S WEDDING BAND

SITS HEAVILY UPON AUNT JENNIFER’S HAND.

WHEN AUNT IS DEAD HER TERRIFIED HANDS WILL LIE

STILL RINGED WITH ORDEALS SHE WAS MASTERED BY.

THE TIGERS IN THE PANEL THAT SHE MADE

WILL GO ON PRANCING PROUD AND UNAFRAID.

VERTIGO

AS FOR ME I DISTRUST THE COMMONPLACE;

DEMAND AND AM RECEIVING MARVELS SIGNS

MIRACLES WROUGHT IN AIR ACTED IN SPACE

AFTER IMAGINATION’S OWN DESIGNS.

THE LION AND THE TIGER PACE THIS WAY

AS OFTEN AS I CALL; THE FLIGHT OF WINGS

SURPRISES EMPTY AIR WHILE OUT OF CLAY

THE GOLDEN-GOURDED VINE UNWATERED SPRINGS.

I HAVE INHALED IMPOSSIBILITY

AND WALK AT SUCH AN ANGLE ALL THE STARS

HAVE HUNG THEIR CARNIVAL CHAINS OF LIGHT FOR ME:

THERE IS A STREETCAR RUNS FROM HERE TO MARS.

I SHALL BE SEEING YOU MY DARLING THERE

OR AT THE BURNING BUSH IN HARVARD SQUARE.

WHAT IF THE WORLD’S CORRUPTION NEARS

THE CONSEQUENCE THEY DARE NOT NAME?

WE SHALL BUT REALIZE OUR FEARS

AND HAVING TASTED THEM GO ON

NEITHER FROM HOPE OF GRACE NOR FAME

DELIVERED FROM REMORSE AND SHAME

AND DO THE THINGS LEFT TO BE DONE

FOR NO SAKE OTHER THAN THEIR OWN.

THE QUARRY SHALL BE STALKED AND WON

THE BED INVADED AND THE GAME

PLAYED TILL THE ROOF COMES TUMBLING DOWN

AND WIN OR LOSE ARE ALL THE SAME.

ACTION AT SUCH A PITCH SHALL FLAME

ONLY BENEATH A FINAL SUN.

WHAT GHOSTS CAN SAY

WHEN HARRY WYLIE SAW HIS FATHER’S GHOST

AS BEARDED AND IMMENSE AS ONCE IN LIFE

BENDING ABOVE HIS BED LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT

HE SCREAMED AND GRIPPED THE CORNER OF THE PILLOW

TILL AUNTS CAME HURRYING WHITE IN DRESSING GOWNS

TO SAY IT WAS A DREAM. HE KNEW THEY LIED.

THE SMELL OF HIS FATHER’S LEATHER RIDING CROP

AND STALE TOBACCO STAYED TO PROVE IT TO HIM.

WHY SHOULD THERE STAY SUCH TOKENS OF A GHOST

IF NOT TO PROVE IT CAME ON SERIOUS BUSINESS?

HIS FATHER ALWAYS HAD MEANT SERIOUS BUSINESS

BUT NEVER SO WHOLLY IN HIS LOOK AND GESTURE

AS WHEN HE BEAT THE BOY’S UNCOVERED THIGHS

CALMLY AND RESOLUTELY AT AN HOUR

WHEN HARRY NEVER HAD BEEN AWAKE BEFORE.

THE MAN WHO COULD CHOOSE THAT SINGLE HOUR OF NIGHT

HAD IN HIM THE INGREDIENTS OF A GHOST;

MORTALITY WOULD QUAIL AT SUCH A MAN.

AN OLDER HARRY LOST HIS CHILDISH NOTION

AND ONLY SOMETIMES WONDERED IF EVENTS

COULD ECHO THUS LONG AFTER IN A DREAM.

IF SO IT SURELY MEANT THEY HAD A MEANING.

BUT WHY THE ACTUAL PUNISHMENT HAD FALLEN

FOR WHAT OFFENSE OF BOYHOOD HE COULD TRY

FOR YEARS AND NOT UNEARTH. WHAT GHOSTS CAN SAY—

EVEN THE GHOSTS OF FATHERS—COMES OBSCURELY.

WHAT IF THE TERROR STAYS WITHOUT THE MEANING?

THE KURSAAL AT INTERLAKEN

HERE AMONG TABLES LIT WITH BOTTLED TAPERS

THE VIOLINS ARE TUNING FOR THE EVENING

AGAINST THE MEASURED “FAITES VOS JEUX” THE MURMUR

RISING AND FALLING FROM THE GAMING ROOMS.

THE WAITERS SKIM BENEATH THE ORNATE RAFTERS

WHERE LANTERNS SWING LIKE TISSUE-PAPER BUBBLES.

THE TABLES FILL THE BOTTLED CANDLES DRIP

THE GAMING WHEELS SPIN IN THE LONG SALON

AND OPERETTA WALTZES GILD THE AIR

WITH THE CAPRICIOUS LILT OF COSTUME MUSIC.

YOU WILL PERHAPS MAKE LOVE TO ME THIS EVENING

DANCING AMONG THE CIRCULAR GREEN TABLES

OR WHERE THE CLOCKWORK TINKLE OF THE FOUNTAIN

SOUNDS IN THE GARDEN’S PRIMLY PEBBLED ARBORS.

REALITY IS NO STRONGER THAN A WALTZ

A PAINTED LAKE STIPPLED WITH BOATS AND SWANS

A GLASS OF GOLD-BROWN BEER A PHRASE IN GERMAN

OR FRENCH OR ANY LANGUAGE BUT OUR OWN.

REALITY WOULD CALL US LESS THAN FRIENDS

AND THEREFORE MORE ADEPT AT MAKING LOVE.

WHAT IS THE WORLD THE VIOLINS SEEM TO SAY

BUT WINDOWS FULL OF BEARS AND MUSIC BOXES

CHOCOLATE GNOMES AND WATER-COLOR MOUNTAINS

AND CALENDARS OF FRENCH AND GERMAN DAYS—

SONNTAG AND VENDREDI UNREAL DIMENSIONS

DAYS WHERE WE SPEAK ALL LANGUAGES BUT OUR OWN?

SO IN THIS EVENING OF A MYTHICAL SUMMER

WE SHALL BELIEVE ALL FLOWERS ARE EDELWEISS

ALL BEARS HAND-CARVED ALL KISSES OUT OF TIME

CAUGHT IN THE SPINNING VERTIGO OF A WALTZ.

THE FRINGE OF FOAM CLINGS LACELIKE TO YOUR GLASS

AND NOW THAT MIDNIGHT DRAWS WITH SWISS PERFECTION

THE CLOCK’S TWO HANDS INTO A SINGLE GESTURE

SHALL WE PURSUE THIS MOOD INTO THE NIGHT

PLAY THIS CHARADE OUT IN THE SILVER STREET

WHERE MOONLIGHT POURS A THEME BY BERLIOZ?

IF FAR FROM BREATH OF OURS INDIFFERENT FROZEN

THE MOUNTAIN LIKE A SWORD AGAINST THE NIGHT

CATCHES A COLDER SILVER DRAWS OUR SIGHT

WHAT IS SHE BUT A LOCAL TOUR DE FORCE?

THE AIR IS BRIGHT WITH AFTER-IMAGES.

THE LANTERNS AND THE TWINKLING GLASSES DWINDLE

THE WALTZES AND THE CROUPIERS’ VOICES CRUMBLE

THE EVENING FOLDS LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE.

AGAINST THE SPLINTERS OF A REELING LANDSCAPE

THIS IMAGE STILL PURSUES US INTO TIME:

JUNGFRAU THE LEGENDARY VIRGIN SPIRE

CONSUMES THE MIND WITH MINGLED SNOW AND FIRE.

RELIQUARY

THE BONES OF SAINTS ARE PRAISED ABOVE THEIR FLESH

THAT PALE REJECTED GARMENT OF THEIR LIVES

IN WHICH THEY WALKED DESPISED UNCANONIZED.

BROODING UPON THE MARBLE BONES OF TIME

MEN READ STRANGE SANCTITY IN LOST EVENTS

HOLD REQUIEM MASS FOR MURDERED YESTERDAYS

AND IN THE DUST OF ACTIONS ONCE REVILED

FIND SYMBOLS TRACED AND FREEZE THEM INTO STONE.

PURELY LOCAL

BESIDE THIS DOOR A JANUARY TREE

ANSWERS A FEW DAYS’ WARMTH WITH SHOOTS OF GREEN;

AND KNOWING WHAT THE WINDS MUST DO I SEE

A HINT OF SOMETHING HUMAN IN THE SCENE.

NO MATTER HOW THE ALMANACS HAVE SAID

HOLD BACK DISTRUST A PURELY LOCAL MAY

WHEN DID WE EVER LEARN TO BE AFRAID?

WHY ARE WE SCARRED WITH WINTER’S THRUST TODAY?

A VIEW OF THE TERRACE

UNDER THE GREEN UMBRELLAS

DRINKING GOLDEN TEA

THERE SIT THE PORCELAIN PEOPLE

WHO CARE FOR YOU BUT LITTLE

AND NOT AT ALL FOR ME.

THE AFTERNOON IN CRINKLES

LIES STIFFLY ON THE LAWN

AND WE TWO FURTIVE EXILES

WATCH FROM AN UPPER WINDOW

WITH SHUTTERS NOT QUITE DRAWN.

THE GILT AND SCALLOPED LAUGHTER

REACHES US THROUGH A GLAZE

AND ALMOST WE IMAGINE

THAT IF WE THREW A PEBBLE

THE SHINING SCENE WOULD CRAZE.

BUT STONES ARE THROWN BY CHILDREN

AND WE BY NOW TOO WISE

TO TRY AGAIN TO SPLINTER

THE BRIGHT ENAMEL PEOPLE

IMPERVIOUS TO SURPRISE.

BY NO MEANS NATIVE

“YONDER” THEY TOLD HIM “THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME.”

HE FOUND IT UNDERSTATED WHEN HE CAME.

HIS TONGUE IN HOPES TO FIND ITSELF AT HOME

CAUGHT UP THE TWIST OF EVERY IDIOM.

HE LEARNED THE ACCENT AND THE TURN OF PHRASE

STUDIED LIKE LATIN TEXTS THE LOCAL WAYS.

HE TASTED TILL HIS PALATE KNEW THEIR SHAPE

THE COUNTRY’S PROUDEST BEAN ITS MASTER GRAPE.

HE NEVER TALKED OF FIELDS REMEMBERED GREEN

OR SEASONS IN HIS LAND OF ORIGIN.

AND STILL HE FELT THERE LAY A BRIDGELESS SPACE

BETWEEN HIMSELF AND NATIVES OF THE PLACE.

THEIR LAUGHTER CAME WHEN HIS HAD LONG ABATED;

HE STRUGGLED IN ALLUSIONS NEVER STATED.

THE TRUTH AT LAST CRIED OUT TO BE CONFESSED:

HE MUST REMAIN ETERNALLY A GUEST

NEVER TO WEAR THE BIRTHMARK OF THEIR WAYS.

HE COULD BE STUDYING NATIVE ALL HIS DAYS

AND DIE A KIND OF MINOR ALIEN STILL.

HE MIGHT DECEIVE HIMSELF BY FORCE OF WILL

FEEL ALL THE SENTIMENTS AND GIVE THE SIGN

YET NEVER OVERSTEP THAT TENUOUS LINE.

WHAT ELSE THEN? WEAR THE OLD IDENTITY

THE MARK OF OTHER BIRTH AND WHEN YOU DIE

DIE AS AN EXILE? IT HAS DONE FOR SOME.

OTHERS SURRENDER BOOK THEIR PASSAGE HOME

ONLY TO SEEK THEIR EXILE SOON AGAIN

NO GREATER STRANGERS THAN THEIR COUNTRYMEN.

YET MAN WILL HAVE HIS BONDAGE TO SOME PLACE;

IF NOT HE SEEKS AN ORDER OR A RACE.

SOME JOIN THE MASONS SOME EMBRACE THE CHURCH

AND IF THEY DO IT DOES NOT MATTER MUCH.

AS FOR HIMSELF HE JOINED THE BAND OF THOSE

WHO PICK THEIR FRUIT NO MATTER WHERE IT GROWS

AND LEARN TO LIKE IT SWEET OR LIKE IT SOUR

DEPENDING ON THE ORCHARD OR THE HOUR.

BY NO MEANS NATIVE YET SOMEWHAT IN LOVE

WITH THINGS A NATIVE IS ENAMORED OF—

EXCEPT THE SENSE OF BEING HELD AND OWNED

BY ONE ANCESTRAL PATCH OF LOCAL GROUND.

AIR WITHOUT INCENSE

WE EAT THIS BODY AND REMAIN OURSELVES.

WE DRINK THIS LIQUOR TASTING WINE NOT BLOOD.

AMONG THESE TRIPLE ICONS RITES OF SEVEN

WE KNOW THE FEAST TO BE OF EARTH NOT HEAVEN:

HERE MAN IS WOUNDED YET WE SPEAK OF GOD.

MORE THAN THE NAZARENE WITH HIM WAS LAID

INTO THE TOMB AND IN THE TOMB HAS STAYED.

COMMUNION OF NO SAINTS MASS WITHOUT BELL

AIR WITHOUT INCENSE WE IMPLORE AT NEED.

THERE ARE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED AND THE SKY

ANSWERS NO QUESTIONS HEARS NO LITANY.

WE BREATHE THE VAPORS OF A SICKENED CREED.

OURS ARE ASSASSINS DEADLIER THAN SIN;

DEEPER DISORDERS STARVE THE SOUL WITHIN.

IF ANY WRIT COULD TELL US WE WOULD READ.

IF ANY GHOST DARED LAY ON US A CLAIM

OUR FIBERS WOULD RESPOND OUR NERVES OBEY;

BUT REVELATION MOVES APART TODAY

FROM GESTURES OF A TIRED PONTIFICAL GAME.

WE SEEK WHERE LAMP AND KYRIE EXPIRE

A SITE UNSCOURGED BY WASTING TONGUES OF FIRE.

FOR THE FELLING OF AN ELM IN THE HARVARD YARD

THEY SAY THE GROUND PRECISELY SWEPT

NO LONGER FEEDS WITH RICH DECAY

THE ROOTS ENORMOUS IN THEIR AGE

THAT LONG AND DEEP BENEATH HAVE SLEPT.

SO THE GREAT SPIRE IS OVERTHROWN

AND SHARP SAWS HAVE GONE HURTLING THROUGH

THE RINGS THAT THREE SLOW CENTURIES WORE;

THE SECOND OLDEST ELM IS DOWN.

THE SHADE WHERE JAMES AND WHITEHEAD STROLLED

BECOMES A LITTER ON THE GREEN.

THE YOUNG MEN PAUSE ALONG THE PATHS

TO SEE THE AXES GLINTING BOLD.

WATCHING THE HEWN TRUNK DRAGGED AWAY

SOME TURN THE SYMBOL TO THEIR OWN

AND SOME ADMIRE THE CLEAN DISPATCH

WITH WHICH THE AGED ELM CAME DOWN.

A CLOCK IN THE SQUARE

THIS HANDLESS CLOCK STARES BLINDLY FROM ITS TOWER

REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY HOUR.

BUT WHAT CAN ONE CLOCK DO TO STOP THE GAME

WHEN OTHERS GO ON STRIKING JUST THE SAME?

WHATEVER MITE OF TRUTH THE GESTURE HELD

TIME MAY BE SILENCED BUT WILL NOT BE STILLED

NOR WE ABSOLVED BY ANY ONE’S WITHDRAWING

FROM ALL THE RESTLESS WAYS WE MUST BE GOING

AND ALL THE RINGS IN WHICH WE’RE SPUN AND SWIRLED

WHETHER AROUND A CLOCKFACE OR A WORLD.

WHY ELSE BUT TO FORESTALL THIS HOUR

WHY ELSE BUT TO FORESTALL THIS HOUR I STAYED

OUT OF THE NOONDAY SUN KEPT FROM THE RAIN

SWAM ONLY IN FAMILIAR DEPTHS AND PLAYED

NO HAND WHERE CAUTION SIGNALED TO REFRAIN?

FOR FOURTEEN FRIENDS I WALKED BEHIND THE BIER;

A SCORE OF COUSINS WILTED IN MY SIGHT.

I HEARD THE STEEPLES CLANG FOR EACH NEW YEAR

THEN DREW MY SHUTTERS CLOSE AGAINST THE NIGHT.

BANKRUPTCY FELL ON OTHERS LIKE A DEW;

SPENDTHRIFTS OF LIFE THEY ALL SUCCUMBED AND FLED.

I DID NOT CHIDE THEM WITH THE THINGS I KNEW:

SMILING I PASSED THE ALMSHOUSE OF THE DEAD.

I AM THE MAN WHO HAS OUTMISERED DEATH

IN PAINS AND CUNNING LAID MY SEASONS BY.

NOW I MUST TOIL TO WIN EACH HOUR AND BREATH;

I AM TOO FULL OF YEARS TO REASON WHY.

THIS BEAST THIS ANGEL

NO: THIS MY LOVE IS NEITHER YOU NOR I.

THIS IS THE BEAST OR ANGEL CHANGING FORM

THE WILL THAT WE ARE SCOURGED AND NOURISHED BY.

THE GOLDEN FANGS THE TALL SERAPHIC SWORD

ALIKE UNSHEATHED AWAIT THE MIDNIGHT CRY

BLAZON THEIR ANSWER TO THE STAMMERED WORD.

BENEATH THIS GAZE OUR POWERS ARE FUSED AS ONE;

WE MEET THESE EYES UNDER THE CURVE OF NIGHT.

THIS IS THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IS DONE

WHERE MORTAL FORCES SLAY MORTALITY

AND TOWERING AT TERRIBLE FULL HEIGHT

THIS BEAST THIS ANGEL IS BOTH YOU AND I.

EASTPORT TO BLOCK ISLAND

ALONG THE COASTAL WATERS SIGNALS RUN

IN WAVES OF CAUTION AND ANXIETY.

WE’LL TRY THE CATBOAT OUT ANOTHER DAY.

SO DANNY STANDS IN SEA-GRASS BY THE PORCH

TO WATCH A HEELING DINGHY LONE ON GREY

GRAPPLE WITH MOODS OF WIND THAT TAKE THE BAY.

ONE YEAR WE WALKED AMONG THE SHIPWRECKED SHINGLES

OF STORM-CRAZED COTTAGES ALONG THE DUNE.

ROSA MORELLI FOUND HER HUSBAND’S BOAT

RUINED ON THE ROCKS; SHE NEVER SAW HIM DEAD

AND AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF STUBBORN HOPE

BEGAN TO CURSE THE SIGHT OF THINGS AFLOAT.

THE MOTHER OF THE KENNEDY BOYS IS OUT

STRIPPING THE MONDAY BURDEN FROM THE LINE

AND LOOKING FOR A ROWBOAT ROUND THE HEADLAND.

WONDER IF THEY STOPPED FOR BAIT AT MORY’S

AND IF THE OLD MAN MADE THEM UNDERSTAND

THIS IS A DAY FOR BOYS TO STAY ON LAND?

SMALL CRAFT SMALL CRAFT STAY IN AND WAIT FOR TIDINGS.

THE WORD COMES IN WITH EVERY HOUR OF WIND.

NEWS OF A LOCAL VIOLENCE PRICKS THE AIR

AND WE WHO HAVE SEEN THE KITCHEN BLOWN AWAY

OR HARPER’S CHILDREN WASHED FROM SIGHT PREPARE

AS USUAL IN THESE PARTS FOR FOUL NOT FAIR.

AT A DEATHBED IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

I BID YOU CAST OUT PITY.

NO MORE OF THAT: LET BE

IMPOTENT GRIEF AND MOURNING.

HOW SHALL A MAN BREAK FREE

FROM THIS DEATHWATCH OF EARTH

THIS WORLD ESTRANGED FROM MIRTH?

SHOW ME GAY FACES ONLY.

I CALL FOR PRIDE AND WIT—

MEN WHO REMEMBER LAUGHTER

BRAVE JESTERS TO BEFIT

AN AGE THAT WOULD DESTROY

ITS LAST OUTPOST OF JOY.

NO LONGER CONDOLENCE

AND WAILING ON THE TONGUE.

AN OLD MAN BIDS YOU LAUGH;

THIS TEXT I LEAVE THE YOUNG:

YOUR RAGE AND LOUD DESPAIR

BUT SHAKE A CRUMBLING STAIR.

LAUGHTER IS WHAT MEN LEARN

AT SEVENTY YEARS OR MORE

WEARY OF BEING STERN

OR VIOLENT AS BEFORE.

LAUGHTER TO US IS LEFT

TO LIGHT THAT DARKENING RIFT

WHERE LITTLE TIME IS WITH US

LET US ENACT AGAIN

NOT OEDIPUS BUT THE CLOUDS.

SUMMON THE PLAYERS IN.

BE PROUD ON A SORRY EARTH:

BRING ON THE MEN OF MIRTH.

AFTERWARD

NOW THAT YOUR HOPES ARE SHAMED YOU STAND

AT LAST BELIEVING AND RESIGNED

AND NONE OF US WHO TOUCH YOUR HAND

KNOW HOW TO GIVE YOU BACK IN KIND

THE WORDS YOU FLUNG WHEN HOPES WERE PROUD:

BEING BORN TO HAPPINESS

ABOVE THE ASKING OF THE CROWD

YOU WOULD NOT TAKE A FINGER LESS.

WE WHO KNOW LIMITS NOW GIVE ROOM

TO ONE WHO GROWS TO FIT HER DOOM.

THE UNCLE SPEAKS IN THE DRAWING ROOM

I HAVE SEEN THE MOB OF LATE

STANDING SULLEN IN THE SQUARE

GAZING WITH A SULLEN STARE

AT WINDOW BALCONY AND GATE.

SOME HAVE TALKED IN BITTER TONES

SOME HAVE HELD AND FINGERED STONES.

THESE ARE FOLLIES THAT SUBSIDE.

LET US CONSIDER NONE THE LESS

CERTAIN FRAILTIES OF GLASS

WHICH IT CANNOT BE DENIED

LEAD IN TIMES LIKE THESE TO FEAR

FOR CRYSTAL VASE AND CHANDELIER.

NOT THAT MISSILES WILL BE CAST;

NONE AS YET DARE LIFT AN ARM.

BUT THE SCENE RECALLS A STORM

WHEN OUR GRANDSIRE STOOD AGHAST

TO SEE HIS ANTIQUE RUBY BOWL

SHIVERED IN A THUNDER-ROLL.

LET US ONLY BEAR IN MIND

HOW THESE TREASURES HANDED DOWN

FROM A CALMER AGE PASSED ON

ARE IN THE KEEPING OF OUR KIND.

WE STAND BETWEEN THE DEAD GLASS-BLOWERS

AND MURMURINGS OF MISSILE-THROWERS.

BOUNDARY

WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE WILL DO

TO BITE THE LIVING WORLD IN TWO

HALF FOR ME AND HALF FOR YOU.

HERE AT LAST I FIX A LINE

SEVERING THE WORLD’S DESIGN

TOO SMALL TO HOLD BOTH YOURS AND MINE.

THERE’S ENORMITY IN A HAIR

ENOUGH TO LEAD MEN NOT TO SHARE

NARROW CONFINES OF A SPHERE

BUT PUT AN OCEAN OR A FENCE

BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE INTENTS.

A HAIR WOULD SPAN THE DIFFERENCE.

FIVE O’CLOCK BEACON HILL

CURTIS AND I SIT DRINKING AUBURN SHERRY

IN THE RECEPTIVE TWILIGHT OF THE VINES

AND POTTED EXILE SHRUBS WITH SENSITIVE SPINES

GREENING THE GLASS OF THE CONSERVATORY.

CURTIS IN SAND-GREY COAT AND TIE OF MADDER

MEETS ELDER VALUES WITH POLITE NEGATION.

I BETWEEN YEW AND LILY IN RESIGNATION

WATCH LIME-GREEN SHADE ACROSS HIS LEFT CHEEK SPATTER.

GAZING BEYOND MY ELBOW HE ALLOWS

SIGNIFICANCE OF SORTS TO BAUDELAIRE.

HIS PHRASES FLOAT ACROSS THE LUCENT AIR

LIKE EXOTIC LEAVES DETACHED FROM WAXY BOUGHS.

I DRINK OLD SHERRY AND LOOK AT CURTIS’ NOSE—

INTELLIGENT PURITAN FEATURE GRAVE DISCREET

UNQUESTIONABLY A NOSE THAT ONE MIGHT MEET

IN PORTRAITS OF ANTIQUE GENERALISSIMOS.

THE STUDY SEEMS SUFFICIENT RECOMPENSE

FOR CURTIS’ DISSERTATIONS UPON GIDE.

WHAT REBEL BREATHES BENEATH HIS MASK INDEED?

AVANT-GARDE IN TRADITION’S LINEAMENTS!

FROM A CHAPTER ON LITERATURE

AFTER THE SUNLIGHT AND THE FIERY VISION

LEADING US TO A PLACE OF RUNNING WATER

WE CAME INTO A PLACE BY WATER ALTERED.

DEW RIBBONED FROM THOSE TREES THE GRASSES WEPT

AND DROWNED IN THEIR OWN WEEPING; VACANT MIST

CRAWLED LIKE A SNAIL ACROSS THE LAND AND LEFT

A SNAIL’S MOIST TRACE; AND EVERYTHING THERE THRIVING

STARED THROUGH AN AQUEOUS HALF-LIGHT WITHOUT MIRTH

AND BRED BY LANGUID CYCLES WITHOUT ARDOR.

THERE PASSION MILDEWED AND CORRUPTED SLOWLY

TILL FEEDING HOURLY ON ITS OWN CORRUPTION

IT HAD FORGOTTEN FIRE AND ASPIRATION

BECOMING SODDEN WITH APPETITE ALONE.

THERE IN THE GREEN-GREY THICKNESS OF THE AIR

LIVED AND BEGAT COLD SPORES OF INTELLECT

TILL GIANT MOSSES OF A RIMELIKE ASPECT

HUNG HEAVILY FROM THE BOUGHS TO TESTIFY

AGAINST ALL SIMPLE SENSUALITIES

TURNING THEM BY A TOUCH GROSS AND DISCOLORED

SWELLING THE WARM TAUT FLESH TO BLOATED SYMBOL

BY UNRELENTING WATERY PERMEATIONS.

SO FROM PROMETHEAN HOPES WE CAME THIS FAR

THIS FAR FROM LANDS OF SUN AND RACING BLOOD.

BEHIND US LAY THE BLAZING APPLE TREE

BEHIND US TOO THE VULTURE AND THE ROCK—

THE TRAGIC LABOR AND THE HEROIC DOOM—

FOR WITHOUT PASSION THE ROCK ALSO CRUMBLES

AND THE WET TWILIGHT SCARES THE BIRD AWAY.

AN UNSAID WORD

SHE WHO HAS POWER TO CALL HER MAN

FROM THAT ESTRANGED INTENSITY

WHERE HIS MIND FORAGES ALONE

YET KEEPS HER PEACE AND LEAVES HIM FREE

AND WHEN HIS THOUGHTS TO HER RETURN

STANDS WHERE HE LEFT HER STILL HIS OWN

KNOWS THIS THE HARDEST THING TO LEARN.

MATHILDE IN NORMANDY

FROM THE ARCHAIC SHIPS THE GREEN AND RED

INVADERS WOVEN IN THEIR COLORED HOSTS

DESCEND TO CONQUER. HERE IS THE THREADED HEADLAND

THE WARP AND WOOF OF A TIDELESS BEACH THE FLIGHT

RECOUNTED BY SLOW SHUTTLES OF SWIFT ARROWS

AND THE OUTLANDISH ATTITUDES OF DEATH

IN THE STITCHED SOLDIERY. THAT THIS SHOULD PROVE

MORE THAN THE PERSONAL EPISODE MORE THAN ALL

THE LITTLE LIVES SKETCHED ON THE TEEMING LOOM

WAS THEN WITHHELD FROM YOU; SELF-CONSCIOUS HISTORY

THAT WRITES DELIBERATE FOOTNOTES TO ITS ACTION

WAS NOT OF YOUR YOUNG EPOCH. FOR A PASTIME

THE PATIENT HANDIWORK OF LONG-SLEEVED LADIES

WAS ESTEEMED PROPER WHEN THEIR LORDS ABANDONED

THE FIELDS AND APPLE TREES OF NORMANDY

FOR HARSHER HUNTING ON THE OPPOSITE COAST.

YOURS WAS A TIME WHEN WOMEN SAT AT HOME

TO THE PLEASING MINOR AIRS OF LUTE AND HAUTBOIS

WHILE THE BRIGHT SUN ON THE EXPENSIVE THREADS

GLOWED IN THE LONG WINDLESS AFTERNOONS.

SAY WHAT YOU WILL ANXIETY THERE TOO

PLAYED HAVOC WITH THE SKEIN AND THE KNOTS CAME

WHEN FINGERS’ OCCUPATION AND MIND’S ATTENTION

GREW TOO DIVERGENT AT THE KEEN REMEMBRANCE

OF WOODEN SHIPS PUTTING OUT FROM A LONG BEACH

AND THE GREY OCEAN DIMMING TO A VOID

AND THE SICK STRAINED FAREWELLS TOO SHARP FOR SPEECH.

AT A BACH CONCERT

COMING BY EVENING THROUGH THE WINTRY CITY

WE SAID THAT ART IS OUT OF LOVE WITH LIFE.

HERE WE APPROACH A LOVE THAT IS NOT PITY.

THIS ANTIQUE DISCIPLINE TENDERLY SEVERE

RENEWS BELIEF IN LOVE YET MASTERS FEELING

ASKING OF US A GRACE IN WHAT WE BEAR.

FORM IS THE ULTIMATE GIFT THAT LOVE CAN OFFER—

THE VITAL UNION OF NECESSITY

WITH ALL THAT WE DESIRE ALL THAT WE SUFFER.

A TOO-COMPASSIONATE ART IS HALF AN ART.

ONLY SUCH PROUD RESTRAINING PURITY

RESTORES THE ELSE-BETRAYED TOO-HUMAN HEART.

THE RAIN OF BLOOD

IN THE DARK YEAR AN ANGRY RAIN CAME DOWN

BLOOD-RED UPON THE HOT STONES OF THE TOWN.

BENEATH THE PELTING OF THAT LIQUID DROUGHT

NO GARDEN STOOD NO SHATTERED STALK COULD SPROUT

AS FROM A SUNLESS SKY ALL DAY IT RAINED

AND MEN CAME IN FROM STREETS OF TERROR STAINED

WITH THAT UNNATURAL ICHOR. UNDER NIGHT

IMPATIENT LOVERS DID NOT QUENCH THE LIGHT

BUT LISTENING HEARD ABOVE EACH OTHER’S BREATH

THAT SOUND THE DYING HEARD IN ROOMS OF DEATH.

EACH LOUDLY ASKED ABROAD AND NONE DARED TELL

WHAT OMEN IN THAT BURNING TORRENT FELL.

AND ALL NIGHT LONG WE LAY WHILE OVERHEAD

THE DROPS RAINED DOWN AS IF THE HEAVENS BLED;

AND EVERY DAWN WE WOKE TO HEAR THE SOUND

AND ALL MEN KNEW THAT THEY COULD STANCH THE WOUND

BUT EACH LOOKED OUT AND CURSED THE STRICKEN TOWN

THE GUILTY ROOFS ON WHICH THE RAIN CAME DOWN.

STEPPING BACKWARD

GOOD-BY TO YOU WHOM I SHALL SEE TOMORROW

NEXT YEAR AND WHEN I’M FIFTY; STILL GOOD-BY.

THIS IS THE LEAVE WE NEVER REALLY TAKE.

IF YOU WERE DEAD OR GONE TO LIVE IN CHINA

THE EVENT MIGHT DRAW YOUR STATURE IN MY MIND.

I SHOULD BE FORCED TO LOOK UPON YOU WHOLE

THE WAY WE LOOK UPON THE THINGS WE LOSE.

WE SEE EACH OTHER DAILY AND IN SEGMENTS;

PARTING MIGHT MAKE US MEET ANEW ENTIRE.

YOU ASKED ME ONCE AND I COULD GIVE NO ANSWER

HOW FAR DARE WE THROW OFF THE DAILY RUSE

OFFICIAL TREACHERIES OF FACE AND NAME

HAVE OUT OUR TRUE IDENTITY? I COULD HAZARD

AN ANSWER NOW IF YOU ARE ASKING STILL.

WE ARE A SMALL AND LONELY HUMAN RACE

SHOWING NO SIGN OF MASTERING SOLITUDE

OUT ON THIS STONY PLANET THAT WE FARM.

THE MOST THAT WE CAN DO FOR ONE ANOTHER

IS LET OUR BLUNDERS AND OUR BLIND MISCHANCES

ARGUE A CERTAIN BRUSQUE ABRUPT COMPASSION.

WE MIGHT AS WELL BE TRUTHFUL. I SHOULD SAY

THEY’RE LUCKIEST WHO KNOW THEY’RE NOT UNIQUE;

BUT ONLY ART OR COMMON INTERCHANGE

CAN TEACH THAT KINDEST TRUTH. AND EVEN ART

CAN ONLY HINT AT WHAT DISTURBED A MELVILLE

OR CALMED A MAHLER’S FRENZY; YOU AND I

STILL LOOK FROM SEPARATE WINDOWS EVERY MORNING

UPON THE SAME WHITE DAYLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

AND WHEN WE COME INTO EACH OTHER’S ROOMS

ONCE IN AWHILE ENCUMBERED AND SELF-CONSCIOUS

WE HOVER AWKWARDLY ABOUT THE THRESHOLD

AND USUALLY REGRET THE VISIT LATER.

PERHAPS THE HARSHEST FACT IS ONLY LOVERS—

AND ONCE IN A WHILE TWO WITH THE GRACE OF LOVERS—

UNLEARN THAT CLUMSINESS OF RARE INTRUSION

AND LET EACH OTHER FREELY COME AND GO.

MOST OF US SHUT TOO QUICKLY INTO CUPBOARDS

THE MARGIN-SCRIBBLED BOOKS THE DRIED GERANIUM

THE PENNY HOROSCOPE LETTERS NEVER MAILED.

THE DOOR MAY OPEN BUT THE ROOM IS ALTERED;

NOT THE SAME ROOM WE LOOK FROM NIGHT AND DAY.

IT TAKES A LATE AND SLOWLY BLOOMING WISDOM

TO LEARN THAT THOSE WE MARKED INFALLIBLE

ARE TRAGIC-COMIC STUMBLERS LIKE OURSELVES.

THE KNOWLEDGE BREEDS RESERVE. WE WALK ON TIPTOE

DEMANDING MORE THAN WE KNOW HOW TO RENDER.

TWO-EDGED DISCOVERY HUNTS US FINALLY DOWN;

THE HUMAN ACT WILL MAKE US REAL AGAIN

AND THEN PERHAPS WE COME TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

LET US RETURN TO IMPERFECTION’S SCHOOL.

NO LONGER WANDERING AFTER PLATO’S GHOST

SEEKING THE GARDEN WHERE ALL FRUIT IS FLAWLESS

WE MUST AT LAST RENOUNCE THAT ULTIMATE BLUE

AND TAKE A WALK IN OTHER KINDS OF WEATHER.

THE SOUREST APPLE MAKES ITS WRY ANNOUNCEMENT

THAT IMPERFECTION HAS A CERTAIN TANG.

MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T TURN OUR POCKETS OUT

TO THE LAST CRUMB OR LINGERING BIT OF FLUFF

BUT ALL WE CAN CONFESS OF WHAT WE ARE

HAS IN IT THE DEFEAT OF ISOLATION—

IF NOT OUR OWN THEN SOMEONE’S ANYWAY.

SO I COME BACK TO SAYING THIS GOOD-BY

A SORT OF CEREMONY OF MY OWN

THIS STEPPING BACKWARD FOR ANOTHER GLANCE.

PERHAPS YOU’LL SAY WE NEED NO CEREMONY

BECAUSE WE KNOW EACH OTHER CRACK AND FLAW

LIKE TWO IRREGULAR STONES THAT FIT TOGETHER.

YET STILL GOOD-BY BECAUSE WE LIVE BY INCHES

AND ONLY SOMETIMES SEE THE FULL DIMENSION.

YOUR STATURE’S ONE I WANT TO MEMORIZE—

YOUR WHOLE LEVEL OF BEING TO IMPOSE

ON ANY OTHER COMERS MAN OR WOMAN.

I’D ASK THEM THAT THEY CARRY WHAT THEY ARE

WITH YOUR PARTICULAR BEARING AS YOU WEAR

THE FLAWS THAT MAKE YOU BOTH YOURSELF AND HUMAN.

ITINERARY

THE GUIDEBOOKS PLAY DECEPTION; OCEANS ARE

A PROPERTY OF MIND. ALL MAPS ARE FICTION

ALL TRAVELERS COME TO SEPARATE FRONTIERS.

THE COAST THEY SAID IS BARREN; BIRDS GO OVER

UNLIGHTING IN SEARCH OF RICHER INLAND GARDENS.

NO GREEN WEED THRUSTS ITS TENDRIL FROM THE ROCK FACE.

VISIT IT IF YOU MUST; THEN TURN AGAIN

TO THE WARM PLEASING AIR OF COLORED TOWNS

WHERE RIVERS WIND TO LACE THE SUMMER VALLEYS.

THE COAST IS NAKED SHARP WITH CLIFFS UNKIND

THEY SAID; SCRUB-BITTEN. INLAND THERE ARE GROVES

AND FÊTES OF LIGHT AND MUSIC.

BUT I HAVE SEEN

SUCH DENIZENS OF ENCHANTMENT PRINT THESE SANDS

AS SELDOM PROWL THE MARGINS OF OLD CHARTS:

STALLIONS OF VERD ANTIQUE AND WILD BROWN CHILDREN

AND TAILS OF MERMAIDS GLITTERING THROUGH THE SEA!

A REVIVALIST IN BOSTON

BUT YOU SHALL WALK THE GOLDEN STREET

AND YOU UNHOUSE AND HOUSE THE LORD.

—GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS

GOING HOME BY LAMPLIGHT ACROSS BOSTON COMMON

WE HEARD HIM TELL HOW GOD HAD ENTERED IN HIM

AND NOW HE HAD THE WORD AND NOTHING OTHER

WOULD DO BUT HE MUST CRY IT TO HIS BROTHER.

WE STOOD AND LISTENED THERE—TO NOTHING NEW.

YET SOMETHING LOOSED HIS TONGUE AND DROVE HIM SHOUTING.

COMPULSION’S NOT PLAY-ACTED IN A FACE

AND HE WAS TELLING US THE WAY TO GRACE.

SOMEHOW WE SAW THE YOUTH THAT HE HAD BEEN

NOT ONE TO NOTICE; AN ORDINARY BOY—

HARDLY THE ONE THE LORD WOULD MAKE HIS TOOL—

SHUFFLING HIS FEET IN BAPTIST SUNDAY SCHOOL.

AND THEN TRANSFIGURATION CAME HIS WAY;

HE KNEW THE SECRET ALL THE REST WERE SEEKING.

HE MADE THE TALE OF CHRISTENDOM HIS OWN

AND HOARSELY CALLED HIS BRETHREN TO THE THRONE.

THE SAME OLD WAY; AND YET WE KNEW HE SAW

THE ANGELIC HOSTS WHOSE NAMES HE STUMBLED OVER.

HE MADE US HEAR THE RANKS OF SHINING FEET

TREADING TO GLORY’S THRONE UP TREMONT STREET.

THE RETURN OF THE EVENING GROSBEAKS

THE BIRDS ABOUT THE HOUSE PRETEND TO BE

PENATES OF OUR DOMESTICITY.

AND WHEN THE CARDINAL WANTS TO PLAY AT PROPHET

WE NEVER TELL HIS EMINENCE TO COME OFF IT.

THE CROWS TOO IN THE DAWN PROGNOSTICATE

LIKE MINISTERS AT A FUNERAL OF STATE.

THE PIGEONS IN THEIR SURPLICES OF WHITE

ASSEMBLE FOR SOME CAREFUL ANGLICAN RITE.

ONLY THESE GUESTS WHO RARELY COME OUR WAY

DICTATE NO ORACLES FOR US WHILE THEY STAY.

NO MATTER WHAT WE TRY TO MAKE THEM MEAN

THEIR COMING LENDS NO ANSWER TO OUR SCENE.

WE SCATTER SEED AND CALL THEM BY THEIR NAME

REMEMBERING WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE LAST THEY CAME.

THE SPRINGBOARD

LIKE DIVERS WE OURSELVES MUST MAKE THE JUMP

THAT SETS THE TAUT BOARD BOUNDING UNDERFOOT

CLEAN AS AN AXE BLADE DRIVEN IN A STUMP;

BUT AFTERWARD WHAT MAKES THE BODY SHOOT

INTO ITS PURE AND IRRESISTIBLE CURVE

IS OF A FORCE BEYOND ALL BODILY POWERS.

SO ACTION TAKES VELOCITY WITH A VERVE

SWIFTER MORE SURE THAN ANY WILL OF OURS.

A CHANGE OF WORLD

FASHIONS ARE CHANGING IN THE SPHERE.

OCEANS ARE ASKING WAVE BY WAVE

WHAT NEW SHAPES WILL BE WORN NEXT YEAR;

AND THE MOUNTAINS STOOPED AND GRAVE

ARE WONDERING SILENTLY RANGE BY RANGE

WHAT IF THEY PROVE TOO OLD FOR THE CHANGE.

THE LITTLE TAILORS BUSILY SITTING

FLASHING THEIR SHEARS IN RIVAL HASTE

WON’T SPARE TIME FOR A PRIOR FITTING—

IN WITH THE STITCHES TOO LATE TO BASTE.

THEY SAY THE SEASON FOR DOUBT HAS PASSED:

THE CHANGES COMING ARE DUE TO LAST.

UNSOUNDED

MARINER UNPRACTICED

IN THIS CHARTLESS ZONE

EVERY NAVIGATOR

FARES UNWARNED ALONE.

EACH HIS OWN MAGELLAN

IN TROPICS OF SENSATION:

NOT A FIRE-SCORCHED STONE

FROM PRIOR HABITATION

NOT AN ARCHAIC HULL

SPLINTERED ON THE BEACH.

THESE ARE LATITUDES REVEALED

SEPARATE TO EACH.

DESIGN IN LIVING COLORS

EMBROIDERED IN A TAPESTRY OF GREEN

AMONG THE TEXTURES OF A THREADED GARDEN

THE GESTURING LADY AND HER PALADIN

WALK IN A PATH WHERE SHADE AND SUNLIGHT HARDEN

UPON THE FORMAL ATTITUDES OF TREES

BY NO WIND BENT AND BIRDS WITHOUT A TUNE

AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A FIGURED FRIEZE

IN AN ETERNAL SUMMER AFTERNOON.

SO YOU AND I IN OUR ACCEPTED FRAME

BELIEVE A CASUAL WORLD OF BRICKS AND FLOWERS

AND SCARCELY GUESS WHAT SYMBOLS WANDER TAME

AMONG THE PANELS OF FAMILIAR HOURS.

YET SHOULD THE PARTING BOUGHS OF GREEN REVEAL

A SLENDER UNICORN WITH JEWELED FEET

COULD I PERSUADE HIM AT MY TOUCH TO KNEEL

AND FROM MY FINGERS TAKE WHAT UNICORNS EAT?

IF YOU SHOULD PICK ME AT MY WHIM A ROSE

SETTING THE BIRDS UPON THE BUSH IN FLIGHT

HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT CRIMSON MEANING GROWS

DEEP IN THIS GARDEN WHERE SUCH BIRDS ALIGHT?

AND HOW SHOULD I BELIEVE THE MEANING CLEAR

THAT WE ARE CHILDREN OF DISORDERED DAYS?

THAT FRAGMENTARY WORLD IS MENDED HERE

AND IN THIS AIR A CLEARER SUNLIGHT PLAYS.

THE FLEEING HARE THE WINGS THAT BRUSH THE TREE

ALL IMAGES ONCE SEPARATE AND ALONE

BECOME THE CREATURES OF A TAPESTRY

MIRACULOUSLY STIRRED AND MADE OUR OWN.

WE ARE THE DENIZENS OF A LIVING WOOD

WHERE INSIGHT BLOOMS ANEW ON EVERY BOUGH

AND EVERY FLOWER EMERGES UNDERSTOOD

OUT OF A PATTERN UNPERCEIVED TILL NOW.

WALDEN 1950

THOREAU LANK GHOST COMES BACK TO VISIT CONCORD

FINDS THE TOWN LIKE ALL TOWNS MUCH THE SAME—

A LITTLE LESS REMOTE LESS INDEPENDENT.

THE CARS HURL THROUGH FROM DAWN TO DAWN TOWARD BOSTON

PAYING OUT SPEED LIKE A LIFELINE BETWEEN TOWNS.

SOME OF THEM PAUSE TO LOOK AT ALCOTT’S HOUSE.

NO FARMER STUDIES LATIN NOW; THE LANGUAGE

OF SOIL AND MARKET WOULD CONFOUND A SCHOLAR;

AND ANY YANKEE SON WITH LONESOME NOTIONS

WOULD FIND LIFE HARDER IN THE TOWN TODAY.

UNDER THE TREES BY WALDEN POND THE STALLS

WHERE SUMMER PILGRIMS PAUSE BESIDE THE ROAD

DROWN RESINOUS NIGHT IN BUSY RIVALRY

WHILE THE YOUNG MAKE BOISTEROUS LOVE ALONG THE SHORES.

HE USED TO HEAR THE LOCOMOTIVE WHISTLE

SOUND THROUGH THE WOODS LIKE A HAWK’S RESTLESS CRY.

NOW THE TRAINS RUN THROUGH CONCORD NIGHT AND DAY

AND NOBODY STOPS TO LISTEN. THE GHOST MIGHT SMILE—

THE WAY A MAN IN SOLITUDE WOULD SMILE—

REMEMBERING ALL THE SOUNDS THAT PASSED FOR SOUND

A CENTURY AGO.

HE WOULD REMAIN

AWAY FROM HOUSES OTHER GHOSTS MIGHT VISIT

NOT HAVING COME TO TELL A THING OR TWO

OR LAY A CURSE (WHAT CURSE COULD FRIGHTEN NOW?)

NO TAPPING ON THE WINDOWPANE FOR HIM

OR TWILIGHT CONVERSATION IN THE STREETS

WITH SOME BEWILDERED TOWNSMAN GOING HOME.

IF HE HAD ANY ERRAND IT WOULD BE

MORE LIKELY CURIOSITY OF HIS OWN

ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE AT LEAST IN CONCORD.

HE WOULD NOT COME SO FAR FROM DISTANT WOODS

MERELY TO SET THEM WONDERING AGAIN.

SUNDAY EVENING

WE ARE TWO ACQUAINTANCES ON A TRAIN

RATTLING BACK THROUGH DARKENING TWILIGHT SUBURBS

FROM A WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY INTO TOWN.

THE STATION LIGHTS FLARE PAST US AND WE GLANCE

FURTIVELY AT OUR WATCHES SIT UPRIGHT

ON LEATHER BENCHES IN THE SMOKE-DIM CAR

AND TRY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION.

WE COME FROM SIMILAR STREETS IN THE SAME CITY

AND HAVE SPENT THIS SAME HIATUS OF THREE DAYS

ESCAPING STREETS AND LIVES THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN.

ESCAPE BY DECK CHAIRS SPRAWLED ON EVENING LAWNS

BY CITRONELLA AND BY VISITANT MOTHS;

ESCAPE BY SAND AND WATER IN THE EYES

AND SEA-NOISE DROWNED IN WEEKEND CONVERSATION.

UNEASY ALMOST THAT WE MEET AGAIN

IMPATIENT FOR THIS RATTLING RIDE TO END

WE STILL ARE STRICKEN WITH A DREAD OF PASSING

TIME THE COMING LONELINESS OF TRAVELERS

PARTING IN HOLLOW STATIONS GOING HOME

TO SILENT ROOMS IN TOO-FAMILIAR STREETS

WITH UNKNOWN FOOTSTEPS PACING OVERHEAD.

FOR THERE ARE THINGS WE MIGHT HAVE TALKED ABOUT

AND THERE ARE SIGNS WE MIGHT HAVE SHARED IN COMMON.

WE LOOK OUT VAINLY AT THE PASSING STATIONS

AS IF SOME LAMPLIT SHED OR GLEAMING ROOF

MIGHT REAWAKE THE SIGN IN BOTH OF US.

BUT THIS IS ONLY RYE OR DARIEN

AND WHOEVER WE BOTH KNEW THERE HAS MOVED AWAY.

AND I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WILL BE TIME

TO SPEAK OF MORE THAN THIS—THE CHANGE IN WEATHER

THE LATENESS OF THE TRAIN ON SUNDAY EVENINGS—

NEVER ENOUGH OR ALWAYS TOO MUCH TIME.

LIFE LURCHES PAST US LIKE A WINDOWED TWILIGHT

SEEN FROM A TRAIN THAT HALTS AT LITTLE JUNCTIONS

WHERE WEEKEND HALF-ACQUAINTANCES SAY GOOD-BY.

THE INNOCENTS

THEY SAID TO US OR TRIED TO SAY AND FAILED:

WITH DUST IMPLICIT IN THE UNCURLED GREEN

FIRST LEAF AND ALL THE EARLY GARDEN KNOWING

THAT AFTER ROSE-RED PETALS COMES THE BLEAK

IMPOVERISHED STALK THE BLACK DEJECTED LEAF

CRUMPLED AND DANK WE SHOULD AT MAYTIME BE

LESS CHILDLIKE IN DELIGHT A LITTLE RESERVED

A LITTLE COGNIZANT OF ROOTED DEATH.

AND YET BENEATH THE FLECKED LEAF-GILDED BOUGHS

ALONG THE PATHS FERN-FRINGED AND DELICATE

WE SUPPLE CHILDREN PLAYED AT GOLDEN AGE

AND KNELT UPON THE CURVING STEPS TO SNARE

THE WHISKING EMERALD LIZARDS OR TO COAX

THE ANCESTRAL TORTOISE FROM HIS ONYX SHELL

IN LEMON SUNLIGHT ON THE BALCONY.

AND ONLY PEDAGOGUES AND THE BRITTLE OLD

EXISTED TO DECLARE MORTALITY

AND THEY WERE BEINGS REMOVED IN WALK AND SPEECH.

FOR APPREHENSION FEEDS ON INTELLECT:

UNEASY GHOSTS IN LIBRARIES ARE BRED—

WHILE INNOCENT SENSUALITY ABIDES

IN CHARMED PERCEPTION OF AN HOUR A DAY

INGENUOUS AND UNAFRAID OF TIME.

SO IN THE GARDEN WE WERE FREE OF FEAR

AND WHAT THE SAFFRON ROSES OR THE GREEN

IMPERIAL DRAGONFLIES ABOVE THE LAKE

KNEW ABOUT ALTERED SEASONS BOUGHS DESPOILED

THEY NEVER MURMURED; AND TO US NO MATTER

HOW IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE ELDERS SAT

BALANCING TEACUPS BEHIND CURTAINED GLASS

WHILE RARE MIRACULOUS CLOCKS IN CRYSTAL DOMES

IMPALED THE AIR WITH SPLINTERED CHIPS OF TIME

FOREVER SOUNDING THROUGH THE TEA-THIN TALK

AN ORGANPOINT TO DESPERATE ANIMATION.

THEY KNEW AND TRIED TO SAY TO US BUT FAILED;

THEY KNEW WHAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED.

“HE REMEMBERETH THAT WE ARE DUST”

AND WHEN WAS DUST A THING SO RASH?

OR WHEN COULD DUST SUPPORT THE LASH

AND STAND AS ARROGANT AS STONE?

AND WHERE HAS REVELATION SHOWN

CONCEIT AND RAGE SO INTERFUSED

IN DUST THAT SUNS HAVE STOOD BEMUSED

TO WATCH THE RECKLESS CONSEQUENCE?

AND WHEN DID DUST BREAK RETICENCE

TO SING ALOUD WITH ALL ITS MIGHT

IN EGOTISTICAL DELIGHT?

YET WHEN THE TALE IS TOLD OF WIND

THAT LIFTED DUST AND DROVE BEHIND

TO SCOOP THE VALLEYS FROM THEIR SLEEP

AND BURY LANDSCAPES INCHES DEEP

TILL THERE MUST FOLLOW YEARS OF RAIN

BEFORE THE EARTH COULD BREATHE AGAIN—

OR WHEN THE APPETITE OF FIRE

BLAZES BEYOND CONTROL AND HIGHER

THEN SINKS INTO THE SULLEN WASTE

OF WHAT DEVOURING IT EFFACED

AND THINLY IN MY PALM I HOLD

THE DUST OF ASH GROWN WAN AND COLD

I KNOW WHAT ELEMENT I CHOSE

TO BUILD SUCH ANGER MOULD SUCH WOES.

LIFE AND LETTERS

AN OLD MAN’S WASTING BRAIN; A RUINED CITY

WHERE HERE AND THERE AGAINST THE FEBRILE SKY

THE SHAFT OF AN UNBROKEN COLUMN RISES

AND IN THE SANDS INDIFFERENT LIZARDS KEEP

THE SHATTERED TRACES OF OLD MONUMENTS.

HERE WHERE THE DEATH OF THE IMAGINATION

TRANCES THE MIND WITH SHADOW HERE THE SHAPES

OF TUMBLED ARCH AND PEDIMENT STAND OUT

IN THEIR LAST VIOLENCE OF ILLUMINATION.

BY DAY HIS VALET RULES HIM FORCING HIM

WITH MILK AND MEDICINES A DEFERENCE

CLOAKING THE BULLY. “SIGNORA X WAS HERE

DURING YOUR NAP; I TOLD HER DOCTOR’S ORDERS

YOU MUST STAY QUIET AND REST KEEP UP YOUR STRENGTH.”

HE LEAVES THE PASTEBOARD RECTANGLE ENGRAVED

SCRAWLED IN REGRETFUL HASTE AND GOES HIS WAY

TO JOIN A LOUNGING CRONY BELOWSTAIRS.

(“THE OLD MAN’S NOT SO WIDE AWAKE TODAY.”)

THE IVORY BODY IN THE DRESSING GOWN

(NOT THE SILK ROBE THE COUNTESS SENT; HE SPILLS

HIS MILK SOMETIMES AND THAT WOULD BE A PITY)

STIRS IN THE SINKING WARMTH THAT BATHES HIS CHAIR

AND LOOKS ON SUMMER SUNLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

BELOW THE FAT CONCIERGE POINTS OUT HIS WINDOW

WITH HALF-DRAWN BLINDS TO TOURISTS WHO INQUIRE.

THERE ARE A FEW WHO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE;

THEY STAND AND GAZE AND GO AWAY AGAIN.

SOMETHING TO SAY THAT ONE HAS STOOD BENEATH

HIS WINDOW THOUGH THEY NEVER SEE HIMSELF.

THE POST BRINGS LETTERS STAMPED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

HE HOLDS THEM IN HIS FINGERS TURNS THEM OVER.

“HE ALWAYS SAYS HE MEANS TO READ THEM LATER

BUT I SHOULD SAY HIS READING DAYS ARE FINISHED.

ALL HE DOES NOW IS WATCH THE SQUARE BELOW.

HE SEEMS CONTENT ENOUGH; AND I’VE NO TROUBLE.

AN EASY LIFE TO WATCH HIM TO HIS GRAVE.”

THE LETTERS STILL ARRIVE FROM UNIVERSITIES

OCCASIONALLY A CHARITABLE CAUSE

A FAVOR-SEEKER OR AN AGED FRIEND.

BUT NOW IT SEEMS NO ANSWERS ARE EXPECTED

FROM ONE WHOSE CORRESPONDENCE IS COLLECTED

IN TWO LARGE VOLUMES EDITED WITH NOTES.

WHAT SHOULD THAT TIMID HAND BENEATH ITS SLEEVE

WARMED BY THE RICH ITALIAN SUN INDITE

TO VINDICATE ITS FINAL QUARTER-DECADE?

NO; HE HAS WRITTEN ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN.

IF ANYTHING TOO MUCH; HIS GREEDY ART

LEFT NO DOMAIN UNPILLAGED GREW ITS BREADTH

FROM FASTENING ON EVERY LIFE HE TOUCHED.

(SOME WENT TO LAW SOME SMILED SOME NEVER GUESSED.)

BUT NOW THE ART HAS LEFT THE MAN TO REST.

THE FAILING SEARCHLIGHT OF HIS MIND REMAINS

TO THROW ITS WAVERING CONE OF RECOGNITION

BACKWARD UPON THOSE TEEMING IMAGES.

NEW YORK INVADES THE MEMORY AGAIN:

A MILLION JEWELS CROWD THE BOYISH BRAIN

WITH APPREHENSION OF AN UNMASTERED WORLD.

THE RED-HAIRED GIRL WAVES FROM THE BROOKLYN FERRY

THE BRIDGES LEAP LIKE FOUNTAINS INTO NOON.

AGAIN THE TRAIN GOES ROCKING ACROSS-COUNTRY

PAST MIDNIGHT PLATFORMS WHERE THE REDDISH LIGHT

PLAYS ON A GAME OF CHECKERS THROUGH THE WINDOW

TILL DAWN SPELLS SNOW ON EMPTINESS OF PLAINS.

ONCE MORE IN SAN FRANCISCO MARGARET WAKES

BESIDE HIM IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST DARK

STILL WEEPING FROM A NIGHTMARE.

SO BY DAY

HE LOOKS ON SUMMER SUNLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

THE GRINNING BACCHUS TRICKLES FROM HIS GOURD

A THIN BRIGHT SPUME OF WATER IN THE BASIN

WHILE THE HOT TILES GROW COOL AS EVENING DROPS

DEEP COBALT FROM WHITE BUILDINGS. FAR IN AIR

BUONARROTI’S DOME DELAYS THE GOLD.

THE OLD MAN WHO HAS COME TO ROME TO DIE

IGNORES THE DEATH OF STILL ANOTHER DAY.

SO MANY DAYS HAVE DIED AND COME TO LIFE

THAT TIME AND PLACE SEEM ORDERED BY HIS VALET;

HE PUTS THEM ON AND OFF AS HE IS TOLD.

NOW HE IS STANDING BAREHEADED IN DUSK

WHILE FIREWORKS RAIN INTO THE SEA AT BIARRITZ

AND AT HIS SHOULDER LOUIS SCARAPIN

QUOTES LA FONTAINE. THE GIDDY WINDS OF FORTUNE

MAKE LOVE TO HIM THAT NIGHT; AND HE RECALLS

TOASTS DRUNK BY ROCKETLIGHT AND LOUIS’ VOICE

WITH ITS PERPETUAL DRAWL: “MON BON MONSIEUR …”

LOUIS WHO COULD HAVE MADE THE WORLD MORE SANE

BUT KILLED HIMSELF INSTEAD A PIERROT-GESTURE

HIS FACE A WHITENESS IN THE DARK APARTMENT.

THE BITTER COFFEE DRUNK ON EARLY MORNINGS

WITH SANDRA’S STRAW HAT HANGING FROM THE BEDPOST

RED ROSES LIKE A BONNET BY RENOIR.

AND THE INCESSANT TAPPING OF HER HEELS

LATE EVENINGS ON THE COBBLES AS THEY STROLL:

SPLINTERS TO TINGLE IN AN OLD MAN’S BRAIN.

AGAIN THE CONSUMPTIVE NEIGHBOR THROUGH THE WALL

BEGINS HIS EVENING AGONY OF COUGHING

TILL ONE IS READY TO SCREAM HIM INTO SILENCE.

AND THE ACCORDION ON THE RIVER STEAMER

PLAYS SOMETHING FROM LAST SEASON FOOLISH GAY;

DEAF EARS PRESERVE THE MUSIC OF A DAY.

LIFE HAS THE FINAL WORD; HE CANNOT RULE

THOSE FLOATING PICTURES AS HE RULED THEM ONCE

FORCING THEM INTO FORM; THE VIOLENT GARDENER

THE TWO-EDGED HEART THAT CUTS INTO EVERY WOUND

RECIPROCATES EXPERIENCE WITH ART.

NO MORE OF THAT FOR NOW; THE BOUGHS GROW WILD

THE WILLFUL STEMS PUT FORTH UNDISCIPLINED BLOOMS

AND WINDS SWEEP THROUGH AND SHATTER. HERE AT LAST

ANARCHY OF A THOUSAND ROSES TANGLES

THE FALLEN ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIND.

FOR THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO PLANETS

WE SMILE AT ASTROLOGICAL HOPES

AND LEAVE THE SKY TO EXPERT MEN

WHO DO NOT RECKON HOROSCOPES

BUT PAINFULLY EXTEND THEIR KEN

IN MATHEMATICAL DEBATE

WITH SLIDE AND PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE.

AND YET PROTEST IT IF WE WILL

SOME CORNER OF THE MIND RETAINS

THE MEDIEVAL MAN WHO STILL

KEEPS WATCH UPON THOSE STARRY SKEINS

AND DRIVES US OUT OF DOORS AT NIGHT

TO GAZE AT ANAGRAMS OF LIGHT.

WHATEVER REGISTER OR LAW

IS DRAWN IN DIGITS FOR THESE TWO

VENUS AND JUPITER KEEP THEIR AWE

WARDENS OF BRILLIANCE AS THEY DO

THEIR DUAL CIRCUIT OF THE WEST—

THE BRIGHTEST PLANET AND HER GUEST.

IS ANY LIGHT SO PROUDLY THRUST

FROM DARKNESS ON OUR LIFTED FACES

A SIGN OF SOMETHING WE CAN TRUST

OR IS IT THAT IN STARRY PLACES

WE SEE THE THINGS WE LONG TO SEE

IN FIERY ICONOGRAPHY?

THE PRISONERS

ENCLOSED IN THIS DISTURBING MUTUAL WOOD

WOUNDED ALIKE BY THORNS OF THE SAME TREE

WE SEEK IN HOPELESS WAR EACH OTHER’S BLOOD

THOUGH SUFFERING IN ONE IDENTITY.

EACH TO THE OTHER PREY AND HUNTSMAN KNOWN

STILL DRIVEN TOGETHER LONELIER THAT ALONE.

STRANGE MATING OF THE LOSER AND THE LOST!

WITH FACES STIFF AS MOURNERS’ WE INTRUDE

FOREVER ON THE ONE EACH TURNS FROM MOST

EACH WANDERING IN A DOUBLE SOLITUDE.

THE UNPURGED GHOSTS OF PASSION BOUND BY PRIDE

WHO WAKE IN ISOLATION SIDE BY SIDE.

1950

NIGHT

THE MOTES THAT STILL DISTURBED HER LIDDED CALM

WERE THESE: THE TICK AND WHISPER OF A SHADE

AGAINST THE SILL; A COBWEB-FILM THAT HUNG

ASLANT A CORNER MOULDING TOO ELUSIVE

FOR ANY BUT THE GAZE OF STRAITENED EYES;

THE NIMBUS OF THE NIGHT-LAMP WHERE A MOTH

UNEASILY EXPLORED THE EDGE OF LIGHT

THROUGH HOURS OF FRACTURED DARKNESS. SHE ALONE

KNEW THAT THE ROOM CONTAINED THESE THINGS; SHE LAY

HEARING THE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SOUND

(AS IF A LIVE THING SHIVERED BEHIND THE CURTAINS)

WATCHING THE THREAD THAT FRAYED IN GUSTS OF AIR

MORE DELICATE THAN HER BREATHING OR BY NIGHT

SHARING A MOTH’S PERPLEXITY AT LIGHT

TOO FRAIL TO DRIVE OUT DARK: MINUTIAE

HELD IN THE VISE OF SENSE ABOUT TO DIE.

1950

THE HOUSE AT THE CASCADES

ALL CHANGED NOW THROUGH NEGLECT. THE STEPS DISMANTLED

BY INFANTRIES OF ANTS BY ROOTS AND STORMS

THE PILLARS TUGGED BY VINES THE PORTE-COCHÈRE

A PASSAGEWAY FOR WINDS THE SOLEMN PORCHES

WARPED INTO CARICATURES.

WE CAME AT EVENING

AFTER THE RAIN WHEN EVERY DRUNKEN LEAF

WAS STRAINING SWELLING IN A RIOT OF GREEN.

ONLY THE HOUSE WAS DYING IN ALL THAT LIFE

AS IF A TRIUMPH OF EMERALD ENERGY

HAD FIXED ITS MOUTH UPON THE WALLS AND STONES.

THE TAMEST SHRUB REMEMBERED ANARCHY

AND JOINED IN APPETITE WITH THE DEMAGOGUE WEED

THAT SPRINGS WHERE ORDER FALLS; TOGETHER THERE

THEY STORMED THE DEFENSELESS HANDIWORK OF MAN

WHOSE EMPIRE WARS AGAINST HIM WHEN HE TURNS

A MOMENT FROM THE YOKE. SO TURNING BACK

HE SEES HIS ROOFTREE FALL TO FURIOUS GREEN

HIS YARD DESPOILED AND OUT OF INNOCENT NOON

THE INSECT-CLOUD LIKE THUNDER ON THE LAND.

1951

THE ROADWAY

WHEN THE FOOTBRIDGE WASHES AWAY

AND THE LIGHTS ALONG THE BANK

ACCOST EACH OTHER NO LONGER

BUT THE WILD GRASS GROWS UP RANK

AND NO ONE COMES TO STAND

WHERE NEIGHBOR AND NEIGHBOR STOOD

AND EACH HOUSE IS DRAWN IN TO ITSELF

AND SHUTTERED AGAINST THE ROAD

UNDER EACH SEPARATE ROOF

THE FAMILIAR LIFE GOES ON:

THE HEARTH IS SWEPT UP AT NIGHT

THE TABLE LAID IN THE DAWN

AND MAN AND WOMAN AND CHILD

EAT THEIR ACCUSTOMED MEAL

GIVE THANKS AND TURN TO THEIR DAY

AS IF BY AN ACT OF WILL.

NOWHERE IS EVIL SPOKEN

THOUGH SOMETHING DEEP IN THE HEART

REFUSES TO MEND THE BRIDGE

AND CAN NEVER MAKE A START

ALONG THE ABANDONED PATH

TO THE HOUSE AT LEFT OR AT RIGHT

WHERE NEIGHBOR AND NEIGHBOR’S CHILDREN

AWAKE TO THE SAME DAYLIGHT.

GOOD MEN GROWN LONG ACCUSTOMED

TO INFLEXIBLE WAYS OF MIND—

WHICH OF THEM COULD SAY CLEARLY

WHAT FIRST DROVE KIND FROM KIND?

COURTEOUS TO ANY STRANGER

FORBEARING WITH WIFE AND CHILD—

YET ALONG THE COMMON ROADWAY

THE WILD GRASS STILL GROWS WILD.

PICTURES BY VUILLARD

NOW WE REMEMBER ALL: THE WILD PEAR-TREE

THE BROKEN RIBBONS OF THE GREEN-AND-GOLD

PORTFOLIO WITH SKETCHES FROM AN OLD

ALGERIAN CAMPAIGN; THE PLACID THREE

WOMEN AT COFFEE BY THE WINDOW FATES

OF NOTHING OMINOUS WAITING FOR THE RING

OF THE POSTMAN’S BELL; WE HARBOR EVERYTHING—

THE CORES OF FRUIT LEFT ON THE LUNCHEON PLATES.

WE ARE LED BACK WHERE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN

MIDDAY WHERE NOTHING’S TRAGIC ALL’S DELAYED

AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR US AS WELL—THAT SHADE

OF SUMMER ALWAYS NEUILLY DAPPLED GREEN!

BUT WE THE DESTINED READERS OF STENDHAL

IN MONSTROUS CHANGE SUCH CONSOLATIONS FIND

AS RESTLESS MOCKERY SETS BEFORE THE MIND

TO DEAL WITH WHAT MUST ANGER AND APPALL.

MUCH OF THE TIME WE SCARCELY THINK OF SIGHING

FOR AFTERNOONS THAT FOUND US BORN TOO LATE.

OUR PRUDENT ENVY RARELY PACES SPYING

UNDER THOSE WALLS THAT LILAC-SHADOWED GATE.

YET AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR PRIVATE VIEW

A BREATH OF COMMON PEACE LIKE MEMORY

RUSTLES THE BRANCHES OF THE WILD PEAR-TREE—

AIR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AND CANNOT KNOW.

ORIENT WHEAT

OUR FATHERS IN THEIR BOOKS AND SPEECH

HAVE MADE THE MATTER PLAIN:

THE GREEN FIELDS THEY WALKED IN ONCE

WILL NEVER GROW AGAIN.

THE CORN LIES UNDER THE LOCUST’S TOOTH

OR BLISTERED IN THE SUN;

THE FACES OF THE OLD PROUD STOCK

ARE GONE WHERE THEIR YEARS ARE GONE.

THE PARK WHERE STAGS LAY DOWN AT NOON

UNDER THE GREAT TREES

IS SHRILL WITH SUNDAY STROLLERS NOW

LITTERED WITH THEIR LEES.

POACHERS HAVE TRAMPLED DOWN THE MAZE

AND CHOKED THE FOUNTAINS DRY;

THE LAST SWAN OF A SCORE AND TEN

GOES AMONG REEDS TO DIE.

WE WERE BORN TO SMELLS OF PLAGUE

CHALK-MARKS ON EVERY DOOR;

WE NEVER HAVE HEARD THE HUNTING-HORN

OR FEET ON THE GALLERY FLOOR—

THE HIGH-ARCHED FEET OF DANCERS

WHO KNEW HOW TO STEP AND STAND.

WE WERE BORN OF A LEANING HOUSE

IN A CHANGED UNEASY LAND.

OUR FATHERS CURSE THE CROOKED TIME

AND GO TO THEIR GRAVES AT LAST;

WHILE SOME OF US LAUGH AT DOTING MEN

AND OTHERS SIGH FOR THE PAST.

AND THE DAZZLED LOVERS LIE

WHERE SUMMER BURNS BLUE AND GREEN

IN THE GREEN FIELDS THEY’LL BE SAYING

CAN NEVER GROW AGAIN.

VERSAILLES

(PETIT TRIANON)

MERELY THE LANDSCAPE OF A VANISHED WHIM

AN ARTIFICE THAT LASTS BEYOND THE WISH:

THE GROTTO BY THE POND THE GULPING FISH

THAT ROUND AND ROUND PRETENDED ISLANDS SWIM

THE CREAMERY ABANDONED TO ITS DOVES

THE EMPTY SHRINE THE GUIDEBOOKS SAY IS LOVE’S.

WHAT WIND CAN BLEAKEN THIS WHAT WEATHER CHASTEN

THOSE BALUSTRADES OF STONE THAT SKY STONE-PALE?

A FOUNTAIN TRITON IDLY SOAKS HIS TAIL

IN THE LAST PUDDLE OF A DRYING BASIN;

A LEISURE THAT NO HUMAN WILL CAN HASTEN

DRIPS FROM THE HOLLOW OF HIS LIFTED SHELL.

WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER GARDENS WERE FOR GAMES

BUT NOW ACROSS THE SUNGILT LAWN OF KINGS

WE DRIFT CONSULTING CATALOGUES FOR NAMES

OF POSTURED GODS: THE CRY OF CLOSING RINGS

FOR US AND FOR THE COUPLES IN THE WOOD

AND ALL GOOD CHILDREN WHO ARE ALL TOO GOOD.

O CHILDREN NEXT YEAR CHILDREN YOU WILL PLAY

WITH ONLY HALF YOUR HEARTS; BE WILD TODAY.

AND LOVERS TAKE ONE LONG AND FAST EMBRACE

BEFORE THE SUN THAT TARNISHED QUEENS GOES DOWN

AND EVENING FINDS YOU IN A RESTLESS TOWN

WHERE EACH HAS BACK HIS OLD RESTRICTED FACE.

ANNOTATION FOR AN EPITAPH

A FAIRER PERSON LOST NOT HEAVEN.

—PARADISE LOST

THESE ARE THE SINS FOR WHICH THEY CAST OUT ANGELS

THE BAGATELLES BY WHICH THE LOVELY FALL:

A HAND THAT DISAPPOINTS AN EYE DISSEMBLING—

THESE AND A FEW BESIDES: YOU HAD THEM ALL.

BENEATH THIS CHERUBED STONE RECLINES THE BEAUTY

THAT CHERUBS AT THE CHAIR WILL NEVER SEE

SHUT OUT FOREVER BY THE GOLD BATTALIONS

STERN TO FORGIVE MORE RIGOROUS THAN WE.

OH WE WERE QUICK TO HIDE OUR EYES FROM FOIBLE

AND CALL SUCH BEAUTY TRUTH; WHAT THOUGH WE KNEW?

NEVER WAS TRUTH SO SWEET AND SO OUTRAGEOUS;

WE LOVED YOU ALL THE MORE BECAUSE UNTRUE.

BUT IN THE BAROQUE CORRIDORS OF HEAVEN

YOUR LIVELY COMING IS A HOPE DESTROYED.

SQUADRONS OF SERAPHS PASS THE NEWS AND PONDER

AND ALL THEIR LUXURY GLITTERS GRAND AND VOID.

IDEAL LANDSCAPE

WE HAD TO TAKE THE WORLD AS IT WAS GIVEN:

THE NURSEMAID SITTING PASSIVE IN THE PARK

WAS RARELY BY A CHANGELING PRINCE ACCOSTED.

THE MORNINGS HAPPENED SIMILAR AND STARK

IN ROOMS OF SELFHOOD WHERE WE WOKE AND LAY

WATCHING TODAY UNFOLD LIKE YESTERDAY.

OUR FRIENDS WERE NOT UNEARTHLY BEAUTIFUL

NOR SPOKE WITH TONGUES OF GOLD; OUR LOVERS BLUNDERED

NOW AND AGAIN WHEN MOST WE SOUGHT PERFECTION

OR HID IN CUPBOARDS WHEN THE HEAVENS THUNDERED.

THE HUMAN ROSE TO HAUNT US EVERYWHERE

RAW FLAWED AND ASKING MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR.

AND ALWAYS TIME WAS RUSHING LIKE A TRAM

THROUGH STREETS OF A FOREIGN CITY STREETS WE SAW

OPENING INTO GREAT AND SUNNY SQUARES

WE COULD NOT FIND AGAIN NO MAP COULD SHOW—

NEVER THOSE FOUNTAINS TOSSED IN THAT SAME LIGHT

THOSE GILDED TREES THOSE STATUES GREEN AND WHITE.

THE CELEBRATION
IN THE PLAZA

THE SENTIMENTALIST SENDS HIS MAUVE BALLOON

MEANDERING INTO AIR. THE CROWD APPLAUDS.

THE MAYOR EATS ICES WITH A CARDBOARD SPOON.

SEE HOW THAT COLOR CHARMS THE SUNSET AIR;

A TOUCH OF LAVENDER IS WHAT WAS NEEDED.—

THEN POP! NO FLOATING LAVENDER ANYWHERE.

HURRAH THE PYROTECHNIC ENGINEER

COMES WITH HIS SPARKLING TRICKS CONSULTS THE SKY

WAITS FOR THE PERFECT INSTANT TO APPEAR.

BOUQUETS OF GOLD SPLASH INTO BLOOM AND POUR

THEIR HISSING POLLEN DOWNWARD ON THE DUSK.

NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.

THE VICEROY OF FIREWORKS GOES HIS WAY

LEAVING US WITH A SKY SO DULL AND BARE

THE CROWD THINS OUT: WHAT CONJURES THEM TO STAY?

THE ROAD IS COLD WITH DEW AND BY AND BY

WE SEE THE CONSTELLATIONS OVERHEAD.

BUT IS THAT ALL? SOME LITTLE CHILDREN CRY.

ALL WE HAVE LEFT THEIR PEDAGOGUES REPLY.

THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN

(SAN MINIATO AL MONTE)

THOSE CLARITIES DETACHED US GAVE US FORM

MADE US LIKE ARCHITECTURE. NOW NO MORE

BEMUSED BY LOCAL MIST OUR EDGES BLURRED

WE KNEW WHERE WE BEGAN AND ENDED. THERE

WE WERE THE CAMPANILE AND THE DOME

ALIVE AND SEPARATE IN THAT BELL-STRUCK AIR

CLIMATE WHOSE LIGHT REFORMED OUR RANDOM LINE

EDGED OUR INTENT AND SHARPENED OUR DESIRE.

COULD IT BE ALWAYS SO—A WEEK OF SUNLIGHT

WALKS WITH A GUIDEBOOK PICKING OUT OUR WAY

THROUGH VERBS AND RUINS YET FINDING AFTER ALL

THE PROMISED VISTA ONCE!—THE LIGHT HAS CHANGED

BEFORE WE CAN MAKE IT OURS. WE HAVE NO CHOICE:

WE ARE ONLY TOURISTS UNDER THAT BLUE SKY

READING THE POSTERS ON THE STATION WALL—

COME TAKE A WALKING-TRIP THROUGH HAPPINESS.

THERE IS A MYSTERY THAT FLOATS BETWEEN

THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN. IMAGINATION

ESTRANGES IT FROM HER. SHE NEED NOT SUFFER

OR DIE HERE. IT IS NONE OF HER AFFAIR

ITS CALM HEROIC VISTAS MAKE NO CLAIM.

HER BARGAINS WITH DISASTER HAVE BEEN SEALED

IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. HERE SHE GOES UNTOUCHED

AND THIS IS ALIENATION. ONLY SOMETIMES

IN CERTAIN TOWNS SHE OPENS CERTAIN LETTERS

FORWARDED ON FROM BITTER ORIGINS

THAT SEND HER WALKING SICK AND HAUNTED THROUGH

MYSTERIOUS AND ORDINARY STREETS

THAT ARE NO MORE THAN STREETS TO WALK AND WALK—

AND THEN THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN ARE ONE.

TO WORK AND SUFFER IS TO BE AT HOME.

ALL ELSE IS SCENERY: THE RATHAUS FOUNTAIN

THE SKATERS IN THE SUNSET ON THE LAKE

AT SALZBURG OR EMERGING AFTER SNOW

THE SINGULAR CLEAR STARS AT CASTELLANE.

TO WORK AND SUFFER IS TO COME TO KNOW

THE ANGLES OF A ROOM LIGHT IN A SQUARE

AS CONVALESCENTS KNOW THE FACE OF ONE

WHO HAS WATCHED BESIDE THEM. YOURS NOW EVERY STREET

THE NOONDAY SWARM ACROSS THE BRIDGE THE BELLS

BRUISING THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWDED ROOFS

THE AVENUE OF CHESTNUT-TREES THE ROAD

TO THE POST-OFFICE. ONCE UPON A TIME

ALL THESE FOR YOU WERE FICTION. NOW MADE FREE

YOU LIVE AMONG THEM. YOUR BREATH IS ON THIS AIR

AND YOU ARE THEIRS AND OF THEIR MYSTERY.

BEARS

WONDERFUL BEARS THAT WALKED MY ROOM ALL NIGHT

WHERE ARE YOU GONE YOUR SLEEK AND FAIRY FUR

YOUR EYES’ VEILED IMPERIOUS LIGHT?

BROWN BEARS AS RICH AS MOCHA OR AS MUSK

WHITE OPALESCENT BEARS WHOSE FUR STOOD OUT

ELECTRIC IN THE DEEPENING DUSK

AND GREAT BLACK BEARS WHO SEEMED MORE BLUE THAN BLACK

MORE VIOLET THAN BLUE AGAINST THE DARK—

WHERE ARE YOU NOW? UPON WHAT TRACK

MUTTER YOUR MUFFLED PAWS THAT USED TO TREAD

SO SOFTLY SURELY UP THE CREAKLESS STAIR

WHILE I LAY LISTENING IN BED?

WHEN DID I LOSE YOU? WHOSE HAVE YOU BECOME?

WHY DO I WAIT AND WAIT AND NEVER HEAR

YOUR THICK NOCTURNAL PACING IN MY ROOM?

MY BEARS WHO KEEPS YOU NOW IN PRIDE AND FEAR?

THE INSUSCEPTIBLES

THEN THE LONG SUNLIGHT LYING ON THE SEA

FELL FOLDED GOLD ON GOLD; AND SLOWLY WE

TOOK UP OUR DECKS OF CARDS OUR PARASOLS

THE PICNIC HAMPER AND THE SANDBLOWN SHAWLS

AND CLIMBED THE DUNES IN SILENCE. THERE WERE TWO

WHO LAGGED BEHIND AS LOVERS SOMETIMES DO

AND TOOK A DIFFERENT ROAD. FOR US THE NIGHT

WAS FINAL AND BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT

WE CAME INDOORS TO SLEEP. NO ENVY THERE

OF THOSE WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING ANYWHERE

THE LUSTRES OF THE SUMMER DARK TO TRACE

SOME VAGRANT SPLINTER BLAZING OUT OF SPACE.

NO THOUGHT OF THEM SAVE IN A LOWER ROOM

TO LEAVE A LIGHT FOR THEM WHEN THEY SHOULD COME.

LUCIFER IN THE TRAIN

RIDING THE BLACK EXPRESS FROM HEAVEN TO HELL

HE BIT HIS FINGERS WATCHED THE COUNTRYSIDE

VERNAL AND CRYSTALLINE FOREVER SLIDE

BEYOND HIS GAZE: THE LONG CASCADES THAT FELL

RIBBONED IN SUNSHINE FROM THEIR SPARKLING HEIGHT

THE FISHERS FASTENED TO THEIR POOLS OF GREEN

BY SILVER LINES; THE BIRDS IN SUDDEN FLIGHT—

ALL THINGS THE DIABOLIC EYE HAD SEEN

SINCE HEAVEN’S COCKCROW. IMPERCEPTIBLY

THAT LANDSCAPE ALTERED: NOW IN PALER AIR

TREE HILL AND ROCK STOOD OUT RESIGNED SEVERE

BESIDE THE STRANGLED FIELD THE STREAM RUN DRY.

LUCIFER WE ARE YOURS WHO STIFF AND MUTE

RIDE OUT OF WORLDS WE SHALL NOT SEE AGAIN

AND WATCH FROM WINDOWS OF A SMOKING TRAIN

THE ASHEN PRAIRIES OF THE ABSOLUTE.

ONCE OUT OF HEAVEN TO AN ANGEL’S EYE

WHERE IS THE BUSH OR CLOUD WITHOUT A FLAW?

WHAT BIRD BUT FEEDS UPON MORTALITY

FLIES TO ITS YOUNG WITH CARRION IN ITS CLAW?

O FOUNDERED ANGEL FIRST AND LONELIEST

TO TURN THIS BITTER SAND BENEATH YOUR HOE

TEACH US THE NEWLY-LANDED WHAT YOU KNOW;

AFTER OUR WEARY TRANSIT FIND US REST.

RECORDERS IN ITALY

IT WAS AMUSING ON THAT ANTIQUE GRASS

SEATED HALFWAY BETWEEN THE GREEN AND BLUE

TO WAKEN MUSIC GENTLE AND EXTINCT

UNDER THE OLD WALLS WHERE THE DAISIES GREW

SPRINKLED IN CINQUECENTO STYLE AS THOUGH

ARCHANGELS MIGHT HAVE STEPPED THERE YESTERDAY.

BUT IT WAS WE MORTAL AND YOUNG WHO STROLLED

AND FLUTED QUAVERING MUSIC FOR A DAY

CASUAL HEIRS OF ALL WE LOOKED UPON.

SUCH PIPERS OF THE EMERALD AFTERNOON

COULD ONLY BE THE HEIRS OF PERFECT TIME

WHEN EVERY LEAF DISTINCTLY BRUSHED WITH GOLD

LISTENED TO PRIMAVERA SPEAKING FLOWERS.

THOSE SCHERZOS STUMBLE NOW; OUR JOURNEYS RUN

TO HARSHER HILLSIDES ROCKIER DECLENSIONS.

OBLIGATORY CLIMATES CALL US HOME.

AND SO SHALL CLARITY OF CYPRESSES

UNFINGERED BY NECESSITY BECOME

MERELY THE GHOST OF HALF-REMEMBERED TREES

A TRICK OF SUNLIGHT FLATTERING THE MIND?—

THERE WERE FOUR RECORDERS SWEET UPON THE WIND.

AT HERTFORD HOUSE

PERFECTION NOW IS TENDED AND OBSERVED

NOT USED; WE HIRE THE SPAWN OF CALIBAN

FOR DAILY SERVICE. IN OUR CAREFUL WORLD

INLAY OF PURPLE-WOOD AND TULIP CURVED

TO MIME THE SHEEN OF PLUMES AND PEACOCKS’ EYES

EXISTS FOR INSPECTION ONLY. AND THE JARS

OF APPLE-GREEN AND WHITE WHERE WOOING’S DONE

IN PANELS AFTER BOUCHER—SUCH WE PRIZE

TOO WELL TO FILL WITH ROSES. CHOCOLATE TOO

WILL NOT AGAIN BE FROTHED IN CUPS LIKE THESE;

WE MOVE METICULOUSLY ILL AT EASE

AMID PERFECTIONS. WHY SHOULD A PORCELAIN PLAQUE

WHERE VENUS PULLS HER POUTING ADON ON

THROUGH BEDS OF BLUSHING FLOWERS SEEM UNFIT

FOR CASUAL THUMBPRINT? EASE IS WHAT WE LACK.

THERE’S A DIVISION NOTHING CAN MAKE SWEET

BETWEEN THE CLODS OF USAGE AND THE TOYS

WE STRUM OUR SENSES WITH. BUT ANTOINETTE

RAN HER LONG TORTOISE-SHELL AND SILVER COMB

THROUGH POWDERED YELLOW HAIR AND WOULD HAVE LAUGHED

TO THINK THAT USE TOO MEAN FOR ART OR CRAFT.

THE WILD SKY

HERE FROM THE CORRIDOR OF AN ENGLISH TRAIN

I SEE THE LANDSCAPE SLIDE THROUGH GLANCING RAIN

A LAND SO PERSONAL THAT EVERY LEAF

UNFOLDS AS IF TO WITNESS HUMAN LIFE

AND EVERY AGING MILESTONE SEEMS TO KNOW

THAT HUMAN HANDS INSCRIBED IT LONG AGO.

OASTHOUSE AND GARDEN NARROW BRIDGE AND HILL—

LANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES WHERE A CHANGE OF STYLE

COMES SOFTENED IN A WATER-COLOUR LIGHT

BY CONSTABLE; AND ALWAYS SHIRE ON SHIRE

THE LOW-PITCHED SKY SAGS LIKE A TENT OF AIR

BENEATH ITS ANCIENT IMMATERIAL WEIGHT.

THE WEATHER IN THESE GENTLE PROVINCES

MOVES LIKE THE SHIFT OF DAYLIGHT IN A HOUSE

SUBDUED BY TIME AND CUSTOM. SUN AND RAIN

ARE INTIMATE COMPLAISANT TO ROUTINE

GUESTS IN THE GARDEN. YEAR ON COUNTRY YEAR

HAS WORN THE EDGE OF WILDNESS FROM THIS AIR.

AND I REMEMBER THAT UNBLUNTED LIGHT

POURED OUT ALL DAY FROM A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT—

MY COUNTRY WHERE THE BLUE IS MILES TOO HIGH

FOR MINDS OF MEN TO GRAZE THE LEANING SKY.

THE TELEGRAPH MAY RISE OR TIMBER FALL

THAT LAST FRONTIER REMAINS THE VERTICAL.

MEN THERE ARE BEANSTALK CLIMBERS ALL DAY LONG

HAUNTED BY STILTS THEY CLATTERED ON WHEN YOUNG.

GIANTS NO LONGER NOW AT MORTAL SIZE

THEY STARE INTO THAT UPWARD WILDERNESS.

THE VERTICAL REMINDS THEM WHAT THEY ARE

AND I REMEMBER I AM NATIVE THERE.

THE PROSPECT

YOU PROMISE ME WHEN CERTAIN THINGS ARE DONE

WE’LL CLOSE THESE ROOMS ABOVE A CITY SQUARE

AND STEALING OUT BY HALF-LIGHT WILL BE GONE

WHEN NEXT THE TELEPHONE BREAKS THE WAITING AIR.

BEFORE THEY SEND TO FIND US WE SHALL BE

ABOARD A BLUNT-NOSED STEAMER AT WHOSE RAIL

WE’LL WATCH THE LOADING OF THE LAST BROWN BALE

AND FEEL THE CHANNEL ROUGHENING INTO SEA.

AND AFTER MANY SUNLIT DAYS WE’LL SIGHT

THE COAST YOU TELL ME OF. ALONG THAT SHORE

RARE SHELLS LIE TUMBLED AND THE SEAS OF LIGHT

DIP PAST THE GOLDEN ROCKS TO CRASH AND POUR

UPON THE BOWL-SHAPED BEACH. IN THAT CLEAR BAY

WE’LL SCOOP FOR PEBBLES TILL OUR FEET AND HANDS

ARE GILDED BY THE WASH OF BLENDING SANDS;

AND THOUGH THE BOAT LIFT ANCHOR WE SHALL STAY.

YOU WILL DISCOVER IN THE WOODS BEYOND

THE CREATURES YOU HAVE LOVED ON CHINESE SILK:

THE SHELL-GRAY FOX GAZELLES THAT AT YOUR SOUND

WILL LIFT THEIR EYES AS CALM AS GOLDEN MILK.

THE LEAVES AND GRASSES FEATHERED INTO PLUMES

WILL SHADOW-EDGE THEIR PALE CALLIGRAPHY;

AND IN THE EVENING YOU WILL COME TO ME

TO TELL OF HONEY THICK IN SILVER COMBS.

YET IN THE DRIFT OF MOMENTS UNENDEARED

BY SAMENESS WHEN THE CRACKS OF MORNING SHOW

ONLY A REPLICA OF DAYS WE’VE MARRED

WITH STILL THE SAME OLD PENANCES TO DO

IN FURNISHED ROOMS ABOVE A CITY SQUARE

EATING THE RIND OF FACT I SOMETIMES DREAD

THE PROMISE OF THAT HONEY-BREEDING AIR

THOSE UNAPPORTIONED CLUSTERS OVERHEAD.

EPILOGUE FOR A
MASQUE OF PURCELL

BEAST AND BIRD MUST BOW ASIDE

GRIMBALD LIMP INTO THE WINGS.

ALL THAT’S LOVELY AND ABSURD

ALL THAT DANCES ALL THAT SINGS

FOLDED INTO TRUNKS AGAIN—

THE HAUNTED GROVE THE STARLIT AIR—

ALL TURNS WORKADAY AND PLAIN

EVEN THE HAPPY HAPPY PAIR.

HARPSICHORD AND TRUMPET GO

TRUNDLING DOWN THE DUSTY HALL.

THAT AIRY JOY THAT POSTURED WOE

LIKE THE BLACK MAGICIAN’S SPELL

FALL IN PIECES ROUND US NOW

WHILE THE DANCER GOES TO LIE

WITH THE KING AND NEED NOT KNOW

HE WILL JILT HER BY AND BY.

WE WERE YOUNG ONCE AND ARE OLD;

HAVE SEEN THE DRAGON DIE BEFORE;

KNEW THE INNOCENT AND BOLD

SAW THEM THROUGH THE CARDBOARD DOOR

KISS THE GUILTY AND AFRAID

TURNING HUMAN SOON ENOUGH.

WE HAVE WEPT WITH THE BETRAYED

NEVER KNOWN THEM DIE FOR LOVE.

YET SINCE NOTHING’S DONE BY HALVES

WHILE ILLUSION’S YET TO DO

MAY WE STILL FORGIVE OURSELVES

AND DANCE AGAIN WHEN TRUMPETS BLOW.

VILLA ADRIANA

WHEN THE COLOSSUS OF THE WILL’S DOMINION

WAVERS AND SHRINKS UPON A DYING EYE

ENORMOUS SHADOWS SIT LIKE BIRDS OF PREY

WAITING TO FALL WHERE BLISTERED MARBLES LIE.

BUT IN ITS OPEN POOLS THE PLACE ALREADY

LAY RUINED BEFORE THE OLD KING LEFT IT FREE.

SHATTERED IN WATERS OF EACH MARBLE BASIN

HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT AS TODAY WE SEE.

DYING IN DISCONTENT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN

HOW ONCE MERE CONSCIOUSNESS HAD TURNED ITS BACK

THE FRESCOES OF HIS APPETITE WOULD CRUMBLE

THE FOUNTAINS OF HIS LONGING YAWN AND CRACK.

AND ALL HIS GENIUS WOULD BECOME A RIDDLE

HIS PERFECT COLONNADES AT LAST ATTAIN

THE INCOMPLETENESS OF A NATURAL THING;

HIS IMPULSE TURN TO MYSTERY AGAIN.

WHO SLEEPS AND DREAMS AND WAKES AND SLEEPS AGAIN

MAY DREAM AGAIN; SO IN THE END WE COME

BACK TO THE CHERISHED AND CONSUMING SCENE

AS IF FOR ONCE THE STONES WILL NOT BE DUMB.

WE COME LIKE DREAMERS SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER

PASSIONATELY IN NEED TO RECONSTRUCT

THE COLUMNED ROOFS UNDER THE BLAZING SKY

THE COURTS SO OPEN SO FOREVER LOCKED.

AND SOME OF US AS DREAMERS EXCAVATE

UNDER THE BLANCHING LIGHT OF SLEEP’S HIGH NOON

THE ARTIFACTS OF THOUGHT THE SITE OF LOVE

WHOSE HADRIAN HAS GIVEN THE SLIP AND GONE.

THE EXPLORERS

BESIDE THE MARE CRISIUM THAT SEA

WHERE WATER NEVER WAS SIT DOWN WITH ME

AND LET US TALK OF EARTH WHERE LONG AGO

WE DRANK THE AIR AND SAW THE RIVERS FLOW

LIKE COMETS THROUGH THE GREEN ESTATES OF MAN

AND FRUIT THE COLOUR OF ALDEBARAN

WEIGHTED THE CURVING BOUGHS. THE ROUTE OF STARS

WAS OUR DIVERSION AND THE FATE OF MARS

OUR GRAVE CONCERN; WE STARED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT

ON THESE UNCOLONIZED DEMESNES OF LIGHT.

WE READ OF STARS ESCAPING NEWTON’S CHAIN

TILL ONLY AUTOGRAPHS OF FIRE REMAIN;

WE AIMED OUR MORTAL SEARCHLIGHTS INTO SPACE

AS IF IN HOPES TO FIND A MORTAL FACE.

O LITTLE EARTH OUR VILLAGE WHERE THE DAY

SEEMED ALL TOO BRIEF AND STARLIGHT WOULD NOT STAY

WE WERE PROVINCIALS ON THE GRAND EXPRESS

THAT WHIRLED US INTO DARK AND LONELINESS.

WE THOUGHT TO BRING YOU WONDER WITH A TALE

HUGER THAN THOSE THAT TURNED OUR FATHERS PALE.

HERE IN THIS LUNAR NIGHT WE WATCH ALONE

LONGER THAN EVER MEN HAVE WATCHED FOR DAWN.

BEYOND THIS METEOR-BITTEN PLAIN WE SEE

MORE STARRY SYSTEMS THAN YOU DREAM TO BE

AND WHILE THEIR CLOCKWORK BLAZES OVERHEAD

WE SPEAK THE NAMES WE LEARNED AS WE WERE BRED

WE TELL OF PLACES SEEN EACH DAY FROM BIRTH—

OBSCURE AND LOCAL PATOIS OF THE EARTH!

O RACE OF FARMERS PLOWING YEAR BY YEAR

THE SAME FEW FIELDS I SOMETIMES SEEM TO HEAR

THE FAR-OFF ECHO OF A CATTLE-BELL

AGAINST THE CRATERED CLIFF OF ARZACHEL

AND WEEP TO THINK NO SOUND CAN EVER COME

ACROSS THAT OUTER DESERT FROM MY HOME.

LANDSCAPE OF THE STAR

THE SILENCE OF THE YEAR. THIS HOUR THE STREETS

LIE EMPTY AND THE CLASH OF BELLS IS SCATTERED

OUT TO THE EDGE OF STARS. I HEARD THEM TELL

MORNING’S FIRST CHANGE AND CLANG THE PEOPLE HOME

FROM CRÈCHE AND SCENTED AISLE. COME HOME COME HOME

I HEARD THE BELLS OF CHRISTMAS CALL AND DIE.

THIS CHRISTMAS MORNING IN THE STONY STREETS

OF AN UNACCUSTOMED CITY WHERE THE GAS

QUIVERS AGAINST THE DARKLY-SHUTTERED WALLS

I WALK MY BREATH A VEIL UPON THE COLD

NO LONGER SICK FOR HOME NOR HUNTED DOWN

BY FACES LOVED BY GATE OR SILL OR TREE

THAT ONCE I USED TO WREATHE IN RED AND SILVER

UNDER THE SPLINTERED INCENSE OF THE FIR.

I THINK OF THOSE INSCRUTABLES WHO TOILED

HEAVY AND BROODING IN THEIR CAMEL-TRAIN

ACROSS THE BLUE-WRAPPED STRETCHES. HOME BEHIND

KINGDOMS DEPARTED FROM THE SOLEMN JOURNEY

THEIR ONLY RESIDENCE: THE STARLIT HOUR

THE LANDSCAPE OF THE STAR THEIR TIME AND PLACE.

O TO BE ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THE SWAY

OF ROCKING CAMEL THROUGH THE JUDAEAN SAND—

RIDE WRAPPED IN SWATHES OF DAMASK AND OF SILK

HEAR THE FAINT RING OF JEWEL IN SILVER MESH

STARRING THE SILENCE OF THE PLAIN; AND HOLD

WITH RIGID FINGERS CURVED AS IN OBLATION

THE GOLDEN JAR OF MYRRH AGAINST THE KNEES.

TO RIDE THUS BEARING GIFTS TO A STRANGE LAND

TO A STRANGE KING; NOR THINK OF FEAR AND ENVY

BEING SO BEMUSED BY STARLIGHT OF ONE STAR

THE LONG UNBROKEN JOURNEY THAT ALL QUESTIONS

SINK LIKE THE LESSER LIGHTS BEHIND THE HILLS;

THINK NEITHER OF THE END IN SIGHT NOR ALL

THAT LIES BEHIND BUT DREAMLESSLY TO RIDE

TRAVELLER AT ONE WITH TRAVELLED COUNTRYSIDE.

HOW ELSE SINCE FOR THOSE MAGI AND THEIR TRAIN

THE PALACES BEHIND HAVE CEASED TO BE

HOME AND THE HOME THEY TRAVEL TOWARD IS STILL

BUT RUMOR STOKING FEAR IN HEROD’S BRAIN?

WHAT ELSE FOR THEM BUT THIS SINCE NEVER MORE

CAN COURTS AND STATES RECEIVE THEM AS THEY WERE

NOR HAVE THE TRAMPLED EARTH THE ROOF OF STRAW

RECEIVED THE KINGS AS THEY ARE YET TO BE?

THE BELLS ARE SILENT SILENCED IN MY MIND

AS ON THE DARK. I WALK A FOREIGNER

UPON THIS NIGHT THAT CALLS ALL TRAVELLERS HOME

THE PRODIGAL FORGIVEN AND THE BREACH

MENDED FOR THIS ONE FEAST. YET ALL ARE STRANGE

TO THEIR OWN ENDS AND THEIR BEGINNINGS NOW

CANNOT CONTAIN THEM. ONCE-FAMILIAR SPEECH

BABBLES IN WAYWARD DIALECT OF A DREAM.

OUR GIFTS SHALL BRING US HOME: NOT TO BEGINNINGS

NOR ALWAYS TO THE DESTINATION NAMED

UPON OUR SETTING-FORTH. OUR GIFTS COMPEL

MASTER OUR WAYS AND LEAD US IN THE END

WHERE WE ARE MOST OURSELVES; WHETHER AT LAST

TO SOLOMON’S GAZE OR SHEBA’S SILKEN KNEES

OR WINTER PASTURES UNDERNEATH A STAR

WHERE ANGELS SPRING LIKE STARLIGHT IN THE TREES.

LETTER FROM THE LAND
OF SINNERS

I WRITE YOU THIS OUT OF ANOTHER PROVINCE

THAT YOU MAY NEVER SEE:

COUNTRY OF RIVERS ITS TOPOGRAPHY

MUTABLE IN DETAIL YET ALWAYS ONE

BLASTED IN CERTAIN PLACES HERE BY GLACIERS

THERE BY THE WORK OF MAN.

THE FISHERS BY THE WATER HAVE NO BOAST

SAVE OF THEIR FREEDOM; HERE

A MAN MAY CAST A DOZEN KINDS OF LURE

AND THINK HIS DAYS REWARDED IF HE SIGHT

NOW AND AGAIN THE PRIZE UNNETTED FLICKING

ITS PRISM-GLEAMS OF LIGHT.

THE OLD LORD LIVED SECLUDED IN HIS PARK

UNTIL THE HALL WAS BURNED

YEARS AGO BY HIS TENANTS; BOTH HAVE LEARNED

BETTER SINCE THEN AND NOW OUR CHILDREN RUN

TO GREET HIM. QUAIL AND HUNTER HAVE FORGOTTEN

THE ECHO OF THE GUN.

I SAID THERE ARE BLASTED PLACES: WE HAVE KEPT

THEIR NAKEDNESS INTACT—

NO MARBLE TO COMMEMORATE AN ACT

SUPERHUMAN OR MERELY RASH; WE KNOW

WHY THEY ARE THERE AND WHY THE SEED THAT FALLS THERE

IS CERTAIN NOT TO GROW.

WE KEEP THESE PLACES AS WE KEEP THE TIME

SCARRED ON OUR RECOLLECTION

WHEN SOME WE LOVED BROKE FROM US IN DEFECTION

OR WE OURSELVES HARRIED TO DEATH TOO SOON

WHAT WE COULD LEAST FORGO. OUR MEMORIES

RECUR LIKE THE OLD MOON.

BUT WE HAVE MADE ANOTHER KIND OF PEACE

AND WALK WHERE BOUGHS ARE GREEN

FORGIVEN BY THE SELVES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

AND LEARNING TO FORGIVE. OUR APPLES TASTE

SWEETER THIS YEAR; OUR GATES ARE FALLING DOWN

AND NEED NOT BE REPLACED.

CONCORD RIVER

THE TURTLES ON THE LEDGES OF JULY

HEARD OUR APPROACH AND SPLASHED. NOW IN THE MUD

LIE LIKE THE MEMORY OF FECUND SUMMER

THEIR BURIED EGGS. THE RIVER COLDER NOW

HAS OTHER AUTUMN TALES TO CARRY ON

BETWEEN THE BANKS WHERE LOVERS USED TO LIE.

LOVERS OR BOYS ESCAPED FROM YARD AND FARM

TO DROWN IN SENSUAL PURITIES OF SUN—

NO MATTER WHICH; FOR SINGLE FISHERMAN

CASTING INTO THE SHADE OR THOSE ABSORBED

IN HUMAN ARDOR SUMMER WAS THE SAME

IMPERVIOUS TO WEARINESS OR ALARM.

THE FISHERMAN BY CRAFT AND LOVE REMOVED

FROM MEANNESS HAS AN ALMANAC AT HOME

SAYING THE SEASON WILL BE BRIEF THIS YEAR

AND ICE STRIKE EARLY; YET UPON ITS SHELF

THE BOOK IS NO DESPOILER OF THIS DAY

IN WHICH HE MOVES AND PONDERS MOST HIMSELF.

THAT BOY WATCHING FOR TURTLES BY THE SHORE

STEEPED IN HIS SATISFACTORY LONELINESS

IF ASKED COULD TELL US THAT THE SUN WOULD SET

OR AUTUMN DRIVE HIM BACK TO GAMES AND SCHOOL—

TELL US AT SECOND-HAND BELIEVING THEN

ONLY MIDSUMMER AND THE NOONSTRUCK POOL.

AND WE WHO FLOATED THROUGH THE SUNLIT GREEN

INDOLENT VOLUNTARY AS THE DANCE

OF DRAGON-FLIES ABOVE THE SKIMMING LEAVES—

FOR US THE LANDSCAPE AND THE HOUR BECAME

A SINGLE ELEMENT WHERE OUR DRIFTING SILENCE

FELL TWOFOLD LIKE OUR SHADOWS ON THE WATER.

THIS IS THE CONCORD RIVER WHERE THE ICE

WILL HOLD TILL APRIL: THIS IS THE WILLOWED STREAM

MUCH THREADED BY THE NATIVE COGITATORS

WHO WROTE THEIR JOURNALS CALMLY BY ITS SHORE

OBSERVING WEATHER AND THE SWING OF SEASONS

ALONG WITH PERSONAL COSMOLOGIES.

HENRY THOREAU MOST NEARLY LEARNED TO LIVE

WITHIN A WORLD HIS SOUL COULD RECOGNIZE—

UNSHAKEN BY ACCOUNTS OF ANY COUNTRY

HE COULD NOT TOUCH WITH BOTH HIS HANDS. HE SAW

THE RIVER MOVING PAST THE PROVINCIAL TOWN

AND KNEW EACH CURVE OF SHORELINE FOR HIS OWN.

HE TRAVELLED MUCH HE SAID—HIS WAYWARD SPEECH

SOUNDING ALWAYS A LITTLE INSOLENT

YET SURER THAN THE REST; THEY LIKE OURSELVES

RAN OFF TO DABBLE IN A WORLD BEYOND

WHILE HE EXALTED THE GEOGRAPHY

HE LIVED EACH DAY: A RIVER AND A POND.

FOR HIM THERE WAS NO TURNING OF THE EAR

TO RUMORED URGENCIES THAT SOUGHT TO ROUSE

THE FISHER FROM HIS POOL THE SERIOUS CHILD

FROM HIS UNCONSCIOUS WANDERING: THE SOUND

OF DESPERATE ENTERPRISES RANG TO HIM

FICTIVE AS GHOSTS UPON OLD INDIAN GROUND.

LOVER AND CHILD AND FISHERMAN ALIKE

HAVE IN THEIR TIME BEEN NATIVE TO THIS SHORE

AS HE WOULD HAVE IT PEOPLED: ALL ENTRANCED

BY SUCH CONCERNS IN THEIR PERFECTED HOUR

THAT IN THEIR LIVES THE RIVER AND THE TREE

ARE ABSOLUTES NO LONGER SCENERY.

APOLOGY

YOU INVINCIBLY YOURSELF

HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.

THE STONES UPON THE MOUNTAINSIDE

ARE NOT MORE FREE

BEARING ALL QUESTION ALL REPROACH

WITHOUT REPLY.

THE DEAD WHO KEEP THEIR PEACE INTACT

ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW

MUCH WE MIGHT BE GAINERS BY

ARE PROUD LIKE YOU—

OR IF THEY SPOKE MIGHT SOUND AS YOU

SOUNDED JUST NOW.

FOR EVERY ANGRY SIMPLE MAN

THE WORD IS BUT

A SHADOW AND HIS MOTIVE GROWS

MORE STILL AND GREAT

WHILE THE WORLD HUMS AROUND HIM WILD

THAT HE SHOULD EXPLICATE.

AND SOCRATES WHOSE CRYSTAL TONGUE

PERTURBS US NOW

LEFT ALL UNSATISFIED; THE WORD

CAN NEVER SHOW

REASON ENOUGH FOR WHAT A MAN

KNOWS HE MUST DO.

YOU TOLD US LITTLE AND ARE DONE.

SO MIGHT THE DEAD

BEGIN TO SPEAK OF DYING THEN

LEAVE HALF UNSAID.

SILENCE LIKE THUNDER BEARS ITS OWN

EXCUSE FOR DREAD.

LIVING IN SIN

SHE HAD THOUGHT THE STUDIO WOULD KEEP ITSELF;

NO DUST UPON THE FURNITURE OF LOVE.

HALF HERESY TO WISH THE TAPS LESS VOCAL

THE PANES RELIEVED OF GRIME. A PLATE OF PEARS

A PIANO WITH A PERSIAN SHAWL A CAT

STALKING THE PICTURESQUE AMUSING MOUSE

HAD RISEN AT HIS URGING.

NOT THAT AT FIVE EACH SEPARATE STAIR WOULD WRITHE

UNDER THE MILKMAN’S TRAMP; THAT MORNING LIGHT

SO COLDLY WOULD DELINEATE THE SCRAPS

OF LAST NIGHT’S CHEESE AND THREE SEPULCHRAL BOTTLES;

THAT ON THE KITCHEN SHELF AMONG THE SAUCERS

A PAIR OF BEETLE-EYES WOULD FIX HER OWN—

ENVOY FROM SOME VILLAGE IN THE MOLDINGS …

MEANWHILE HE WITH A YAWN

SOUNDED A DOZEN NOTES UPON THE KEYBOARD

DECLARED IT OUT OF TUNE SHRUGGED AT THE MIRROR

RUBBED AT HIS BEARD WENT OUT FOR CIGARETTES;

WHILE SHE JEERED BY THE MINOR DEMONS

PULLED BACK THE SHEETS AND MADE THE BED AND FOUND

A TOWEL TO DUST THE TABLE-TOP

AND LET THE COFFEE-POT BOIL OVER ON THE STOVE.

BY EVENING SHE WAS BACK IN LOVE AGAIN

THOUGH NOT SO WHOLLY BUT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT

SHE WOKE SOMETIMES TO FEEL THE DAYLIGHT COMING

LIKE A RELENTLESS MILKMAN UP THE STAIRS.

AUTUMN EQUINOX

THE LEAVES THAT SHIFTED OVERHEAD ALL SUMMER

ARE MARKED FOR EARTH NOW AND I BRING THE BASKETS

STILL DARK WITH CLINGINGS OF ANOTHER SEASON

UP FROM THE CELLAR. ALL THE HOUSE IS STILL

NOW THAT I’VE LEFT IT. LYMAN IN HIS STUDY

PEERS ON A PAGE OF DRYDEN BY THE WINDOW

EYES ALONE MOVING LIKE A MENDED QUAINT

PIECE OF OLD CLOCKWORK. WHEN THE AFTERNOON

TRAILS INTO HALF-LIGHT HE WILL NEVER NOTICE

UNTIL I COME INDOORS TO LIGHT THE LAMPS

AND ROUSE HIM BLINKING FROM THE BROWNISH TYPE

THE GILT AND TARNISHED SPINE OF VOLUME FIVE

OUT OF THE GLASS-DOORED CABINET IN THE HALL.

WHY SATIRES I HAVE WONDERED? FOR I’VE SEEN

THE TITLE-PAGE AND RIFFLED THROUGH THE VOLUME

WHEN HE WAS GONE. I THOUGHT THAT GROWING OLD

RETURNED ONE TO A VAGUE ARCADIAN LONGING

TO OVID SPENSER SOMETHING GOLDEN-AGED

SOME INCORRUPTIBLE MYTH THAT TINGED THE YEARS

WITH PASTORAL FLAVOURS. LYMAN TOO AS GENTLE

AS AN OLD SHEPHERD HALF-APOLOGETIC

WHEN I COME BUSTLING TO DISTURB HIS DREAMS—

WHAT IN THAT BITTERNESS CAN SPEAK TO HIM

OR HELP HIM DOWN THESE FINAL SLOPING DECADES

WITH KINDLY ARM? I’VE NEVER BEEN A SCHOLAR—

READER PERHAPS AT TIMES BUT NOT A SCHOLAR

NOT IN THE WAY THAT LYMAN USED TO BE—

AND YET I KNOW THERE’S ACID ON THE PAGE

HE PORES—THAT LEAST ACIDULOUS OF MEN.

WHILE I WHO SPENT MY YOUTH AND MIDDLE-AGE

IN STUBBORNNESS AND RAILING PASS THE TIME

NOW AFTER FIFTY RAKING IN THE SUN

THE LEAVES THAT SPRINKLE SLOWLY ON THE GRASS

AND FEEL THEIR GOLD LIKE FIRELIGHT AT MY BACK

IN SLOW PREOCCUPATION WITH SEPTEMBER.

SOMETIMES I CALL ACROSS TO ALICE HUME

AND MEET HER AT THE FENCE AS WOMEN MEET

TO SAY THE WEATHER’S SEASONABLY FINE

TALK HUSBANDS BARGAINS OR PHILOSOPHIZE—

THE DRY PHILOSOPHY OF NEIGHBORHOOD.

SHE THINKS PERHAPS HOW SHARP OF TONGUE AND QUICK

I USED TO BE AND HOW I’VE QUIETED DOWN

WITHOUT THOSE AIRS BECAUSE I’D MARRIED LYMAN

PROFESSOR AT THE COLLEGE WHILE HER HUSBAND

WAS JUST ANOTHER FARMER. THAT WAS PRIDE

AS RAW AND SILLY AS THE GIRL I WAS—

READING TOO MUCH SNEERING AT OTHER GIRLS

WHOSE LEARNING WAS OF COOKERY AND FLIRTATION.

FATHER WOULD HAVE ME CLEVER SOMETIMES SAID

HE’D LET ME TRAIN FOR MEDICINE LIKE A SON

TO COME INTO HIS PRACTICE. SO I STUDIED

GERMAN AND BOTANY AND HATED BOTH.

WHAT GOOD FOR ME TO KNOW THE LATIN NAME

FOR HUCKLEBERRY WHILE THE OTHERS CLIMBED

TO PICK THE FRUIT AND KISSED ACROSS THE BUSHES?

I NEVER WAS A SCHOLAR BUT I HAD

A WOMAN’S LOVE FOR MEN OF INTELLECT

A WOMAN’S NEED FOR LOVE OF ANY KIND.

SO LYMAN CAME TO ASK ME OF MY FATHER:

STIFF-COLLARED SHY NOT QUITE THE MAN I’D DREAMED—

(BYRON AND MATTHEW ARNOLD VAGUELY MINGLED

WITHOUT THE DISADVANTAGES OF EITHER.)

AND YET HE SEEMED SUPERB IN HIS REFUSAL

TO READ ALOUD FROM BRYANT TO THE LADIES

ASSEMBLED ON THE BOARDING-HOUSE PIAZZA

AMONG THE MOTH-WINGS OF A SUMMER EVENING.

HIS QUICK WITHDRAWAL WON MY HEART. I SMILE

SOMETIMES TO THINK WHAT QUIRKS OF VANITY

PROPEL US TOWARD OUR CHOICES IN THE END.

THE WEDDING-PICTURE IN THE BUREAU DRAWER

HAS ON THE BACK IN LYMAN’S MEASURED WRITING:

“SEPTEMBER TWENTY-SECOND NINETEEN-TWELVE.”

I KEEP IT IN ITS FOLDER DECKLE-EDGED

AND YELLOWING. I SEE MYSELF AGAIN

CORRECT AND TERRIFIED ON OUR WEDDING-DAY

WEARING THE LACE MY MOTHER WORE BEFORE ME

AND BUTTONED SHOES THAT PINCHED. I FEEL AGAIN

THE TREMBLING OF MY HAND IN LYMAN’S FINGERS

AWKWARDLY HELD IN THAT UNGAINLY POSE

WHILE AUNTS AROUND US NODDED LIKE THE FATES

THAT NEMESIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED. LYMAN STOOD

SO THIN AND MINISTERIAL IN HIS BLACK

I THOUGHT HE LOOKED A STRANGER. IN THE PICTURE

WE ARE THE SEMBLANCE OF A BRIDE AND GROOM

STATIC AS FIGURES ON A MANTELPIECE

AS IF THAT MOMENT OUT OF TIME EXISTED

THEN AND FOREVER IN A DOME OF GLASS

WHERE NEITHER DUST NOR THE EXPLORING FLY

COULD SPECK ITS DRY IMMUTABILITY.

THUS I BECAME HIS PARTNER IN A LIFE

ANNUAL ACADEMIC; WE OBSERVED

EVENTS MOMENTOUS AS THE CEREMONY

TO DEDICATE THE CHAPEL CARILLON

(MEMORIAL TO EDWARD STEPHENS HODGE

CLASS OF NINETEEN-FOURTEEN). THERE WE HEARD

THOSE SOUNDS CONVERGE UPON THE RURAL AIR

THAT SOON BECAME FAMILIAR AS A HINGE

CREAKING AND NEVER SILENCED. IN OUR MEADOW

THE ANGULAR YOUNG TOOK UP THEIR BATS AND SHOUTED

THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON WHILE I WAS POURING

TEA FOR THE DEAN’S ARTHRITIC WIFE. FOR LYMAN

THE WORLD WAS ALL THE DISTANCE HE PURSUED

FROM HOME TO LECTURE-ROOM AND HOME AGAIN

EXCHANGING NODS WITH COLLEAGUES SMILING VAGUELY

UPON A SHIRTSLEEVED TRIO TANNED AND JOSTLING

WHO GRINNED AND GAVE HIM ROOM UPON THE PATH.

I BIT MY FINGERS CHANGED THE PARLOR CURTAINS

TO ONES THE LIKE OF WHICH WERE NEVER SEEN

ALONG OUR GRAVE AND ACADEMIC STREET.

I BROUGHT THEM HOME FROM SPRINGFIELD IN A BUNDLE

AND HUNG THEM IN DEFIANCE. I TOOK A WALK

ACROSS THE FIELDS ONE HEAVY SUMMER NIGHT

UNTIL THE COLLEGE FROM A MILE AWAY

LOOKED SALLOW INSIGNIFICANT IN THE MOONLIGHT.

IT SEEMED THE MOON MUST SHINE ON FINER THINGS

I HAD NOT SEEN THINGS THAT COULD SHOW WITH PRIDE

BENEATH THAT SILVER GLOBE. ALONG THE WALLS

OF LYMAN’S STUDY THERE WERE STEEL ENGRAVINGS

FRAMED IN BLACK OAK: THE CRAZY TOWER OF PISA

THE PYRAMIDS ROOTED IN DESERT SAND

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL WITH ITS DANGEROUS SPIRES

PIERCING THE ATMOSPHERE. I HATED THEM

FOR PRIGGISHLY ENCLOSING IN A ROOM

THE MARVELS OF THE WORLD AS IF DECLARING

SUCH WAS THE RIGHT AND FITTING RÔLE OF MARVELS.

NIGHT AND I WEPT ALOUD; HALF IN MY SLEEP

HALF FEELING LYMAN’S WONDER AS HE LEANED

ABOVE TO SHAKE ME. “ARE YOU ILL UNHAPPY?

TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO.”

“I’M SICK I GUESS—

I THOUGHT THAT LIFE WAS DIFFERENT THAN IT IS.”

“TELL ME WHAT’S WRONG. WHY CAN’T YOU EVER SAY?

I’M HERE YOU KNOW.”

HALF SHAMED I TURNED TO SEE

THE LINES OF GRIEVOUS LOVE UPON HIS FACE

THE LOVE THAT GROPES AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

“I MUST BE CRAZY LYMAN—OR A DREAM

HAS MADE ME BABBLE THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT.

GO BACK TO SLEEP—I WON’T BE SO AGAIN.”

YOUNG LOVERS TALK OF GIVING ALL THE HEART

INTO EACH OTHERS’ TRUST: THEIR RHETORIC

WON’T STAND FOR ANALYZING I’M AWARE

BUT HAVE THEY THOUGHT OF THIS: THAT EACH MUST KNOW

BEYOND A DOUBT WHAT’S GIVEN WHAT RECEIVED?

NOW WE ARE OLD LIKE NATURE; PATIENT STAID

UNHURRIED FROM THE YEAR’S WELLWORN ROUTINE

WE WAKE AND TAKE THE DAY FOR WHAT IT IS

AND SLEEP AS CALMLY AS THE DEAD WHO KNOW

THEY’LL WAKE TO THEIR REWARD. WE HAVE BECOME

AS UNSELFCONSCIOUS AS A PAIR OF TREES

NOT QUESTIONING BUT LIVING. EVEN AUTUMN

CAN ONLY CARRY THROUGH WHAT SPRING BEGAN.

WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN NOW BUT LOSS OF LEAF

AND RAIN UPON THE BOUGHS? SO I HAVE THOUGHT

AND WONDERED FAINTLY WHERE THE THOUGHT BEGAN

AND WHEN THE IRRITABLE GUST OF YOUTH

STOPPED TURNING EVERY BLADE OF GRASS TO FIND

A NEW DISSATISFACTION. MEANWHILE LYMAN

READS SATIRE IN THE FALLING AFTERNOON—

A CHANGE FOR HIM AS WELL. WE FINISH OFF

NOT QUITE AS WE BEGAN. I HEAR THE BELLS

WANDERING THROUGH THE AIR ACROSS THE FIELDS.

I’VE RAKED THREE BUSHEL BASKETS FULL OF LEAVES—

ENOUGH FOR ONE SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON.

THE STRAYED VILLAGE

HE HAD COME NEARLY HALF A THOUSAND MILES

AND THEN TO FIND IT GONE … HE KNEW TOO WELL

EVER TO BE MISTAKEN WHERE THE HILLS

DIPPED TO REVEAL IT FIRST: THE LINE OF CHIMNEYS

REFLECTED IN THE UNIMPORTANT STREAM

THE MONUMENT WORTH HALF A LINE IN GUIDEBOOKS—

“TOWER OF A CHURCH THAT CROMWELL’S ARMY BURNED

FINE EARLY PERPENDICULAR”—ITSELF

SUBSERVIENT NEITHER TO THEOLOGIES

NOR CHANGING STYLES OF ARCHITECTURE STILL

A CIPHER ON THE LANDSCAPE SOMETHING CLEAR

IN THAT UNOSTENTATIOUS SCENERY.

WELL IF THE TOWER WAS GONE—AND WHO SHOULD SAY

DEPEND ON ANY LANDMARK TO REMAIN?

HE HAD BEEN TOO FAR AND KNOWN TOO MANY LOSSES

NOT TO BE RECONCILED THAT EVEN LANDMARKS

GO OUT LIKE MATCHES WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST.

SO IT COULD BE WITH THIS. BUT NOT A HOUSE

NOT ANYTHING REFLECTED IN THE RIVER

BUT WILLOWS THAT COULD GROW BY ANY RIVER

FEMININE NON-COMMITTAL IN THEIR POSTURES.

WILLOWS: A BRIDGE THEN? BUT THE BRIDGE WAS GONE

THE PILES HAD LEFT NO TRACE NO SIGNATURE

OF STONES BESIDE THE WATER. IF INDEED

THERE EVER HAD BEEN BRIDGE OR TOWER OR HOUSE.

THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT ENFOREIGNED HIM

BRUSHED FORTY YEARS OF MEMORY ASIDE

AND MADE OF HIM ANOTHER OBTUSE TRIPPER

STARING AT SIGNPOSTS TO BE REASSURED:

THIS IS THE PLACE—WHERE I GREW INTO MANHOOD

THE PLACE I HAD TO LEAVE WHEN I WAS GROWN?

SO OFTEN HE HAD THOUGHT A MAN’S WHOLE LIFE

MOST RIGHTLY COULD BE WRITTEN LIKE HIS OWN

IN TERMS OF PLACES HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE

BECAUSE THEIR MEANING PASSING THAT OF PERSONS

BECAME TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

“THIS IS THE PLACE?”

HE HEARD HIMSELF DEMAND; AND HEARD THE OTHER—

A YOUTHFUL RECTOR BY THE LOOK OF HIM

PAUSING UPON HIS EVENING STROLL—REPLY

“OH YES THIS IS THE PLACE…. THE VILLAGE WENT

AS I SHOULD RECKON TWENTY YEARS AGO.

ACROSS THE HILL IN OUR TOWN THERE WAS ONCE

TALK AND CONJECTURE; NOW YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE

ONLY THE ANTIQUARIANS BREATHE ITS NAME.

THE MEMORY OF MAN MY FRIEND IS SHORT.”

“SHORTER AND LONGER THAN IT’S CREDITED”

HE ANSWERED; “BUT YOU SAY THE VILLAGE WENT?

I HARDLY CARE TO ASK AND YET I ASK—

BY FLOOD? BY FIRE? THERE USED TO BE A TOWER

THAT CROMWELL’S ZEALOTS FAILED TO BULLY DOWN.

BUT THERE’S NO MARK. IT WENT? HOW DID IT GO?”

“IT WENT AWAY. YOU’VE HEARD OF MEN WHO WENT

SUDDENLY WITHOUT PARTINGS OR ANNULMENTS

NOT CARRIED OFF BY ACCIDENT OR DEATH

BUT SIMPLY STRAYED? THAT WAS THE WAY IT WENT.

WE WENT TO BED ON THURSDAY AND COULD HEAR

THE BELLS AS USUAL ON A QUIET NIGHT

ACROSS THE HILL BETWEEN. ON FRIDAY MORNING

THERE WERE NO BELLS. THERE WASN’T ANYTHING.

THE LANDSCAPE STOOD AS IF SINCE MAGNA CARTA

EMPTY AS IT STANDS NOW. THE VILLAGE HAD GONE

QUITE WITHOUT TAKING LEAVE. STRAYED IS THE WORD

WE FOUND OURSELVES AS IF BY ACQUIESCENCE

USING TO SPEAK OF IT AS IF WE THOUGHT

SOMEDAY TO COME UPON IT SOMEWHERE ELSE

AND GREET OUR FORMER NEIGHBORS AS BEFORE.

NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND IT THOUGH. ONE CAN’T

ADVERTISE FOR A VILLAGE THAT HAS STRAYED:

‘LOST WITH ONE EARLY PERPENDICULAR TOWER

A VILLAGE NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED SOULS

WITH STONE AND WOODEN FOOTBRIDGE.’ AND AS I SAY

MEN’S MEMORIES GROW SHORT LIKE WINTER DAYLIGHT.

SO MUCH GETS STRAYED THAT HAS TO BE REPLACED—

DOGS WITS AFFECTIONS …”

“YES SO MUCH GETS STRAYED;

BUT ONE OF ALL THE THINGS A MAN CAN LOSE

I THOUGHT WOULD KEEP TILL I COULD COME AGAIN.

IT ALMOST SEEMS IT WENT LEST I SHOULD COME

BECAUSE I ALWAYS PROMISED I WOULD COME

AND HAD THIS LATEST PENALTY IN STORE

THE LAST OF LOSSES.”

SO HE SAID GOODBYE

AND WATCHED THE LITTLE RECTOR CLIMB THE HILL

BACK TO HIS PARISH TOWN. THE STREAM RAN ON

AND ALL THAT WALKING WAS TO DO AGAIN.

THE PERENNIAL ANSWER

THE WAY THE WORLD CAME SWINGING ROUND MY EARS

I KNEW WHAT DOCTOR MEANT THE DAY HE SAID

“TAKE CARE UNLESS YOU WANT TO JOIN YOUR DEAD;

IT’S TIME TO END THIS BATTLING WITH YOUR YEARS.”

HE KNEW I’D HAVE THE BLACKEST WORD TOLD STRAIGHT

WHETHER IT WAS MY CHILD THAT COULDN’T LIVE

OR JOEL’S MIND THICK-RIDDLED LIKE A SIEVE

WITH ALL THAT LOVING FESTERED INTO HATE.

BETTER TO KNOW THE WAYS YOU ARE ACCURST

AND STAND UP FIERCE AND GLAD TO HEAR THE WORST.

THE BLOOD IS CHARGED THE BACK IS STIFFENED SO.

WELL ON THAT DAY THAT WAS A DAY AGO

AND YET SO MANY HOURS AND YEARS AGO

NUMBERED IN SEIZURES OF A DARKENING BRAIN

I STARTED UP THE ATTIC STAIRS AGAIN—

THE FIFTH TIME IN THE HOUR—NOT THINKING THEN

THAT IT WAS HOT BUT KNOWING THE AIR SAT STILLER

UNDER THE EAVES THAN WHEN THE IDIOT KILLER

HID IN THE MATTHEWS BARN AMONG THE HAY

AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS THROUGH ONE AUGUST DAY

WAITED OUTSIDE WITH PITCHFORKS IN THE SUN.

JOEL WAITED TOO AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE GUN

RESOUND SO FLATLY IN THE LOFT ABOVE

HE WAS THE ONE TO GIVE THE DOOR A SHOVE

AND CLIMB THE LADDER. A MAN NOT MADE FOR LOVE

BUT BUILT FOR THINGS OF VIOLENCE; HE WOULD STAND

WHERE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND WATCH WITH EYES SO WIDE

YOU THOUGHT THE PRONGS OF FIRE WOULD STRIKE INSIDE;

OR SIT WITH SOME DECAYING BOOK IN HAND

READING OF SPIRITS AND THE EVIL-EYED

AND WITCHES’ SABBATHS IN A POISONED LAND.

SO IT WAS JOEL THAT BROUGHT THE FELLOW OUT

TARNISHED WITH HAY AND BLOOD. I STILL CAN SEE

THE EYES THAT JOEL TURNED AND FIXED ON ME

WHEN IT WAS DONE—AS IF BY RIGHTS HIS WIFE

SHOULD GO TO HIM FOR HAVING RISKED HIS LIFE

AND SAY—I HARDLY KNEW WHAT THING HE WANTED.

I KNOW IT WAS A THING I NEVER GRANTED

AND WHAT HIS MIND BECAME FROM ALL THAT WOE

THOSE VIOLENT CONCERNS HE LIVED AMONG

WAS ON MY HEAD AS WELL. I COULDN’T GO

I NEVER WENT TO HIM I NEVER CLUNG

ONE MOMENT ON HIS BREAST. BUT I WAS YOUNG.

AND I WAS CRUEL A GIRL-BRIDE SEEING ONLY

HER MARRIAGE AS A ROOM SO STRANGE AND LONELY

SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE FOR WARMTH. AND IN WHAT FASHION

COULD I BE VESSEL FOR THAT SOMBER PASSION—

FOR JOEL DECREED TILL DEATH TO HAVE ME ALL?

THE TORTURED GRANDSIRE HANGING IN THE HALL

DEPICTED BY A LIMNER’S CRABBED HAND

SEEMED MORE A BEING THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND.

HOW COULD I HELP BUT LOOK BEYOND THAT WALL

AND PROBE THE LAWFUL STONES THAT BUILT IT STRONG

WITH QUESTIONS SHARPER THAN A PITCHFORK’S PRONG?

IF JOEL KNEW HE KEPT HIS SILENCE LONG.

BUT EVANS AND I WERE HOPELESS FROM THE START:

HE COLLARED EARLY BY A RIGOROUS CREED

NOT MAN OF MEN BUT MAN OF GOD INDEED

WHOSE EYE HAD SEEN DAMNATION AND WHOSE HEART

THRUST ALL IT KNEW OF PASSION INTO ONE

CHAMBER OF IRON INSCRIBED THY WILL BE DONE.

YET SENSE WILL HAVE REVENGE ON ONE WHO TRIES

TO DOWN HIS SENSES WITH THE BRAND OF LIES.

THE ROAD WAS EMPTY FROM THE VILLAGE HOME

EMPTY OF ALL BUT US AND THAT DARK THIRD

THE SUDDEN NORTHERN SPRING. THERE MUST BE SOME

FOR WHOM THE THRUSTING BLOOD SO LONG DEFERRED

IN ALDER-STEM AND ELM IS NOT THE RISE

OF FLOOD IN THEIR OWN VEINS; SOME WHO CAN SEE

THAT GREEN UNHOLY DANCE WITHOUT SURPRISE.

I ONLY SAY IT HAS BEEN THIS FOR ME:

THE TIME OF THINNEST ICE OF CASUALTY

MORE SWIFT AND DEADLY THAN THE SKATER’S DANGER.

THE END OF MARCH COULD MAKE ME STAND A STRANGER

ON MY OWN DOORSTEP AND THE DAILY SHAPES

OF TEAPOT LADLE OR THE CHINA GRAPES

I KEPT IN WINTER ON THE DRESSER SHELF

REBUKED ME MADE ME FOREIGN TO MYSELF.

EVANS BESIDE ME ON THAT MOONLESS ROAD

WALKED HARD AS IF HE THOUGHT BEHIND US STRODE

PURSUERS HE HAD FLED THROUGH WEARY WAYS.

HE ONLY SAID: “WHERE I WAS BORN AND GREW

YOU FELT THE SPRING COME ON YOU LIKE A DAZE

SLOW OUT OF FEBRUARY AND YOU KNEW

THE THING YOU WERE CONTENDING WITH. BUT HERE—”

“SPRING IS A BOLT OF LIGHTNING ON THE YEAR”

I SAID “IT STRIKES BEFORE YOU FEEL IT NEAR.”

“THE CHANGE OF SEASONS IS ANOTHER THING

GOD PUT ON EARTH TO TRY US I BELIEVE.

AS IF THE BREAKING-OUT OF GREEN COULD BRING

ESCAPE FROM FROZEN DISCIPLINE GIVE US LEAVE

TO TASTE OF THINGS BY WILL AND LAW FORBIDDEN.”

“MAYBE IT WAS THE WEATHER LOST US EDEN”

I SAID BUT FALTERING AND THE WORDS WENT BY

LIKE FLIGHTS OF MOTHS UNDER THAT STAR-SOAKED SKY.

AND THAT WAS ALL. HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR;

THE HOUSE WAS DARK BUT ON THE UPPER FLOOR

A LIGHT BURNED IN THE HALLWAY. “JOEL’S ASLEEP”

I TOLD HIM AND PUT OUT MY HAND. HIS TOUCH

WAS COLD AS CANDLES KEPT UNLIT IN CHURCH

AND YET I FELT HIS SEEKING FINGERS CREEP

ABOUT MY WRIST AND SEIZE IT IN THEIR GRIP

UNTIL THEY HURT ME.

“NEITHER YOU NOR I

HAVE LIVED IN EDEN BUT THEY SAY WE DIE

TO GAIN THAT DAY AT LAST. WE HAVE TO LIVE

BELIEVING IT—WHAT ELSE CAN WE BELIEVE?”

“WHY NOT BELIEVE IN LIFE?” I SAID BUT HEARD

ONLY THE SANCTIONED AUTOMATIC WORD

“ETERNAL LIFE—” PERENNIAL ANSWER GIVEN

TO THOSE WHO ASK ON EARTH A TASTE OF HEAVEN.

THE PENALTY YOU PAY FOR DYING LAST

IS FACING THOSE TRANSACTIONS FROM THE PAST

THAT WOULD DETAIN YOU WHEN YOU TRY TO GO.

ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT I LAY AND SEEMED TO HEAR

THE TO-AND-FRO OF CALLERS DOWN BELOW

EVEN THE KNOCKER RATTLING ON THE DOOR.

I THOUGHT THE DEAD HAD HEARD MY TIME WAS NEAR

TO MEET THEM AND HAD COME TO TELL ME SO;

BUT NOT A FOOTSTEP SOUNDED ON THE STAIR.

IF THEY ARE GONE IT MEANS A FEW DAYS MORE

ARE LEFT OR THEY WOULD WAIT. JOEL WOULD WAIT

DOWN BY THE DARK OLD CLOCK THAT TOLD ME LATE

THAT NIGHT FROM BOSTON. “EVANS WALKED ME HOME;

WE SAT TOGETHER IN THE TRAIN BY CHANCE.”

BUT NOT A WORD; ONLY HIS BURNING GLANCE.

“WE STOPPED TO HAVE SOME COFFEE IN THE STATION.

WHY DO YOU STAND LIKE THAT? WHAT IF I COME

AN HOUR OR SO AFTER THE TIME I SAID?

THE HOUSE ALL DARK I THOUGHT YOU’D GONE TO BED.”

BUT STILL THAT GAZE NOT ANGER INDIGNATION

NOR ANYTHING SO EASY BUT A LOOK

AS FIXED AS WHEN HE STARED UPON HIS BOOK.

NO MATTER IF MY TALE WAS FALSE OR TRUE

I WAS A WOODCUT FIGURE ON THE PAGE

ON TRIAL FOR A NAMELESS SIN. THEN RAGE

TOOK HIM LIKE FIRE WHERE LIGHTNING DIVES. I KNEW

THAT HE COULD KILL ME THEN BUT WHAT HE DID

WAS WRENCH ME UP THE STAIRS ONTO THE BED.

THE NIGHT OF JOEL’S DEATH I SLEPT ALONE

IN THIS SAME ROOM. A NEIGHBOR SAID SHE’D STAY

THINKING THE DEAD MAN LYING DOWN BELOW

MIGHT KEEP THE LIVING FROM REST. SHE TOLD ME SO:

“THOSE HOURS BEFORE THE DAWN CAN LIE LIKE STONE

UPON THE HEART—I’VE LAIN AWAKE—I KNOW.”

AT LAST I HAD TO TAKE THE ONLY WAY

AND SAID “THE NIGHTS HE WAS ALIVE AND WALKING

FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND HEARING SPIRITS TALKING

WHAT SLEEP I HAD WAS LIKELIER TO BE BROKEN.”

HER FACE WAS SHOCKED BUT I WAS GLAD I’D SPOKEN.

“WELL IF YOU FEEL SO—:” SHE WOULD TELL THE TALE

NEXT MORNING BUT AT LAST I WAS ALONE

IN AN EXISTENCE FINALLY MY OWN.

AND YET I KNEW THAT EVANS WOULD FIND REASON

WHY WE WERE NOT OUR OWN NOR HAD OUR WILL

UNHINDERED; THAT DISTURBANCE OF A SEASON

SO LONG REMOVED WAS SOMETHING HE WOULD KILL

YET IF HE HAD NOT KILLED IT. WHEN I STOOD

BESIDE THE CHURCHYARD FENCE AND FELT HIS GLANCE

RELUCTANTLY COMPELLING MINE THE BLOOD

SOARED TO MY FACE THE TOMBSTONES SEEMED TO DANCE

DIZZILY TILL I TURNED. THE EYES I MET

ACCUSED AS THEY IMPLORED ME TO FORGET

AS IF MY SHAPE HAD RISEN TO DESTROY

SALVATION’S RAMPART WITH A HOPE OF JOY.

MY LIPS BETRAYED THEIR WHY? BUT THEN HIS FACE

TURNED FROM ME AND I SAW HIM LEAVE THE PLACE.

NOW JOEL AND EVANS ARE NEIGHBORS DOWN BENEATH.

I WONDER WHAT WE’RE BOUND TO AFTER DEATH?

I WONDER WHAT’S EXACTED OF THE DEAD

HOW MANY DEBTS OF CONSCIENCE STILL ARE GOOD?

NOT EVANS OR HIS BIBLE EVER SAID

THAT SPIRIT MUST COMPLETE WHAT FLESH AND BLOOD

CONTRACTED IN THEIR TERM. WHAT CREDITORS

WILL WAIT AND KNOCK FOR US AT MARBLE DOORS?

I’D LIKE TO KNOW WHICH STAYS WHEN LIFE IS PAST:

THE MARRIAGE KEPT IN FEAR THE LOVE DEFERRED

THE FOOTSTEP WAITED FOR AND NEVER HEARD

THE PRESSURE OF FIVE FINGERS ROUND THE WRIST

STOPPING ITS BEAT WITH PAIN THE MOUTH UNKISSED

THE DREAM WHOSE WAKING STARTLES INTO SIGHT

A FIGURE MUMBLING BY THE BED AT NIGHT

THE HOPELESS PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE—

TAKE NOW YOUR SCRIPTURE EVANS IF YOU WILL

AND SEE HOW FLIMSILY THE PAGES SPILL

FROM SPINES REDUCED TO DUST. WHAT HAVE THEY SAID

OF US TO WHAT WILL THEY PRONOUNCE ME WIFE?

MY DEBT IS PAID: THE REST IS ON YOUR HEAD.

THE INSOMNIACS

THE MYSTIC FINISHES IN TIME

THE ACTOR FINDS HIMSELF IN SPACE;

AND EACH WHEREVER HE HAS BEEN

MUST KNOW HIS HAND BEFORE HIS FACE

MUST CRAWL BACK INTO HIS OWN SKIN

AS IN THE DARKNESS AFTER CRIME

THE THIEF CAN HEAR HIS BREATH AGAIN

RESUME THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LIMBS

AND HOW THE SPASM GOES AND COMES

UNDER THE BONES THAT CAGE HIS HEART.

SO: WE ARE FAIRLY MET GRAVE FRIEND—

THE MEETING OF TWO WOUNDS IN MAN.

I GESTURING WITH PRACTICED HAND

I IN MY GREAT BROCADED GOWN

AND YOU THE FIXED AND PATIENT ONE

ENDURING ALL THE WORLD CAN DO.

I WITH MY SHIFTING MASKS THE GOLD

THE AWFUL SCARLET LAUGHING BLUE

MAKER OF MANY WORLDS; AND YOU

WORLDLESS THE PURE RECEPTACLE.

AND YET YOUR FLOATING EYES REVEAL

WHAT SAINT OR MUMMER GROANS TO FEEL:

THAT FINITE CREATURES FINALLY KNOW

THE DAMP OF STONE BENEATH THE KNEES

THE STIFFNESS IN THE FOLDED HANDS

A DULLER ACHE THAN HOLY WOUNDS

THE DRAUGHT THAT NEVER STIRS THE SLEEVE

OF GLAZED EVANGELISTS ABOVE

BUT DRIVES MEN OUT FROM SACRED CALM

INTO THE VIOLENT WAYWARD SUN.

MY VOICE COMMANDS THE FORMAL STAGE;

A JUNGLE THRIVES BEYOND THE WINGS—

ALL FORMLESS AND BENIGHTED THINGS

THAT RHETORIC CANNOT ASSUAGE.

I SPEAK A DREAM AND TURN TO SEE

THE SLEEPNESS NIGHT OUTSTARING ME.

MY PILLOW SWEATS; I WAKE IN SPACE.

THIS IS MY HAND BEFORE MY FACE.

THIS IS THE HEADBOARD OF MY BED

WHOSE SPLINTERS STUFF MY NIGHTMARE MOUTH;

THIS IS THE UNCONQUERABLE DROUTH

I CARRY IN MY BURNING HEAD.

NOT MY WORDS NOR YOUR VISIONS MEND

SUCH INFAMOUS KNOWLEDGE. WE ARE SPLIT

DONE INTO BITS UNDONE PALE FRIEND

AS ECSTASY BEGETS ITS END;

AS WE ARE SPUN OF RAWEST THREAD—

THE FLAW IS IN US; WE WILL BREAK.

O DARE YOU OF THIS FRACTURE MAKE

HOSANNAS PLAIN AND TRAGICAL

OR DARE I LET EACH CADENCE FALL

AWKWARD AS LEARNING NEWLY LEARNED

SIMPLE AS CHILDREN’S CRADLE SONGS

AS UNTRANSLATABLE AND TRUE

WE SOMEDAY MIGHT CONCEIVE A WAY

TO DO THE THING WE LONG TO DO—

TO DO WHAT MEN HAVE ALWAYS DONE—

TO LIVE IN TIME TO ACT IN SPACE

YET FIND A RITUAL TO EMBRACE

RAW TOWNS OF MAN THE POCKMARKED SUN.

THE SNOW QUEEN

CHILD WITH A CHIP OF MIRROR IN HIS EYE

SAW THE WORLD UGLY FLED TO PLAINS OF ICE

WHERE BEAUTY WAS THE SNOW QUEEN’S PROMISES.

UNDER MY LIDS A SPLINTER SHARP AS HIS

HAS MADE ME WISH YOU LYING DEAD

WHOSE IMAGE DIGS THE NEEDLE DEEPER STILL.

IN THE DECEPTIVE PROVINCE OF MY BIRTH

I HAD SEEN YES TURN NO THE SAINTS DESCEND

THEIR SACRED FACES TWISTED INTO SMILES

THE STARS GONE LECHERING THE VILLAGE SPRING

GUSH MUD AND TOADS—ALL MIRACLES

BEFITTING AN INCALCULABLE AGE.

TO LOVE A HUMAN FACE WAS TO DISCOVER

THE CRACKS OF PAINT AND VARNISH ON THE BROW;

SOON TO DISTRUST ALL IMPULSES OF FLESH

THAT STREWS ITS SAWDUST ON THE CHAMBER FLOOR

WHILE AT THE WINDOW PEER TWO CRONES

WHO ONCE WERE JULIET AND JESSICA.

NO MATTER SINCE I KEPT A LITTLE WHILE

ONE THING INTACT FROM THAT PERVERSITY—

THOUGH LANDSCAPES BLOOMED IN MONSTROUS CUBES AND COILS.

IN YOU BELONGED SIMPLICITIES OF LIGHT

TO MEND DISTRACTION TEACH THE AIR

TO SHINE THE STARS TO FIND THEIR WAY AGAIN.

YET HERE THE SNOW QUEEN’S COLD PRODIGIOUS WILL

COMMANDS ME AND YOUR FACE HAS LOST ITS POWER

DISSOLVING TO ITS OPPOSITE LIKE THE REST.

UNDER MY RIBS A DIAMOND SPLINTER NOW

STICKS AND HAS TAKEN ROOT; I KNOW

ONLY THIS FROZEN SPEAR THAT DRIVES ME THROUGH.

LOVE IN THE MUSEUM

NOW WILL YOU STAND FOR ME IN THIS COOL LIGHT

INFANTA REARED IN ANCIENT ETIQUETTE

A POINT-LACE QUEEN OF MANNERS. AT YOUR FEET

THE DOLL-LIKE ROYAL DOG DEMURELY SET

UPON A CHEQUERED FLOOR OF BLACK AND WHITE.

OR BE A LOUIS’ MISTRESS BY BOUCHER

LOUNGING ON CUSHIONS SILKEN FEET ASPRAWL

UPON A COUCH WHERE CASUAL CUPIDS PLAY

WHILE ON YOUR ARMS AND SHOULDERS SEEMS TO FALL

THE TIRED EXTRAVAGANCE OF A SUNSET DAY.

OR LET ME THINK I PAUSE BESIDE A DOOR

AND SEE YOU IN A BODICE BY VERMEER

WHERE LIGHT FALLS QUARTERED ON THE POLISHED FLOOR

AND RIMS THE LINE OF WATER TILTING CLEAR

OUT OF AN EARTHEN PITCHER AS YOU POUR.

BUT ART REQUIRES A DISTANCE: LET ME BE

ALWAYS THE CONNOISSEUR OF YOUR PERFECTION.

STAY WHERE THE SPACES OF THE GALLERY

FLOW CALM BETWEEN YOUR POSE AND MY INSPECTION

LEST ONE IMPERFECT GESTURE MAKE DEMANDS

AS TROUBLING AS THE TOUCH OF HUMAN HANDS.

I HEARD A HERMIT SPEAK

UPON THE MOUNTAIN OF THE YOUNG

I HEARD A HERMIT SPEAK:

“PURITY IS THE SERPENT’S EYE

THAT MURDERS WITH A LOOK.

PURITY’S KING OF POISONS

AND DUKE OF DEADLY NIGHT.

ABHOR THE SINGLE-MINDED MAN

THE WOMAN LILY-WHITE.

GO COLD UNDER THE HEAVENS

RUN NAKED THROUGH THE DAY

BUT NEVER WEAR THE ARMORED SHIRT

OF TOTAL YEA OR NAY.

STARE INTO THE LOOKING-GLASS:

YOUR ENEMY STARES YOU BACK.

YET NEVER CRINGE AND HIDE YOUR FACE;

HEAR ALL THAT HE WILL SPEAK.

THE DAY THAT GLASS DISSOLVES TO SHOW

YOUR OWN REFLECTION THERE

THEN CHANGE YOUR MIRROR FOR THE WORLD

THE TEEMING STREAMING AIR.

O LET YOUR HUMAN MEMORY END

HEAVY WITH THOUGHT AND ACT.

CLAIM EVERY JOY OF PARADOX

THAT TIME WOULD KEEP INTACT.

BE RICH AS YOU ARE HUMAN”

I HEARD THAT HERMIT CRY

TO THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

ALL WALKING OUT TO DIE.

COLOPHON

IN THIS LONG ROOM UPON EACH WESTERN PANE

THE SUNSET WREAKS ITS FINAL SAVAGE STAIN;

AND WE LIKE MASQUERS COSTUMED IN AN AIR

OUTCRIMSONING THE GAUDIEST COCK THAT CROWS

PARADE AS TORCHES AND DIABOLOS

ALONG THE BLOOD-RED SPIRAL OF THE STAIR.

AN IMMINENT AMAZEMENT OF THE HEART

CONSTRICTS OUR GREETING AS WE MEET AND PART.

A GESTURE OR A WORD CAN MAKE US TURN

READY TO CRY A SUDDEN SHARP GOODNIGHT;

YET STILL DELAYS THE DARK STILL COCKEREL-BRIGHT

SMOULDER THE DYES IN WHICH WE WADE AND BURN.

NOT TRAGICAL THE FACES THAT WE WEAR:

A MODERN GAIETY FITTING AS DESPAIR

SHALL PASS THE HOUR TILL DOMES AND SUNSETS FALL.

EXTRAVAGANT AND CEREMONIOUS WORDS

RISE ON THE AIR LIKE FLIGHTS OF CHINESE BIRDS

UNCAGED UPON A FIERY CARNIVAL.

WHAT’S LEFT US IN THIS VIOLENT SPECTACLE

BUT KISSES ON THE MOUTH OR WORKS OF WILL—

THE IMAGINATION’S FORM SO STERNLY WROUGHT

THE FLASHES OF THE BRAIN SO BOLDLY PENNED

THAT WHEN THE SUNSET GUTTERS TO ITS END

THE WORLD’S LAST THOUGHT WILL BE OUR FLARING THOUGHT?

A WALK BY THE CHARLES

FINALITY BROODS UPON THE THINGS THAT PASS:

PERSUADED BY THIS AIR THE TRUMP OF DOOM

MIGHT HANG UNSOUNDED WHILE THE AUTUMN GLOOM

DARKENS THE LEAF AND SMOKES THE RIVER’S GLASS.

FOR NOTHING SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEATH

BUT ON THIS FORENOON SEEMS TO HOLD ITS BREATH:

THE SILENT SINGLE OARSMEN ON THE STREAM

ARE ALWAYS YOUNG ARE ROWERS IN A DREAM.

THE LOVERS UNDERNEATH THE CHESTNUT TREE

THOUGH LOVE IS OVER STAND BEMUSED TO SEE

THE SEASON FALLING WHERE NO FALL COULD BE.

YOU OARSMEN WHEN YOU ROW BEYOND THE BEND

WILL SEE THE RIVER WINDING TO ITS END.

LOVERS THAT HOLD THE CHESTNUT BURR IN HAND

WILL SPEAK AT LAST OF DEATH WILL UNDERSTAND

FOOT-DEEP AMID THE RUINAGE OF THE YEAR

WHAT SMELL IT IS THAT STINGS THE GATHERING AIR.

FROM OUR EVASION WE ARE BROUGHT AT LAST

FROM ALL OUR HOPES OF CONSTANCY TO CAST

ONE LOOK OF RECOGNITION AT THE SKY

THE UNIMPORTANT LEAVES THAT FLUTTER BY.

WHY ELSE UPON THIS BANK ARE WE SO STILL?

WHAT LENDS US ANCHOR BUT THE MUTABLE?

O LOVERS LET THE BRIDGE OF YOUR TWO HANDS

BE BROKEN LIKE THE MIRRORED BRIDGE THAT BENDS

AND SHIVERS ON THE SURFACE OF THE STREAM.

YOUNG OARSMEN WHO IN TIMELESS GESTURE SEEM

CONTINUOUS UNITED WITH THE TIDE

LEAVE OFF YOUR BENDING TO THE OAR AND GLIDE

PAST INNOCENCE BEYOND THESE AGING BRICKS

TO WHERE THE CHARLES FLOWS IN TO JOIN THE STYX.

NEW YEAR MORNING

THE BELLS HAVE QUIT THEIR CLANGING; HERE BENEATH

THE COLDLY FURIOUS STREAKS OF MORNING STARS

WE HEAR THE SCRAPING OF THE LAST FEW CARS

AND ON THE DOORSTEP BY THE FROZEN WREATH

RETURN GOODNIGHTS TO NIGHT. DEAR FRIENDS ONCE MORE

WE’VE HELD OUR STRENGTH AGAINST A STRAINING DOOR

AGAIN THE SIEGE IS PAST ANOTHER YEAR

HAS LOST THE BATTLE. YOU CAN LEAVE US NOW.

THE HOURS ARE DONE THAT MUST BE CLAMORED THROUGH

LEST DARKNESS THINK US SLEEPING LEST WE HEAR

SECRET POLICE ENGENDERED OUT OF NIGHT

ADVANCING ON OUR LITTLE ZONE OF LIGHT.

NOW EACH OF US CAN DARE TO BE ALONE

HIS ROOM NO LONGER POPULOUS WITH SPIES

BENDING ABOVE THE PILLOW WHERE HE LIES

TO SOW HIS DREAMS WITH FEAR THAT ALL IS DONE

THAT THERE’S NO MORE REPRIEVE NO LEAF TO TEAR

AND FIND ANOTHER JANUARY THERE.

SO WE ARE SAFE AGAIN. GOODNIGHT BRAVE FRIENDS.

SO MAY BEGINNINGS ALWAYS FOLLOW ENDS.

THOUGH TIME IS TREASONABLE MAY WE STAND

GATHERED EACH YEAR A STUBBORN-HEARTED BAND

WHOSE GAIETY RISES LIKE A LITANY

UNDER THE DYING ORNAMENTAL TREE.

IN TIME OF CARNIVAL

THOSE LIGHTS THAT PLAZA—I SHOULD KNOW THEM ALL:

THE IMPOTENT BLIND BEGGAR SHOUTING HIS SONGS

OF LOVERS WHILE THE HEADLONG POPULACE

DRINKS TRAMPLES IMMOLATES ITSELF IN ACTION;

THE BLOODY LIGHT OF BRAZIERS ON THE FACES

OF WOMEN WHO ARE ACTION’S MEANS AND END

EACH A LAUGHING FURY; THE TOWERING GLASS

OF THOSE CATHEDRAL SAINTS WHOSE STIFFENED FORMS

RUBY IN PASSING TORCHLIGHT STOOP TO DARK

AND FLARE AGAIN AS PUPPETS OF DISORDER

LIFELESS WITHOUT ITS LIGHT BUT IN THAT ROUT

ILLUMINED AND EMPOWERED. THERE’S NO CROWD

IN NAVE OR PLAYHOUSE ANY MORE; FOR ALL

ARE ACTORS WHERE MERE PASTEBOARD ROARS TO HEAVEN

UNDER THE DROPPED MATCH AND THE STREETS ALONE

THE AMPHITHEATRE OF GREAT NIGHT ITSELF

SUFFICE TO CONTAIN THEIR SCENE. NOTHING WILL DO

BUT ACTION OF THE SENSES TOTAL SEIZURE

OF WHAT’S TO HAND. AND THROUGH THE SWAYING STREETS

THAT BEGGAR IMPOTENT SINCE YOUTH SINGS ON

IGNORANT OF THE SCENE BLIND TO HIS POWER

THE SONGS THAT SEND THOSE LOVERS WILD TO BED.

THE MIDDLE-AGED

THEIR FACES SAFE AS AN INTERIOR

OF HOLLAND TILES AND ORIENTAL CARPET

WHERE THE FRUIT-BOWL ALWAYS FILLED STOOD IN A LIGHT

OF PLACID AFTERNOON—THEIR VOICES’ MEASURE

THEIR FIGURES MOVING IN THE SUNDAY GARDEN

TO LAY THE TEA OUTDOORS OR TRIM THE BORDERS

AFFLICTED HAUNTED US. FOR TO BE YOUNG

WAS ALWAYS TO LIVE IN OTHER PEOPLE’S HOUSES

WHOSE PEACE IF WE SOUGHT IT HAD BEEN MADE BY OTHERS

WAS OURS AT SECOND-HAND AND NOT FOR LONG.

THE CUSTOM OF THE HOUSE NOT OURS THE SUN

FADING THE SILVER-BLUE FORTUNY CURTAINS

THE REMINISCENCE OF A CHRISTMAS PARTY

OF FOURTEEN YEARS AGO—ALL MEMORY

SIGNS OF POSSESSION AND OF BEING POSSESSED

WE TASTED TENSE WITH ENVY. THEY WERE SO KIND

WOULD HAVE GIVEN US ANYTHING; THE BOWL OF FRUIT

WAS FILLED FOR US THERE WAS A ROOM UPSTAIRS

WE MUST CALL OURS: BUT TWENTY YEARS OF LIVING

THEY COULD NOT GIVE. NOR DID THEY EVER SPEAK

OF THE COARSE STAIN ON THAT POLISHED BALUSTRADE

THE CRACK IN THE STUDY WINDOW OR THE LETTERS

LOCKED IN A DRAWER AND THE KEY DESTROYED.

ALL TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY US RETURNING

LATE IN OUR OWN TIME—HOW THAT PEACE WAS MADE

UPON WHAT TERMS WITH HOW MUCH LEFT UNSAID.

THE MARRIAGE PORTION

FROM COMMISSARS OF DAYLIGHT

LOVE CANNOT MAKE US FREE.

NIGHTS OF UNGRACIOUS DARKNESS

HANG OVER YOU AND ME.

WE LIE AWAKE TOGETHER

AND HEAR THE CLOCKS STRIKE THREE.

OUR LOVING CANNOT EXILE

THE FELONS BUT AND IF;

YET BEING UNDIVIDED

SOME WAYS WE CAN CONTRIVE

TO HOLD OFF THOSE BESIEGERS

WHO BATTER ROUND OUR LIFE:

THE THIEVES OF OUR COMPLETENESS

WHO STEAL US STONE BY STONE

THE PATRONAGE THAT SCOWLS UPON

OUR NEED TO BE ALONE

AND ALL THE CLEVER PEOPLE

WHO WANT US FOR THEIR OWN.

THE TELEPHONE IS RINGING

AND PLANES AND TRAINS DEPART.

THE COCKTAIL PARTY’S FORMING

THE CRUISE ABOUT TO START.

TO STAY BEHIND IS FATAL—

ACT NOW THE TIME IS SHORT.

IF WE REFUSE THE SUMMONS

AND STAND AT LAST ALONE

WE WALK INTACT AND CERTAIN

AS MAN AND WOMAN GROWN

IN THE DESERTED PLAYGROUND

WHEN ALL THE REST HAVE GONE.

THE TREE

LONG AGO I FOUND A SEED

AND KEPT IT IN A GLASS OF WATER

AND HALF FORGOT MY DIM INTENT

UNTIL I SAW IT START TO REACH

FOR LIFE WITH ONE BLIND FRAGILE ROOT.

AND THEN I PRESSED IT INTO EARTH

AND SAW ITS TENDRILS SEEK THE AIR

SO SLOWLY THAT I HARDLY KNEW

OF ANY CHANGE TILL IT HAD GROWN

A STALK A LEAF; AND SEEMED TO BE

NO MORE A THING IN NEED OF ME

BUT LIVING BY SOME SAPIENCE

I HAD NOT GIVEN COULD NOT WITHDRAW.

SO IT GREW ON AND DAYS WENT BY

AND SEASONS WITH THEIR COMMON GIFTS

TILL AT THE LEAFAGE OF THE YEAR

I FELT THE SUN CUT OFF FROM ME

BY SOMETHING THICK OUTSIDE MY ROOM—

NOT YET A TREE GROWN TO THE FULL

YET SO ENDOWED WITH NEED AND WILL

IT TOOK THE WARMTH AND LEFT ME COLD.

AND FIRST I CLIMBED WITH HOOK AND SHEARS

TO PRUNE THE BOUGHS THAT DARKENED ME

BUT THE TREE WAS STUBBORNER THAN I

AND WHERE I CLIPPED IT GREW AGAIN

BRUTAL IN PURPOSE AS A WEED.

NOR DID IT GIVE OF FRUIT OR FLOWER

THOUGH SEASONS BROUGHT THEIR COMMON GIFTS

AND YEARS WENT BY. IT ONLY GREW

DARKER AND DENSER TO MY VIEW

TAKING WHATEVER I WOULD YIELD—

THE HOMAGE OF A TROUBLED MIND—

REQUIRING NOTHING YET ACCEPTING

MY WILLINGNESS TO GUARD ITS LIFE

BY THE ENDURANCE OF MY OWN.

IT GIVES ME NOTHING; YET I SEE

SOMETIMES IN DREAMS MY ENEMY

HANGED BY THE HAIR UPON THAT TREE.

LOVERS ARE LIKE CHILDREN

CHAGALL’S SWEET LOVERS MOUNTING INTO BLUE

REMIND ME THAT DISCOVERY BY TWO

OF ANY WORLD THE MIND CAN WANDER THROUGH

IS LIKE THE TIME WHEN YOUNG AND LEFT ALONE

WE TOUCHED THE SECRET FRINGE OF BEING ONE

BACK OF THE PLAYGROUND FULL OF EVERYONE.

LOVE IS LIKE CHILDHOOD CAUGHT IN TRUST AND FEAR.

THE STATUES POINT TO OMENS IN THE AIR

AND YET THE FOUNTAINS BUBBLE BRIGHT AND CLEAR.

LOST IN THE GARDEN RANK WITH CONTRADICTION

WE SEE THE FENCES SPROUT FOR OUR AFFLICTION

AND THE RED-ROSE-TREE CURTLY LABELLED FICTION.

NOTHING TO TELL US WHETHER WHAT THEY MEAN

IS TRUE OF THIS OR ANY OTHER SCENE.

WE ONLY KNOW THE SUMMER LEAVES ARE GREEN

ALIVE AND DENSE FOR TWO TO PENETRATE—

AN EXPLORATION DIFFICULT AND GREAT

AS WHEN ONE DAY BESIDE THE SCHOOLYARD GATE

STRAGGLING BEHIND TO GLEAN A SUNLIT STONE

ONE FIRST PERCEIVED AND KNEW ITSELF AS ONE.

NOW ADD THIS PEBBLE TO THAT EARLY ONE.

WHEN THIS CLANGOR IN THE BRAIN

SAY A MASTER OF THE TRACK

LIGHTLY LEAPED AND LIGHTLY RAN

KNEW HIS POWERS OF CHEST AND THIGH

CLEAN OUTSTRIPPED THE THOUGHT OF MAN—

WOULD IT NOT BE PILL AND PATCH

AND WORSE THAN QUEASY CRIPPLES KNOW

IF ON A DAY THE RHEUM SHOULD CATCH

AND LAY THAT MASTER LEAPER LOW?

SAY THAT INTO CERTAIN MINDS

A MERLIN DANCES IN AND OUT

AND WHAT HE CHOOSES MUST OBEY

AND SWAY THE THOUGHT IT THINKS ABOUT—

WOULD IT NOT BE OLD FOLKS’ HOME

AND THE DRY END OF THE YEAR

FOR THE MIND HE LEFT AGAIN

UNMASTERED LOCK AND STOCK AND GEAR?

WHEN THIS CLANGOR IN THE BRAIN

GROWS PERFUNCTORY OR WORSE

PUT ME DOWN A SICK OLD WOMAN

PROPPED FOR SLEEP HIRE ME A NURSE;

TILL THEN ALL THINGS I LOOK UPON

BEAT ON MY BRAIN TO HAIL AND BLESS

AND EVERY LAST AND WAYWARD POWER

I CLAIM TILL THEN AND NOTHING LESS.

A VIEW OF MERTON COLLEGE

AN INTERVAL: THE VIEW ACROSS THE FIELDS

PERFECT AND INSUSCEPTIBLE AS SEEN

IN PRINTSHOPS OF THE HIGH STREET—SUN ON STONE

WORN LIKE OLD NEEDLEWORK THE SHEEN OF GRASS

MINUTE AND AGELESS FIGURES MOVING DOWN

THE BROAD WALK UNDER TINTED TREES. AWHILE

MIND’S LOCAL JANGLING LIGHTENS EAR IS EASED

EYE’S FLAW IS MENDED IN SUCH GAZING HEALED

BY SEPARATION AS THROUGH GLASS. UNTIL

SUN SHIFTS AIR TURNS HARSHER PALER ROOKS

FLAP IN THE RISING WIND. THE WIND HAS FOUND YOU

THE MORTAL LIGHT OF DAY WHOSE ENVY WASTE

IRRESOLUTION TREAD YOU AS YOU GO

GUILTY AND HUMAN. HERE AS ANYWHERE

PEACE OF THE MIND LIES THROUGH AN ARCH OF STONE

THE LIMITATIONS POSTED STRICT AND CLEAR:

NOT TO BE LITTERED OR PRESUMED UPON.

HOLIDAY

SUMMER WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY WHERE THE BIRDS

WOKE US AT DAWN AMONG THE DRIPPING LEAVES

AND LENT TO ALL OUR FÊTES THEIR SWEET APPROVAL.

THE TOUCH OF AIR ON FLESH WAS LIGHTER KEENER

THE SENSES FLOURISHED LIKE A LADEN TREE

WHOSE EVERY GESTURE FINISHES IN A FLOWER.

IN THOSE UNWARDENED PROVINCES WE DINED

FROM WICKER BASKETS BY A GREEN CANAL

STAINING OUR LIPS WITH PEACH AND NECTARINE

SLAPPING AT GOLDEN WASPS. AND WHEN WE KISSED

TASTING THAT SUNLIT JUICE THE LANDSCAPE FOLDED

INTO OUR CLASP AND NOT A BREATH RECALLED

THE LONG WALK BACK TO WINTER LEAGUES AWAY.

THE CAPITAL

UNDER THAT SUMMER ASPHALT UNDER VISTAS

ASPIRING TO A NEO-CLASSIC CALM

THE STEAMING BURGEON OF POTOMAC’S SWAMP

HAS NEVER QUITE BEEN LAID TO REST. THE EYE

WINCES IN SUNLIGHT OFF A MARBLE DOME.

BUT CANNOT FIX THE FACE OF JEFFERSON

THROUGH HAZE OF AN OUTRAGEOUS ATMOSPHERE

BY DIPLOMATS CALLED TROPIC; NOR CAN THE EAR

HOLD TO THE LIFELINE OF A SINGLE VOICE

THROUGH JETTISONED RUMORS JAMMING ALL THE AIR.

THE DOLLAR IN THAT CITY OF INSCRIPTIONS

IS MINTED AMONG PEDIMENTS AND COLUMNS

PURER THAN NEWMADE COIN. THE AFTERNOON

STEAMS WITH THE DRIP OF DEPARTMENTAL FOUNTAINS

AND HUMID BRANCHES BREATHING OVERHEAD

DOWN AVENUES WHERE THE SIREN’S NERVOUS SHRIEK

PURSUES THE MURDERER OR THE FOREIGN GUEST

THROUGH THOSE INDIFFERENT NOONDAY CROWDS WHO NEVER

ASK TILL HISTORY TELLS THEM WHAT THEY DO

IN THAT METROPOLIS ANYTHING BUT GREEK.

THE PLATFORM

THE RAILWAY STATIONS OF OUR DAILY PLIGHT

SEE EVERY HOUR LOVE’S THREATENED OVERTHROW.

EACH AFTERNOON AT FIVE THE BUSES GO

LADEN WITH THOSE WHO SHALL BE FALSE BY NIGHT.

WE SAY GOODBYE IN ROOMS TOO BRIGHT WITH NOISE

TO CATCH THE SHADES OF A RECEDING VOICE;

WE TURN AT THE REVOLVING DOOR AND SEE

LOVE’S FACE ALREADY CHANGED INDELIBLY.

NOT TO ADMIT WE MAY NOT MEET AGAIN—

THIS WAS THE PARTING TREASON OF OUR THOUGHT.

BATTERING DOWN OUR COWARDLY “TILL THEN”

TIME’S TRAFFIC HEMS THE SEEKER FROM THE SOUGHT.

WE TAKE TOO SUDDEN LEAVE; THE PLATFORM REELS

WITH THUNDER OF A THOUSAND POUNDING HEELS

AND AT THE GATE WHERE ONE REMAINS BEHIND

THOUGH MOST WE STRAIN TO SEE WE MOST ARE BLIND.

DEAR LOVES DEAR FRIENDS I TAKE MY LEAVE ALL DAY

IN PRACTICE FOR A TIME THAT NEED NOT COME.

I TURN AND MOVE FROM YOU A LITTLE WAY

AS MEN WALK OUT BEYOND THE FIELDS OF HOME

IN TROUBLED DAYS TO VIEW WHAT THEY LOVE WELL—

DISTANCE CONFIRMING FOR A MOMENT’S SPELL

MEETING OR GOING THAT WHEN WE EMBRACE

WE KNOW THE HEART BEYOND THE TRANSIENT FACE.

LAST SONG

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS BORN

I WALKED ACROSS THE SHOUTING CORN;

I SAW THE SUNLIGHT FLASH AND HAIL

FROM EVERY SPIRE AND EVERY SAIL

BUT MOST I LEANED AGAINST THE SKY

TO HEAR THE EAGLES RACING BY

AND ALL THE SAFETY OF THE WOMB

COULD NOT BETRAY ME LURE ME HOME.

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS WED

I SAW THEM STREW MY BRIDAL BED.

I SMELLED THE WIND ACROSS THE SHEETS

BREATHING OF LAVENDER AND SWEETS

THAT NEITHER SEA NOR MEADOW KNEW;

AND WHEN MY BRIDE WAS BROUGHT TO VIEW

I KEPT A HUNDRED CANDLES LIT

ALL FOR LIGHT AND THE JOY OF IT.

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS OLD

I FELT THE WIND BLOW SALT AND COLD

LIKE SEASPRAY ON MY SHAKING THIGHS

OR SAND FLUNG UP TO BLIND MY EYES.

I CRIED FOR SUN AND THE EAGLES FLYING

BUT FELT THOSE FINGERS SPYING PRYING

THE SAME THAT WRENCHED ME INTO LIFE

AND CUT MY SAFETY WITH A KNIFE.

SOON THEY WILL BIND ME DARK AND WARM

AND IMPOTENT TO SUFFER HARM.

I SHALL BE EXILED TO THE WOMB

WHERE ONCE I LAY AND THOUGHT IT HOME.

THE SUN THAT FLASHED MY FIRST DELIGHT

SHALL NEVER LEARN TO CLEAVE THAT NIGHT;

AND ALL THE SWORDS OF DANGER FLY

FAR FROM THE CAUL IN WHICH I LIE.

THE DIAMOND CUTTERS

HOWEVER LEGENDARY

THE STONE IS STILL A STONE

THOUGH IT HAD ONCE RESISTED

THE WEIGHT OF AFRICA

THE HAMMER-BLOWS OF TIME

THAT WEAR TO BITS OF RUBBLE

THE MOUNTAIN AND THE PEBBLE—

BUT NOT THIS COLDEST ONE.

NOW YOU INTELLIGENCE

SO LATE DREDGED UP FROM DARK

UPON WHOSE SMOKY WALLS

BISON TOOK FUMBLING FORM

OR FLINT WAS EDGED ON FLINT—

NOW CAREFUL ARRIVISTE

DELINEATE AT WILL

INCISIONS IN THE ICE.

BE SERIOUS BECAUSE

THE STONE MAY HAVE CONTEMPT

FOR TOO-FAMILIAR HANDS

AND BECAUSE ALL YOU DO

LOSES OR GAINS BY THIS:

RESPECT THE ADVERSARY

MEET IT WITH TOOLS REFINED

AND THEREBY SET YOUR PRICE.

BE HARD OF HEART BECAUSE

THE STONE MUST LEAVE YOUR HAND.

ALTHOUGH YOU LIBERATE

PURE AND EXPENSIVE FIRES

FIT TO ENAMOR SHEBAS

KEEP YOUR DESIRE APART.

LOVE ONLY WHAT YOU DO

AND NOT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

BE PROUD WHEN YOU HAVE SET

THE FINAL SPOKE OF FLAME

IN THAT PRISMATIC WHEEL

AND NOTHING’S LEFT THIS DAY

EXCEPT TO SEE THE SUN

SHINE ON THE FALSE AND THE TRUE

AND KNOW THAT AFRICA

WILL YIELD YOU MORE TO DO.

AT MAJORITY

FOR C.

WHEN YOU ARE OLD AND BEAUTIFUL

AND THINGS MOST DIFFICULT ARE DONE

THERE WILL BE FEW WHO CAN RECALL

YOUR FACE THAT I SEE RAVAGED NOW

BY YOUTH AND ITS OPPRESSIVE WORK.

YOUR LOOK WILL HOLD THEIR WONDERING LOOKS

GRAVE AS CORDELIA’S AT THE LAST

NEITHER WITH RANCOR AT THE PAST

NOR TO UPBRAID THE COMING TIME.

FOR YOU WILL BE AT PEACE WITH TIME.

BUT NOW A DAILY WARFARE TAKES

ITS TOLL OF TENDERNESS IN YOU

AND YOU MUST LIVE LIKE CAPTAINS WHO

WAIT OUT THE HOUR BEFORE THE CHARGE—

FEARFUL AND YET IMPATIENT TOO.

YET SOMEDAY THIS WILL HAVE AN END

ALL CHOICES MADE OR CHOICE RESIGNED

AND IN YOUR FACE THE LITERAL EYE

TRACE LITTLE OF YOUR HISTORY

NOR EVER PIECE THE TALE ENTIRE

OF VILLAGES THAT HAD TO BURN

AND PLAYGROUNDS OF THE WILL DESTROYED

BEFORE YOU COULD BE SAFE FROM TIME

AND GATHER IN YOUR BROW AND AIR

THE STILLNESS OF ANTIQUITY.

1954

FROM MORNING-GLORY TO
PETERSBURG

(THE WORLD BOOK 1928)

“ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE IN STORY AND PICTURE”

CONFRONTS THROUGH DUSTY GLASS

AN EYE GROWN DUBIOUS.

I CAN RECALL WHEN KNOWLEDGE STILL WAS PURE

NOT CONTRADICTORY PLEASURABLE

AS CUTTING OUT A PAPER DOLL.

YOU OPENED UP A BOOK AND THERE IT WAS:

EVERYTHING JUST AS PROMISED FROM

KURDISTAN TO MORMONS GUM

ARABIC TO KUMQUAT NEITHER MORE NOR LESS.

FACTS COULD BE KEPT SEPARATE

BY A CONVENTION; THAT WAS WHAT

MADE CHILDHOOD POSSIBLE. NOW KNOWLEDGE FINDS ME OUT;

IN ALL ITS RISIBLE UNTIDINESS

IT TRACES ME TO EACH ADDRESS

DRAGGING IN THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT.

I DON’T INVITE WHAT FACTS CAN BE

HELD AT ARM’S LENGTH; A FAMILY

OF JEERING IRRESPONSIBLES ALWAYS

COMES ALONG GYPSY-STYLE

AND THERE YOU HAVE THEM ALL

FOREVER ON YOUR HANDS. IT NEVER PAYS.

IF I COULD STILL EXTRAPOLATE

THE MORNING-GLORY ON THE GATE

FROM PETERSBURG IN HISTORY—BUT IT’S TOO LATE.

1954

RURAL REFLECTIONS

THIS IS THE GRASS YOUR FEET ARE PLANTED ON.

YOU PAINT IT ORANGE OR YOU SING IT GREEN

BUT YOU HAVE NEVER FOUND

A WAY TO MAKE THE GRASS MEAN WHAT YOU MEAN.

A CLOUD CAN BE WHATEVER YOU INTEND:

OSTRICH OR LEANING TOWER OR STARING EYE.

BUT YOU HAVE NEVER FOUND

A CLOUD SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS THE SKY.

GET OUT THERE WITH YOUR SPLENDID EXPERTISE;

RAYMOND WHO CUTS THE MEADOW DOES NO LESS.

INHUMAN NATURE SAYS:

INHUMAN PATIENCE IS THE TRUE SUCCESS.

HUMAN IMPATIENCE TRIPS YOU AS YOU RUN;

STAND STILL AND YOU MUST LIE.

IT IS THE GRASS THAT CUTS THE MOWER DOWN;

IT IS THE CLOUD THAT SWALLOWS UP THE SKY.

A KNIGHT RIDES INTO THE NOON

AND HIS HELMET POINTS TO THE SUN

AND A THOUSAND SPLINTERED SUNS

ARE THE GAIETY OF HIS MAIL.

THE SOLES OF HIS FEET GLITTER

AND HIS PALMS FLASH IN REPLY

AND UNDER HIS CRACKLING BANNER

HE RIDES LIKE A SHIP IN SAIL.

A KNIGHT RIDES INTO THE NOON

AND ONLY HIS EYE IS LIVING

A LUMP OF BITTER JELLY

SET IN A METAL MASK

BETRAYING RAGS AND TATTERS

THAT CLING TO THE FLESH BENEATH

AND WEAR HIS NERVES TO RIBBONS

UNDER THE RADIANT CASQUE.

WHO WILL UNHORSE THIS RIDER

AND FREE HIM FROM BETWEEN

THE WALLS OF IRON THE EMBLEMS

CRUSHING HIS CHEST WITH THEIR WEIGHT?

WILL THEY DEFEAT HIM GENTLY

OR LEAVE HIM HURLED ON THE GREEN

HIS RAGS AND WOUNDS STILL HIDDEN

UNDER THE GREAT BREASTPLATE?

1957

THE LOSER

A MAN THINKS OF THE WOMAN HE ONCE LOVED:
FIRST AFTER HER WEDDING AND THEN NEARLY A DECADE LATER.

I.

I KISSED YOU BRIDE AND LOST AND WENT

HOME FROM THAT BOURGEOIS SACRAMENT

YOUR CHEEK STILL TASTING COLD UPON

MY LIPS THAT GAVE YOU BENISON

WITH ALL THE SWAGGER THAT THEY KNEW—

AS LOSERS SOMEHOW LEARN TO DO.

YOUR WEDDING MADE MY EYES ACHE; SOON

THE WORLD WOULD BE WORSE OFF FOR ONE

MORE GOLDEN APPLE DROPPED TO GROUND

WITHOUT THE LEAST PROTESTING SOUND

AND YOU WOULD WINDFALL LIE AND WE

FORGET YOUR SHIMMER ON THE TREE.

BEAUTY IS ALWAYS WASTED: IF

NOT MIGNON’S SONG SUNG TO THE DEAF

AT ALL EVENTS TO THE UNMOVED.

A FACE LIKE YOURS CANNOT BE LOVED

LONG OR SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

ALMOST WE SEEM TO HOLD IT OFF.

II.

WELL YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT.

NOW WHEN THE WASH WITH ICE HANGS TAUT

THIS MORNING OF ST. VALENTINE

I SEE YOU STRIP THE SQUEAKING LINE

YOUR BODY WEIGHED AGAINST THE LOAD

AND ALL MY GROANS CAN DO NO GOOD.

BECAUSE YOU STILL ARE BEAUTIFUL

THOUGH SQUARED AND STIFFENED BY THE PULL

OF WHAT NINE WINDY YEARS HAVE DONE.

YOU HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS LOST A SON.

I SEE ALL YOUR INTELLIGENCE

FLUNG INTO THAT UNWEARIED STANCE.

MY ENVY IS OF NO AVAIL.

I TURN MY HEAD AND WISH HIM WELL

WHO CHAFED YOUR BEAUTY INTO USE

AND LIVES FOREVER IN A HOUSE

LIT BY THE FRICTION OF YOUR MIND.

YOU STAGGER IN AGAINST THE WIND.

1958

THE ABSENT-MINDED
ARE ALWAYS TO BLAME

WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR DOWN THERE

IN THE CRACKS OF THE PAVEMENT? OR UP THERE

BETWEEN THE PINEAPPLE AND THE ACANTHUS LEAF

IN THAT UNINSPIRED ORNAMENT? ODYSSEUS

WADING HALF-NAKED OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY

LIKE A GOD DEAD SERIOUS AMONG THOSE AT PLAY

COULD HARDLY BE MORE OUT OF IT. IN SCHOOL

WE STRIPED YOUR BACK WITH CHALK YOU ALL OBLIVIOUS

YOUR EYES HARNESSED BY A TRANSPARENT STRAND

REACHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS OR DOWN

LIKE A WELLCHAIN TO THE CENTER OF EARTH.

NOW WITH THOSE SAME EYES YOU PULL THE

PAVEMENTS UP LIKE OLD LINOLEUM

ARCHES OF TRIUMPH START TO LIQUEFY

MINUTES AFTER YOU SLOWLY TURN AWAY.

1958

EURYCLEA’S TALE

I HAVE TO WEEP WHEN I SEE IT THE GROWN BOY FRETTING

FOR A FATHER DAWDLING AMONG THE ISLES

AND THE SEASCAPE HOLLOWED OUT BY THAT BOY’S EDGED GAZE

TO RECEIVE ONE SPECK ONE ONLY FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHHELD.

AND THAT SPECK THAT CURIOUS MAN HAS KEPT FROM HOME

TILL HOME WOULD SEEM THE FORBIDDEN PLACE TILL BLOOD

AND THE TEARS OF AN OLD WOMAN MUST RUN DOWN

TO SATISFY THE GENIUS OF PLACE. EVEN THEN WHAT

CAN THEY DO TOGETHER FATHER AND SON?

THE DRIFTWOOD STRANGER AND THE ROOTED BOY

WHOSE EYES WILL HAVE NOTHING THEN TO ASK THE SEA.

BUT ALL THE TIME AND EVERYWHERE

LIES IN AMBUSH FOR THE DISTRACTED EYEBALL

LIGHT: LIGHT ON THE SHIP RACKED UP IN PORT

THE CHIMNEY-STONES THE SCAR WHITER THAN SMOKE

THAN HER FLANKS HER HAIR THAT TRUE BUT AGING BRIDE.

1958

SEPTEMBER 21

WEAR THE WEIGHT OF EQUINOCTIAL EVENING

LIGHT LIKE MELONS BRUISED ON ALL THE PORCHES.

FEEL THE HOUSES TENDERLY APPRAISE YOU

HOLD YOU IN THE WATCHFULNESS OF MOTHERS.

ONCE THE NIGHTTIME WAS A MILKY RIVER

WASHING PAST THE SWIMMERS IN THE SUNSET

RINSING OVER SLEEPERS OF THE MORNING.

SOON THE NIGHT WILL BE AN EYELESS QUARRY

WHERE THE SHRUNKEN DAYLIGHT AND ITS REBELS

LOOSENEDDIVE LIKE STONES IN PERFECT SILENCE

NAMES AND VOICES DROWN WITHOUT REFLECTION.

THEN THE HOUSES DRAW YOU. THEN THEY HAVE YOU.

1958

AFTER A SENTENCE
IN “MALTE LAURIDS BRIGGE”

THE MONTH’S EYE BLURS.

THE WINTER’S LUNGS ARE CRACKED.

ALONG BLOATED GUTTERS RACE

SHREDDED YOUR INJURED LEGIONS

THE WASTE OF OUR REMORSELESS SEARCH.

YOUR OLD UNUTTERED NAMES ARE HOLES

WORN IN OUR SKINS

THROUGH WHICH WE FEEL FROM TIME TO TIME

ABRASIVE WIND.

THOSE WHO ARE LOVED LIVE POORLY AND IN DANGER.

WE WHO WERE LOVED WILL NEVER

UNLIVE THAT CRIPPLING FEVER.

A DAY RETURNS A CERTAIN WEATHER

SPLATTERS THE PANES AND WE

ONCE MORE STARE IN THE EYE OF OUR FIRST FAILURE.

1958

SNAPSHOTS OF A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

1.

YOU ONCE A BELLE IN SHREVEPORT

WITH HENNA-COLORED HAIR SKIN LIKE A PEACHBUD

STILL HAVE YOUR DRESSES COPIED FROM THAT TIME

AND PLAY A CHOPIN PRELUDE

CALLED BY CORTOT: “DELICIOUS RECOLLECTIONS

FLOAT LIKE PERFUME THROUGH THE MEMORY.”

YOUR MIND NOW MOULDERING LIKE WEDDING-CAKE

HEAVY WITH USELESS EXPERIENCE RICH

WITH SUSPICION RUMOR FANTASY

CRUMBLING TO PIECES UNDER THE KNIFE-EDGE

OF MERE FACT. IN THE PRIME OF YOUR LIFE.

NERVY GLOWERING YOUR DAUGHTER

WIPES THE TEASPOONS GROWS ANOTHER WAY.

2.

BANGING THE COFFEE-POT INTO THE SINK

SHE HEARS THE ANGELS CHIDING AND LOOKS OUT

PAST THE RAKED GARDENS TO THE SLOPPY SKY.

ONLY A WEEK SINCE THEY SAID: HAVE NO PATIENCE.

THE NEXT TIME IT WAS: BE INSATIABLE.

THEN: SAVE YOURSELF; OTHERS YOU CANNOT SAVE.

SOMETIMES SHE’S LET THE TAPSTREAM SCALD HER ARM

A MATCH BURN TO HER THUMBNAIL

OR HELD HER HAND ABOVE THE KETTLE’S SNOUT

RIGHT IN THE WOOLLY STEAM. THEY ARE PROBABLY ANGELS

SINCE NOTHING HURTS HER ANY MORE EXCEPT

EACH MORNING’S GRIT BLOWING INTO HER EYES.

3.

A THINKING WOMAN SLEEPS WITH MONSTERS.

THE BEAK THAT GRIPS HER SHE BECOMES. AND NATURE

THAT SPRUNG-LIDDED STILL COMMODIOUS

STEAMER-TRUNK OF TEMPORA AND MORES

GETS STUFFED WITH IT ALL:THE MILDEWED ORANGE-FLOWERS

THE FEMALE PILLS THE TERRIBLE BREASTS

OF BOADICEA BENEATH FLAT FOXES’ HEADS AND ORCHIDS.

TWO HANDSOME WOMEN GRIPPED IN ARGUMENT

EACH PROUD ACUTE SUBTLE I HEAR SCREAM

ACROSS THE CUT GLASS AND MAJOLICA

LIKE FURIES CORNERED FROM THEIR PREY:

THE ARGUMENT AD FEMINAM ALL THE OLD KNIVES

THAT HAVE RUSTED IN MY BACK I DRIVE IN YOURS

MA SEMBLABLE MA SOEUR!

4.

KNOWING THEMSELVES TOO WELL IN ONE ANOTHER:

THEIR GIFTS NO PURE FRUITION BUT A THORN

THE PRICK FILED SHARP AGAINST A HINT OF SCORN …

READING WHILE WAITING

FOR THE IRON TO HEAT

WRITING MY LIFE HAD STOOD—A LOADED GUN—

IN THAT AMHERST PANTRY WHILE THE JELLIES BOIL AND SCUM

OR MORE OFTEN

IRON-EYED AND BEAKED AND PURPOSED AS A BIRD

DUSTING EVERYTHING ON THE WHATNOT EVERY DAY OF LIFE.

5.

DULCE RIDENS DULCE LOQUENS

SHE SHAVES HER LEGS UNTIL THEY GLEAM

LIKE PETRIFIED MAMMOTH-TUSK.

6.

WHEN TO HER LUTE CORINNA SINGS

NEITHER WORDS NOR MUSIC ARE HER OWN;

ONLY THE LONG HAIR DIPPING

OVER HER CHEEK ONLY THE SONG

OF SILK AGAINST HER KNEES

AND THESE

ADJUSTED IN REFLECTIONS OF AN EYE.

POISED TREMBLING AND UNSATISFIED BEFORE

AN UNLOCKED DOOR THAT CAGE OF CAGES

TELL US YOU BIRD YOU TRAGICAL MACHINE—

IS THIS FERTILISANTE DOULEUR? PINNED DOWN

BY LOVE FOR YOU THE ONLY NATURAL ACTION

ARE YOU EDGED MORE KEEN

TO PRISE THE SECRETS OF THE VAULT? HAS NATURE SHOWN

HER HOUSEHOLD BOOKS TO YOU DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

THAT HER SONS NEVER SAW?

7.

“TO HAVE IN THIS UNCERTAIN WORLD SOME STAY

WHICH CANNOT BE UNDERMINED IS

OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE.”

THUS WROTE

A WOMAN PARTLY BRAVE AND PARTLY GOOD

WHO FOUGHT WITH WHAT SHE PARTLY UNDERSTOOD.

FEW MEN ABOUT HER WOULD OR COULD DO MORE

HENCE SHE WAS LABELLED HARPY SHREW AND WHORE.

8.

“YOU ALL DIE AT FIFTEEN” SAID DIDEROT

AND TURN PART LEGEND PART CONVENTION.

STILL EYES INACCURATELY DREAM

BEHIND CLOSED WINDOWS BLANKENING WITH STEAM.

DELICIOUSLY ALL THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

ALL THAT WE WERE—FIRE TEARS

WIT TASTE MARTYRED AMBITION—

STIRS LIKE THE MEMORY OF REFUSED ADULTERY

THE DRAINED AND FLAGGING BOSOM OF OUR MIDDLE YEARS.

9.

NOT THAT IT IS DONE WELL BUT

THAT IT IS DONE AT ALL? YES THINK

OF THE ODDS! OR SHRUG THEM OFF FOREVER.

THIS LUXURY OF THE PRECOCIOUS CHILD

TIME’S PRECIOUS CHRONIC INVALID—

WOULD WE DARLINGS RESIGN IT IF WE COULD?

OUR BLIGHT HAS BEEN OUR SINECURE:

MERE TALENT WAS ENOUGH FOR US—

GLITTER IN FRAGMENTS AND ROUGH DRAFTS.

SIGH NO MORE LADIES.

TIME IS MALE

AND IN HIS CUPS DRINKS TO THE FAIR.

BEMUSED BY GALLANTRY WE HEAR

OUR MEDIOCRITIES OVER-PRAISED

INDOLENCE READ AS ABNEGATION

SLATTERN THOUGHT STYLED INTUITION

EVERY LAPSE FORGIVEN OUR CRIME

ONLY TO CAST TOO BOLD A SHADOW

OR SMASH THE MOULD STRAIGHT OFF.

FOR THAT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

TEAR GAS ATTRITION SHELLING.

FEW APPLICANTS FOR THAT HONOR.

10.

WELL

SHE’S LONG ABOUT HER COMING WHO MUST BE

MORE MERCILESS TO HERSELF THAN HISTORY.

HER MIND FULL TO THE WIND I SEE HER PLUNGE

BREASTED AND GLANCING THROUGH THE CURRENTS

TAKING THE LIGHT UPON HER

AT LEAST AS BEAUTIFUL AS ANY BOY

OR HELICOPTER

POISED STILL COMING

HER FINE BLADES MAKING THE AIR WINCE

BUT HER CARGO

NO PROMISE THEN:

DELIVERED

PALPABLE

OURS.

1958–1960

PASSING ON

THE LANDLORD’S HAMMER IN THE YARD

PATCHES A PORCH WHERE YOUR SHIRTS SWING

BRASHLY AGAINST MAY’S CREAMY BLUE.

THIS YEAR THE FORSYTHIA RAN WILD

CHROME SPLASHED ON THE SPRING EVENINGS

EVERY BUSH A PILE OF SULPHUR.

NOW RAGGED THEY BEND

UNDER THE LATE WIND’S ONSLAUGHT TOUSLED

AS MY HEAD BENEATH THE CLOTHESLINES.

SOON WE’LL BE OFF. I’LL PACK US INTO PARCELS

STUFF US IN BARRELS SHROUD US IN NEWSPAPERS

PAUSING TO MARVEL AT OLD BARGAIN SALES:

OH ALL THE CHANCES WE NEVER SEIZED!

EMPTINESS ROUND THE STOOP OF THE HOUSE

MINCES CATWISE WAITING FOR AN IN.

1959

THE RAVEN

IF ANTIQUE HATEFUL BIRD

FLAPPING THROUGH DAWNGAGGED STREETS

OF METAL SHOPFRONTS GRATED DOWN

ON PEDESTRIAN NERVE-ENDS

IF AS ON OLD FILM

MY FEATURES BLURRED AND GRAINED LIKE CEREAL

YOU FIND ME WALKING UP AND DOWN

WAITING FOR MY FIRST DREAM

DON’T TRY TO SULLY MY HEAD

WITH VENGEFUL SQUIRTINGS. FLY ON

RATFOOTED CAUTIONARY OF MY DARK

TILL WE MEET FURTHER ALONG.

YOU ARE NO DREAM OLD GENIUS.

I SMELL YOU GET MY TEETH ON EDGE

STAND IN MY SWEAT—IN MERCURY—

EVEN AS YOU PRIME YOUR FEATHERS AND SET SAIL.

1959

MERELY TO KNOW

I.

WEDGED IN BY EARTHWORKS

THROWN UP BY SNOUTERS BEFORE ME

I KICK AND SNUFFLE BREATHING IN

COBWEBS OF BEETLE-CUIRASS:

VAINGLORY OF POLISHED GREEN

INFALLIBLE PINCER RESONANT NERVE

A THICKENING ON THE AIR NOW

CONFUSION TO MY LUNGS NO MORE.

MY PREDECESSORS BLIND ME—

THEIR ZEAL EXHAUSTED AMONG ROOTS AND TUNNELS

THEY GASPED AND LOOKED UP ONCE OR TWICE

INTO THE BEECHTREE’S NIGHTBLACK GLITTER.

II.

LET ME TAKE YOU BY THE HAIR

AND DRAG YOU BACKWARD TO THE LIGHT

THERE SPONGELIKE PRESS MY GAZE

PATIENTLY UPON YOUR EYES

HOLD LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE

AGAINST YOU MY ENORMOUS QUESTION.

WHAT IF YOU CRINGE WHAT IF YOU WEEP?

SUFFER THIS AND YOU NEED SUFFER

NOTHING MORE. I’LL GIVE YOU BACK

YOURSELF AT LAST TO THE LAST PART.

I TAKE NOTHING ONLY LOOK.

CHANGE NOTHING. HAVE NO NEED TO CHANGE.

MERELY TO KNOW AND LET YOU GO.

1959

III.

SPIRIT LIKE WATER

MOLDED BY UNSEEN STONE

AND SANDBAR PLEATS AND FUNNELS

ACCORDING TO ITS OWN

SUBMERGED NECESSITY—

TO THE INDOLENT EYE

PURE WILLFULNESS TO THE STRAY

PINE-NEEDLE BOILING

IN THAT CASCADE-BENT POOL

A RANDOM FURY: LAW

IF THAT’S WHAT’S WANTED LIES

ASKING TO BE READ

IN THE DRIED BROOK-BED.

1961

ANTINOÜS: THE DIARIES

AUTUMN TORTURE. THE OLD SIGNS

SMEARED ON THE PAVEMENT SOPPING LEAVES

RUBBED INTO THE LANDSCAPE AS UNGUENT ON A BRUISE

BROUGHT INDOORS EVEN AS THEY BRING FLOWERS ENORMOUS

WITH THE COLORS OF THE BODY’S SECRET PARTS.

ALL THIS. AND THEN EVENINGS NEEDING TO BE OUT

WALKING FAST FIGHTING THE FIRE

THAT MUST DIE LIGHT THAT SETS MY TEETH ON EDGE WITH JOY

TILL ON THE BLACK EMBANKMENT

I’M A CART STOPPED IN THE RUTS OF TIME.

THEN AT SOME HOUSE THE RUMOR OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY

SATURATES A ROOM LIKE LILAC-WATER

IN THE STREAM OF A BATH FIRES SNAP HEADS ARE HIGH

GOLD HAIR AT NAPES OF NECKS GOLD IN GLASSES

GOLD IN THE THROAT POETRY OF FURS AND MANNERS.

WHY DO I SHIVER THEN? HAVEN’T I SEEN

OVER AND OVER BEFORE THE END OF AN EVENING

THE THREE OPENED COFFINS CARRIED IN AND LEFT IN A CORNER?

HAVEN’T I WATCHED AS SOMEBODY CRACKED HIS SHIN

ON ONE OF THEM WINCED AND HOPPED AND LIMPED

LAUGHING TO LAY HIS HAND ON A BEAUTIFUL ARM

STRIATED WITH HAIRS OF GOLD LIKE AN ALMOND-SHELL?

THE OLD NEEDLESS STORY. FOR IF I’M HERE

IT IS BY CHOICE AND WHEN AT LAST

I SMELL MY OWN RISING NAUSEA FEEL THE AIR

TIGHTEN AROUND MY STOMACH LIKE A SURGICAL BANDAGE

I CAN’T PRETEND SURPRISE. WHAT IS IT I SO MISCARRY?

IF WHAT I SPEW ON THE TILES AT LAST

HELPLESS DISGRACED ALONE

IS IN PART WHAT I’VE SWALLOWED FROM GLASSES EYES

MOTIONS OF HANDS OPENING AND CLOSING MOUTHS

ISN’T IT ALSO DEAD GOBBETS OF MYSELF

ABORTIVE MURDERED OR NEVER WILLED?

1959

JUVENILIA

YOUR IBSEN VOLUMES VIOLET-SPINED

EACH FLAKING ITS GOLD ARABESQUE!

AGAIN I SIT UNDER DURESS HANDS WASHED

AT YOUR INKSTAINED OAKEN DESK

BY THE GOOSE-NECK LAMP IN THE TROPIC OF YOUR BOOKS

STABBING THE BLOTTING-PAD DOODLING LOOP UPON LOOP

PEERING ONE-EYED IN THE DUSTY REFLECTING MIRROR

OF YOUR STUDENT MICROSCOPE

CRANING MY NECK TO SPELL ABOVE ME

A DOLLS HOUSELITTLE EYOLF

WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN

UNSPEAKABLE FAIRY TALES EBB LIKE BLOOD THROUGH MY HEAD

AS I DIP THE PEN AND FOR AUNTS FOR ADMIRING FRIENDS

FOR YOU ABOVE ALL TO READ

COPY MY PRAISED AND SEDULOUS LINES.

BEHIND THE TWO OF US THIRSTY SPINES

QUIVER IN SEMI-SHADOW HUGE LEAVES UNCURL AND THICKEN.

1960

DOUBLE MONOLOGUE

TO LIVE ILLUSIONLESS IN THE ABANDONED MINE-

SHAFT OF DOUBT AND STILL

MIME ILLUSIONS FOR OTHERS? A PUZZLE

FOR THE MAKER WHO HAS THOUGHT

ONCE TOO OFTEN TOO COLDLY.

SINCE I WAS MORE THAN A CHILD

TRYING ON A THOUSAND FACES

I HAVE WANTED ONE THING: TO KNOW

SIMPLY AS I KNOW MY NAME

AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT WHERE I STAND.

HOW MUCH EXPENSE OF TIME AND SKILL

WHICH MIGHT HAVE SET ITSELF

TO ANGELIC FABRICATIONS! ALL MERELY

TO CHART ONE NEEDLE IN THE HAYMOW?

FIND YOURSELF AND YOU FIND THE WORLD?

SOLEMN PRESUMPTION! MIGHTY OBJECT

NO ONE BUT ITSELF HAS MISSED

WHAT’S LOST IF YOU STAY LOST? SOMEONE

IGNORANTLY LOVES YOU—WILL THAT SERVE?

SHRUG THAT OFF AND PRESTO!—

THE NEEDLE DROWNS IN THE HAYDUST.

THINK OF THE WHOLE HAYSTACK—

A COMPOSITION SO FORTUITOUS

IT ONLY LOOKS MONUMENTAL.

THERE’S ALWAYS A STRAW TWITCHING SOMEWHERE.

WAIT OUT THE LONG CHANCE AND

YOUR NEEDLE TOO COULD GET NUDGED UP

TO THE APEX OF THAT BRISTLING CALM.

RUSTED POSSIBLY. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT

TO SWEAR IT WAS THE OBJECT AFTER ALL.

TIME WEARS US OLD UTOPIANS.

I NOW NO LONGER THINK

“TRUTH” IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WORDS.

TODAY WHEN I SEE “TRUTHFUL”

WRITTEN SOMEWHERE IT FLARES

LIKE A WHITE ORCHID IN WET WOODS

RARE AND GRIEF-DELIGHTING UP FROM THE PAGE.

SOMETIMES UNWITTINGLY EVEN

WE HAVE BEEN TRUTHFUL.

IN A RANDOM UNIVERSE WHAT MORE

EXACT AND STARRY CONSOLATION?

DON’T THINK I THINK

FACTS SERVE BETTER THAN IGNORANT LOVE.

BOTH SERVE AND STILL

OUR NEED MOCKS OUR GEAR.

1960

A WOMAN MOURNED BY DAUGHTERS

NOW NOT A TEAR BEGUN

WE SIT HERE IN YOUR KITCHEN

SPENT YOU SEE ALREADY.

YOU ARE SWOLLEN TILL YOU STRAIN

THIS HOUSE AND THE WHOLE SKY.

YOU WHOM WE SO OFTEN

SUCCEEDED IN IGNORING!

YOU ARE PUFFED UP IN DEATH

LIKE A CORPSE PULLED FROM THE SEA;

WE GROAN BENEATH YOUR WEIGHT.

AND YET YOU WERE A LEAF

A STRAW BLOWN ON THE BED

YOU HAD LONG SINCE BECOME

CRISP AS A DEAD INSECT.

WHAT IS IT IF NOT YOU

THAT SETTLES ON US NOW

LIKE SATIN YOU PULLED DOWN

OVER OUR BRIDAL HEADS?

WHAT RISES IN OUR THROATS

LIKE FOOD YOU PRODDED IN?

NOTHING COULD BE ENOUGH.

YOU BREATHE UPON US NOW

THROUGH SOLID ASSERTIONS

OF YOURSELF: TEASPOONS GOBLETS

SEAS OF CARPET A FOREST

OF OLD PLANTS TO BE WATERED

AN OLD MAN IN AN ADJOINING

ROOM TO BE TOUCHED AND FED.

AND ALL THIS UNIVERSE

DARES US TO LAY A FINGER

ANYWHERE SAVE EXACTLY

AS YOU WOULD WISH IT DONE.

1960

READINGS OF HISTORY

HE DELIGHTED IN RELATING THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN BORN

NEAR GIRGENTI IN A PLACE CALLED CHAOS DURING A RAGING

CHOLERA EPIDEMIC.

—DOMENICO VITTORINI THE DRAMA OF LUIGI PIRANDELLO

I. THE EVIL EYE

LAST NIGHT WE SAT WITH THE STEREOPTICON

LAUGHING AT GENRE VIEWS OF 1906

TILL SUDDENLY GAZING STRAIGHT INTO

THAT FRINGED AND TASSELED PARLOR WHERE THE VESTAL

SPURNS AN UNLIKELY SUITOR

WITH HAIRY-CRESTED PLANTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT

MY HEART SANK. IT WAS TERRIBLE.

I SMELLED THE MILDEW IN THOSE SWAGS OF PLUSH

DUST ON THE EYEPIECE BLOOMED TO FREAKS OF MOLD.

I KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT HOW DEAD THAT COUPLE WAS.

TODAY A FRESH CLEAN MORNING.

YOUR CAMERA STABS ME UNAWARES

RIGHT IN MY MORTAL PART.

A WOMB OF CELLULOID ALREADY

CONTAINS MY DOTAGE AND MY TOTAL ABSENCE.

II. THE CONFRONTATION

LUIGI PIRANDELLO

LOOKED LIKE AN OLD HISTORIAN

(OVAL HEAD TUFTED WHITE BEARD

NOT LEAST THE HUNGER

FOR RECONCILIATION IN HIS EYE).

FOR FOURTEEN YEARS FACING

HIS CRIMINAL REFLECTION

IN HIS WIFE’S GRAND GUIGNOL MIND

HE BUILT OVER AND OVER

THAT HALL OF MIRRORS

IN WHICH TO BE APPEARS

TO BE PERCEIVED.

THE PRESENT HOLDS YOU LIKE A RAVING WIFE

CLEVER AS THE MAD ARE CLEVER

DIGGING UP YOUR SECRET TRUTHS

FROM HER DISABLED GENIUS.

SHE KNOWS WHAT YOU HOPE

AND DARE NOT HOPE:

REMEMBERS

WHAT YOU’RE SICK

OF FORGETTING.

WHAT ARE YOU NOW

BUT WHAT YOU KNOW TOGETHER YOU AND SHE?

SHE WILL NOT LET YOU THINK.

IT IS IMPORTANT

TO MAKE CONNECTIONS. EVERYTHING

HAPPENS VERY FAST IN THE MINDS

OF THE INSANE. EVEN YOU

AREN’T UP TO THAT YET.

GO OUT WALK

THINK OF SELVES LONG PAST.

III. MEMORABILIA

I RECALL

CIVIL WAR LETTERS OF A GREAT-GRAND-UNCLE

FIFTEEN AT CHANCELLORSVILLE

NO RACONTEUR

NO SPELLER EITHER; NOR TO PUT IT SQUARELY

MUCH OF A MIND;

THE MOST WE GATHER

IS THAT HE DID WRITE HOME:

I AM WELL

HOW ARE MY SISTERS HOPE YOU ARE THE SAME.

DID SPARTAN BATTLE-ECHOES RACK HIS HEAD?

DYING HE TURNED INTO HIS FATHER’S MEMORY.

HISTORY’S QUEERLY STRONG PERFUMES

RISE FROM THE CROOK OF THIS DAY’S ELBOW:

SEDUCTION FANTASIES OF THE PUBLIC MIND

OR DILTHEY’S DREAM FROM WHICH HE ROUSED TO SEE

THE COSMOS GLARING THROUGH HIS WINDOWPANE?

PRISONERS OF WHAT WE THINK OCCURRED

OR DREAMERS DREAMING TOWARD A FINAL WORD?

WHAT IN FACT HAPPENED IN THESE WOODS

ON SOME OBLITERATED AFTERNOON?

IV. CONSANGUINITY

CAN HISTORY SHOW US NOTHING

BUT PIECES OF OURSELVES DETACHED

SET TO A KIND OF POETRY

A KIND OF MUSIC EVEN?

SEATED TODAY ON GRANDMAMMA’S

PLUSH SOFA WITH THE GRAPES

BURSTING SO RIPELY FROM THE CURVED MAHOGANY

WE READ THE GREAT VICTORIANS

WEEPING ALMOST AS IF

SOME FAMILY BREACH WERE HEALED.

THOSE ANGRY GIANTESSES AND GIANTS

LATELY OUR KITH AND KIN!

WE STARE INTO THEIR FACES HEAR

AT LAST WHAT THEY WERE SAYING

(OR SOME VERSION NOT BRUITED

BY FILIAL IRRITATION).

THE CAT-TAILS WITHER IN THE READING-ROOM.

TOBACCO-COLORED DUST

DRIFTS ON THE NEWEST MAGAZINES.

I LOAF HERE LEAFING ANCIENT COPIES

OF LIFE FROM WORLD WAR II.

WE LOOK SO POOR AND HONEST THERE:

GIRLS WITH LONG HAIR BADLY COMBED

AND UNBECOMING DRESSES—

WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

YOU SAIL

TO SHOP IN EUROPE IGNORANTLY FREED

FOR YOU AN AGE AGO.

YOUR NYLON LUGGAGE MATCHES

EYELIDS

EXPERTLY AZURED.

I TOO HAVE LIVED IN HISTORY.

V. THE MIRROR

IS IT IN HOPES

TO FIND OR LOSE MYSELF

THAT I

FILL UP MY TABLE NOW

WITH MICHELET AND MOTLEY?

TO “KNOW HOW IT WAS”

OR TO FORGET HOW IT IS—

WHAT ELSE?

SPLIT AT THE ROOT NEITHER GENTILE NOR JEW

YANKEE NOR REBEL BORN

IN THE FACE OF TWO ANCIENT CULTS

I’M A GOOD READER OF HISTORIES.

AND YOU

MORRIS COHEN DEAR TO ME AS A BROTHER

WHEN YOU SIT AT NIGHT

TRACING YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR VOLUMES

OF JOSEPHUS OR ANY

OF THE OLD JUDAIC CHRONICLES

DO YOU FIND YOURSELF THERE A SIMPLER

MORE ELOQUENT JEW?

OR DO YOU READ

TO SHUT OUT THE TICK-TOCK OF SELF

THE QUESTIONS AND THEIR ROUTINE ANSWERS?

VI. THE COVENANT

THE PRESENT BREAKS OUR HEARTS. WE LIE AND FREEZE

OUR FINGERS ICY AS A BUNCH OF KEYS.

NOTHING WILL THAW THESE BONES EXCEPT

MEMORY LIKE AN ANCIENT BLANKET WRAPPED

ABOUT US WHEN WE SLEEP AT HOME AGAIN

SMELLING OF PICNICS CLOSETS SICKNESSES

OLD NIGHTMARE

AND INSOMNIA’S SPREADING STAIN.

OR SAY I SIT WITH WHAT I HALFWAY KNOW

AS WITH A DYING MAN WHO HEAVES THE TRUE

VERSION AT LAST NOW THAT IT HARDLY MATTERS

OR GROPES A HAND TO WHERE THE LETTERS

SEWN IN THE MATTRESS CAN BE PLUCKED AND READ.

HERE’S WATER.SLEEP.NO MORE IS ASKED OF YOU.

I TAKE YOUR LIFE INTO MY LIVING HEAD.

1960

TO THE AIRPORT

DEATH’S TAXI CRACKLES THROUGH THE MIST. THE CHEEKS

OF DIAMOND BATTLEMENTS FLUSH HIGH AND COLD.

ALARM CLOCKS STRIKE A MILLION SPARKS OF WILL.

WEEPING:ALL NIGHT WE’VE WEPT AND WATCHED THE HOURS

THAT NEVER WILL BE OURS AGAIN: NOW

WEEPING WE ROLL THROUGH UNFORGETTABLE

ZION THAT REARS ITS GOLDEN HEAD FROM SLEEP

TO ACT AND DOES NOT NEED US AS WE WEEP.

YOU DREAMED US CITY AND YOU LET US BE.

GRANDILOQUENCE IMPROVIDENCE ORDURE LIGHT

HOURS THAT SEEMED YEARS AND OURS—AND OVER ALL

THE ENDLESS WING OF POSSIBILITY

THAT MACKEREL HEAVEN OF YOURS FRETTED WITH ALL

OUR WITS COULD LEAP FOR ENVY BATTEN ON.

OUR FLIGHTS TAKE OFF FROM YOU INTO THE SEA;

NOTHING YOU NEED WASTES THOUGH WE THINK WE DO.

YOU ARE CANAAN NOW AND WE ARE LIFTED HIGH

TO SEE ALL WE WERE PROMISED NEVER KNEW.

1960

THE AFTERWAKE

NURSING YOUR NERVES

TO REST I’VE ROUSED MY OWN; WELL

NOW FOR A FEW BAD HOURS!

SLEEP SEES YOU BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

ALONE I SLUMP IN HIS FRONT PARLOR.

YOU’RE SAFE INSIDE. GOOD. BUT I’M

LIKE A MIDWIFE WHO AT DAWN

HAS ALL IN ORDER: BLOODSTAINS

WASHED UP TEAPOT ON THE STOVE

AND STARTS HER FIVE MILES HOME

WALKING THE BIRTHYELL STILL

EXPLODING IN HER HEAD.

YES I’M WITH HER NOW: HERE’S

THE STREAKED LIVID ROAD

EDGED WITH SHUT HOUSES

BREATHING NIGHT OUT AND IN.

LEGS TIGHT WITH FATIGUE

WE MOVE UNDER MORNING’S COAL-BLUE STAR

COLOSSAL AS THIS LOAD

OF UNEXPIRED PURPOSE WHICH DRAINS

SLOWLY TILL SCISSORS OF COCKCROW SNIP THE AIR.

1961

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

TO GPS

OVER THE CHESSBOARD NOW

YOUR ARTIFICIALITY CONCLUDES

A FINAL CHECK; RESTS; BROODS—

NO—SORTS AND STACKS A FILE OF MEMORIES

WHILE I

CONCEDE THE VICTORY BOW

AND SLOUCH AMONG MY FREE ASSOCIATIONS.

YOU NEVER HAD A MOTHER

LET’S SAY? NO DIGITAL GERTRUDE

WHOM YOU’D AS LIEF HAVE SEEN

KINGLESS? SO YOUR WHITE QUEEN

WAS JUST AN “OPERATOR.”

(MY RED HAD INCANDESCENCE

IRE AURA FLARE

AND TRAPPED ME SEVERAL MOMENTS IN HER STARE.)

I’M SULKING CLEARLY IN THE GREAT TRADITION

OF HUMAN WASTE. WHY NOT

DUMP THE WHOLE REEKING SNARL

AND LET YOU SOLVE ME ONCE FOR ALL?

(PARAMETER: A BLACK-FACED LUDDITE

ITCHING FOR ECSTASIES OF SABOTAGE.)

STILL WHEN

THEY MAKE YOU WRITE YOUR POEMS LATER ON

WHO’D ENVY YOU FORCE-FED

ON ALL THOSE VARIORUM

EDITIONS OF OUR PRIMITIVE ENDEAVORS

THOSE FROZEN PEMMICAN LANGUAGE-RATIONS

THEY’LL CRAM YOU WITH? DENIED

OUR LUXURY OF NAUSEA YOU

FORGET NOTHING HAVE NO DREAMS.

1961

A MARRIAGE IN THE ’SIXTIES

AS SOLID-SEEMING AS ANTIQUITY

YOU FROWN ABOVE

THE NEW YORK SUNDAY TIMES

WHERE CASTRO LIKE A WALK-ON OUT OF CARMEN

MUTTERS INTO A BEARDED HENCHMAN’S EAR.

THEY SAY THE SECOND’S GETTING SHORTER—

I KNEW IT IN MY BONES—

AND PIECES OF THE UNIVERSE ARE MISSING.

I FEEL THE GEARS OF THIS LATE AFTERNOON

SLIP COG BY COG EVEN AS I READ.

“I’M OLD” WE BOTH COMPLAIN

HALF-LAUGHING OFTENER NOW.

TIME SERVES YOU WELL. THAT FACE—

PART ROMAN EMPEROR PART RAIMU—

NOTHING THIS SIDE OF ABSENCE CAN UNDO.

BLISS REVULSION YOUR RARE ANGERS CAN

ONLY CARRY THROUGH WHAT’S WELL BEGUN.

WHEN

I READ YOUR LETTERS LONG AGO

IN THAT HALF-DEFUNCT

HOTEL IN MAGDALEN STREET

EVERY WORD PRIMED MY NERVES.

A GEOGRAPHICAL MISERY

COMPOSED OF OCEANS FOGBOUND PLANES

AND MISDELIVERED CABLEGRAMS

LAY ROUND ME A NOVA ZEMBLA

ONLY YOUR LIVE BREATH COULD UNFREEZE.

TODAY WE STALK

IN THE RAGING DESERT OF OUR THOUGHT

WHOSE SINGLE DROP OF MERCY IS

EACH KNOWS THE OTHER THERE.

TWO STRANGERS THRUST FOR LIFE UPON A ROCK

MAY HAVE AT LAST THE PERFECT HOUR OF TALK

THAT LANGUAGE ACHES FOR; STILL—

TWO MINDS TWO MESSAGES.

YOUR BROWS KNIT INTO FLOURISHES. SOME PIECE

OF MERE TIME HAS YOU TANGLED THERE.

SOME MOTE OF HISTORY HAS FLOWN INTO YOUR EYE.

WILL NOTHING EVER BE THE SAME

EVEN OUR QUARRELS TAKE A DIFFERENT KEY

OUR DREAMS EXHUME NEW METAPHORS?

THE WORLD BREATHES UNDERNEATH OUR BED.

DON’T LOOK. WE’RE AT EACH OTHER’S MERCY TOO.

DEAR FELLOW-PARTICLE ELECTRIC DUST

I’M BLOWN WITH—ANCESTOR

TO WHAT EUPHORIC CLUSTER—

SEE HOW PARTICULARITY DISSOLVES

IN ALL THAT HINTS OF CHAOS. LET ONE FINGER

HOVER TOWARD YOU FROM THERE

AND SEE THIS FURIOUS GRAIN

SUSPEND ITS DANCE TO HANG

BESIDE YOU LIKE YOUR TWIN.

1961

FIRST THINGS

I CAN’T NAME LOVE NOW

WITHOUT NAMING ITS OBJECT—

THIS THE FINAL MEASURE

OF THOSE FLINTSPARK YEARS

WHEN ONE BELIEVED

ONE’S FLASH INNATE.

TODAY I SWEAR

ONLY IN THE SUN’S EYE

DO I TAKE FIRE.

1961

ATTENTION

THE ICE AGE IS HERE.

I SIT BURNING CIGARETTES

BURNING MY BRAIN.

A MICRO-TIBET

DEADLY FRIVOLOUS COMPLETE

BLINDS THE FOUR PANES.

VEILS OF DUMB AIR

UNWIND LIKE BANDAGES

FROM MY LIPS

HALF-PARTED STEADY AS THE MOUTHS

OF ANTIQUE STATUES.

1961

END OF AN ERA

THIS MORNING FLAKES OF SUN

PEEL DOWN TO THE LAST SNOWHOLDS

THE BARBED-WIRE LEAVINGS OF A WAR

LOST WON IN THESE DEAD-END ALLEYS.

STALE AS A WRITTEN-OUT JOURNALIST

I SORT MY GEAR.—NOTHING IS HAPPENING.—CITY

DUMB AS A PACK OF THUMBED CARDS YOU

ONCE HAD SNAP AND GLARE

AND SECRET LIFE; NOW TREMBLING

UNDER MY FIVE GREY SENSES’ WEIGHT

YOU FLATTEN

ONTO THE TABLE.

BAUDELAIRE I THINK OF YOU … NOTHING CHANGES

RUDE AND SELF-ABSORBED THE CURRENT

DASHES PAST REFLECTING NOTHING POETRY

EXTENDS ITS UNSOUGHT AMNESTY

THE ROOTS OF THE GREAT GROVE

ATROPHY UNDERGROUND.

SOME VOICES THOUGH SHAKE IN THE AIR LIKE HEAT.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS CHANGING

EVEN THE NEIGHBORS ARE GROWN METHINKS PECULIAR.

I WALK INTO MY HOUSE AND SEE

TOURISTS FINGERING THIS AND THAT.

MY MIRRORS MY BRIC-À-BRAC

DON’T SUIT THEIR STYLE.

THOSE OLD FRIENDS THOUGH

ALIVE AND DEAD

FOR WHOM THINGS DON’T COME EASY—

CERTAIN FORESTS ARE SAWDUST

FROM NOW ON HAVE TO BE DESCRIBED?

NOTHING CHANGES. THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTHS

ARE STILL IN THE EARTH.

1961

RUSTICATION

IN A GIGANTIC POT DE CHAMBRE SCROLLED

WITH ROSES PURCHASED DEARLY AT AUCTION

GOLDENROD AND ASTERS SPILL

TOWARD THE INEVITABLE SUNSET.

THE HOUSEGUESTS TRAIL FROM SWIMMING

UNDER HUGE TOWELS.

MARIANNE DANGLES BAREFOOT IN THE HAMMOCK

READING ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING.

VIVALDI RATTLES ON THE PHONOGRAPH

FLUTES RICOCHETING OFF THE BIRCHTREES.

FLIES BUZZ AND ARE GAILY MURDERED.

STILL OUT OF IT AND GUILTY

I GLUE THE DISTANCE-GLASSES TO MY EYES

OSTRICH-LIKE HOPING

YOU’LL THINK ME IN THAT CLEARING HALF A MILE AWAY.

OFFSTAGE I HEAR

THE OLD TIME-KILLERS DRESSING BANGING DOORS

YOUR VOICE A TIMBRE OR TWO TOO RICH FOR LOVE

CHEERING THEM ON.

A KESTREL SAILS INTO MY FIELD OF VISION

CLEAR AS A RISING STAR.

WHY SHOULD I NEED TO QUARREL

WITH ANOTHER’S CONSOLATIONS?

WHY IN YOUR MORTAL SKIN

VIGOROUSLY SMASHING ICE AND SMOKING

A GRAYING PIGTAIL DOWN YOUR BACK

SHOULD YOU SEEM INFAMOUS TO ME?

1961

APOLOGY

I’VE SAID: I WOULDN’T EVER

KEEP A CAT A DOG

A BIRD—

CHIEFLY BECAUSE

I’D RATHER LOVE MY EQUALS.

TODAY TURNING

IN THE FOG OF MY MIND

I KNEW THE THING I REALLY

COULDN’T STAND IN THE HOUSE

IS A WOMAN

WITH A MINDFUL OF FOG

AND BLOODLETTING CLAWS

AND THE NERVES OF A BIRD

AND THE NIGHTMARES OF A DOG.

1961

SISTERS

CAN I EASILY SAY

I KNOW YOU OF COURSE NOW

NO LONGER THE FELLOW-VICTIM

READER OF MY DIARIES HEIR

TO MY OUTGROWN DRESSES

EAR FOR MY POEMS AND INVECTIVES?

DO I KNOW YOU BETTER

THAN THAT BLUE-EYED STRANGER

SELF-ABSORBED AS MYSELF

RAPTLY KNITTING OR SLEEPING

THROUGH A THIRDCLASS WINTER JOURNEY?

FACE TO FACE ALL NIGHT

HER DREAMS AND WHIMPERS

TANGLED WITH MINE

SLEEPING BUT NOT ASLEEP

BEHIND THE ENGINE DRILLING

INTO DARK GERMANY

HER EYES MOUTH HEAD

RECONSTRUCTED BY DAWN

AS WE NODDED FAREWELL.

HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE

YEARS LATER ANYWHERE.

1961

IN THE NORTH

MULISH UNREGENERATE

NOT “AS ALL MEN ARE”

BUT MORE THAN MOST

YOU SIT UP THERE IN THE SUNSET;

THERE ARE ONLY THREE

HOURS OF DARK

IN YOUR NIGHT. YOU ARE

ALONE AS AN OLD KING

WITH HIS WHITE-GOLD BEARD

WHEN IN SUMMER THE SHIPS

SAIL OUT THE HEROES

SINGING PUSH OFF

FOR OTHER LANDS. ONLY

IN WINTER WHEN

TRAPPED IN THE ICE

YOUR KINGDOM FLASHES

UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

AND THE BEES DREAM

IN THEIR HIVES THE YOUNG

MEN LIKE THE BEES

HANG NEAR YOU

FOR LACK OF ANOTHER

REMEMBERING TOO WITH SOME

REMORSEFUL TENDERNESS

YOU ARE THEIR KING.

1962

THE CLASSMATE

ONE YEAR YOU GAVE US

ALL NAMES HUDIBRASTIC

TITLES SKYWROTE

OUR GAUDY HISTORIES.

WE WERE ALL SPARKS

STRUCK IN YOUR HEAD

WE MOCKED BUT LISTENED.

YOU FILLED A WHOLE

ZOOLOGICAL NOTEBOOK

WITH SLY GENERATIONS

OF SHOULD-HAVE-BEENS

WERE DISGRACED NOT DISTRESSED.

OUR HOWLS DIED AWAY.

YOUR POETRY WAS IN

PAPER-DART BALLADS

SAILING BEYOND OUR NOSES

IN BLACKBOARD LYRICS

SCRAWLED IN OUR OWN PATOIS

SPIRALS OF CHALKDUST

INKBLOT MANIFESTOS

WHO COULD READ TODAY?

YOU LESS THAN ANY.

BECAUSE LATER YOU TURNED

TO ADMIRATION OF THE CLASSICS

AND A SEDULOUS EAR.

STILL IF I HEAR

THE SLASH OF FEET

THROUGH GUTTERS FULL OF OAKLEAVES

AND SEE THE BOYS

STILL UNPRIZED UNPRIZING

DANCING ALONG TOSSING

BOOKS AND DUSTY LEAVES

INTO THE SUN

THEY CHANT IT WOULD SEEM

YOUR MOMENTARY QUATRAINS

NOSE-THUMBING FREE-LANCING

POET OF THE SCHOOLYARD—

PRIZE-GIVER AND TAKER

NOW A PILLAR

SWADDLED IN LAURELS—

LOST CLASSMATE LOOK!

YOUR GLORY WAS HERE.

1962

PEELING ONIONS

ONLY TO HAVE A GRIEF

EQUAL TO ALL THESE TEARS!

THERE’S NOT A SOB IN MY CHEST.

DRY-HEARTED AS PEER GYNT

I PARE AWAY NO HERO

MERELY A COOK.

CRYING WAS LABOR ONCE

WHEN I’D GOOD CAUSE.

WALKING I FELT MY EYES LIKE WOUNDS

RAW IN MY HEAD

SO POSTAL-CLERKS I THOUGHT MUST STARE.

A DOG’S LOOK A CAT’S BURNT TO MY BRAIN—

YET ALL THAT STAYED

STUFFED IN MY LUNGS LIKE SMOG.

THESE OLD TEARS IN THE CHOPPING-BOWL.

1961

GHOST OF A CHANCE

YOU SEE A MAN

TRYING TO THINK.

YOU WANT TO SAY

TO EVERYTHING:

KEEP OFF! GIVE HIM ROOM!

BUT YOU ONLY WATCH

TERRIFIED

THE OLD CONSOLATIONS

WILL GET HIM AT LAST

LIKE A FISH

HALF-DEAD FROM FLOPPING

AND ALMOST CRAWLING

ACROSS THE SHINGLE

ALMOST BREATHING

THE RAW AGONIZING

AIR

TILL A WAVE

PULLS IT BACK BLIND INTO THE TRIUMPHANT

SEA.

1962

THE WELL

DOWN THIS OLD WELL

WHAT LEAVES HAVE FALLEN

WHAT CORES OF EATEN APPLES

WHAT SCRAPS OF PAPER!

AN OLD TRASH BARREL.

NOVEMBER NO ONE COMES.

BUT I COME TRYING

TO BREATHE THAT WORD

INTO THE WELL’S EAR

WHICH COULD MAKE THE LEAVES FLY UP

LIKE A GREEN JET

TO CLOTHE THE NAKED TREE

THE WHOLE FRUIT LEAP TO THE BOUGH

THE SCRAPS LIKE FLEETS OF LETTERS

SAIL UP INTO MY HANDS.

LEIDEN 1961

NOVELLA

TWO PEOPLE IN A ROOM SPEAKING HARSHLY.

ONE GETS UP GOES OUT TO WALK.

(THAT IS THE MAN.)

THE OTHER GOES INTO THE NEXT ROOM

AND WASHES THE DISHES CRACKING ONE.

(THAT IS THE WOMAN.)

IT GETS DARK OUTSIDE.

THE CHILDREN QUARREL IN THE ATTIC.

SHE HAS NO BLOOD LEFT IN HER HEART.

THE MAN COMES BACK TO A DARK HOUSE.

THE ONLY LIGHT IS IN THE ATTIC.

HE HAS FORGOTTEN HIS KEY.

HE RINGS AT HIS OWN DOOR

AND HEARS SOBBING ON THE STAIRS.

THE LIGHTS GO ON IN THE HOUSE.

THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM.

OUTSIDE SEPARATE AS MINDS

THE STARS TOO COME ALIGHT.

1962

FACE

I COULD LOOK AT YOU A LONG TIME

MAN OF RED AND BLUE;

YOUR EYE GLOWS MOCKINGLY

FROM THE RAINBOW-COLORED FLESH

KAREL APPEL CLOTHED YOU IN.

YOU ARE A FISH

DRAWN UP DRIPPING HUGELY

FROM THE SEA OF PAINT

LAID ON THE CANVAS

TO GLOWER AND FLASH

OUT OF THE BLACKNESS

THAT IS YOUR TRUE ELEMENT

1962

PROSPECTIVE
IMMIGRANTS
PLEASE NOTE

EITHER YOU WILL

GO THROUGH THIS DOOR

OR YOU WILL NOT GO THROUGH.

IF YOU GO THROUGH

THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK

OF REMEMBERING YOUR NAME.

THINGS LOOK AT YOU DOUBLY

AND YOU MUST LOOK BACK

AND LET THEM HAPPEN.

IF YOU DO NOT GO THROUGH

IT IS POSSIBLE

TO LIVE WORTHILY

TO MAINTAIN YOUR ATTITUDES

TO HOLD YOUR POSITION

TO DIE BRAVELY

BUT MUCH WILL BLIND YOU

MUCH WILL EVADE YOU

AT WHAT COST WHO KNOWS?

THE DOOR ITSELF

MAKES NO PROMISES.

IT IS ONLY A DOOR.

1962

LIKENESS

A GOOD MAN

IS AN ODD THING:

HARD TO FIND

AS THE SONG SAYS

HE IS ANARCHIC

AS A MOUNTAIN FRESHET

AND UNPROTECTED

BY THE PROTECTORS.

1962

THE LAG

WITH YOU IT IS STILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

NOTHING I KNOW WILL MAKE YOU KNOW

WHAT BIRDS CRIED ME AWAKE

OR HOW THE WET LIGHT LEAKED

INTO MY SKY.

DAY CAME AS NO CLEAR VICTORY

IT’S RAINING STILL BUT LIGHT

WASHES THE MENACE FROM OBSCURE FORMS

AND IN THE SHAVING MIRROR THERE’S

A FACE I RECOGNIZE.

WITH YOU IT IS STILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

YOU HUG YOURSELF TIGHTENED AS IN A BERTH

SUSPENDED OVER THE GRAND BANKS

WHERE TIME IS ALREADY AMERICAN

AND HANGING FIRE.

I’M OLDER NOW THAN YOU.

I FEEL YOUR BLACK DREAMS STRUGGLING AT A PORTHOLE

STUFFED FULL OF NIGHT. I FEEL YOU CHOKING

IN THAT THICK PLACE. MY WORDS

REACH YOU AS THROUGH A TELEPHONE

WHERE SOME SUBMARINE ECHO OF MY VOICE

BLURTS KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN’T USE.

1962

ALWAYS THE SAME

SLOWLY PROMETHEUS

BLEEDS TO LIFE

IN HIS HUGE LONELINESS.

YOU FOR WHOM

HIS BOWELS ARE EXPOSED

GO ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS

DYING A LITTLE EVERY DAY

FROM THE INSIDE OUT

ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY

TILL THE LATE DECADES WHEN

WOMEN GO HYSTERICAL

AND MEN ARE DUMBLY FRIGHTENED

AND FAR AWAY LIKE THE SEA

PROMETHEUS SINGS ON

“LIKE A BATTLE-SONG AFTER A BATTLE.”

1962

PEACE

LASHES OF WHITE LIGHT

BINDING ANOTHER HAILCLOUD—

THE WHOLE ONSET ALL OVER

BURSTING AGAINST OUR FACES

SPUTTERING LIKE DEAD HOLLY

FIRED IN A GRATE:

AND THE BIRDS GO MAD

POTTED BY GRAPESHOT

WHILE THE SUN SHINES

IN ONE QUARTER OF HEAVEN

AND THE RAINBOW

BREAKS OUT ITS ENORMOUS FLAG—

OILY UNNEGOTIABLE—

OVER THE SACK-DRAPED BACKS

OF THE CATTLE IN THEIR KINGDOM.

1961

THE ROOFWALKER

FOR DENISE LEVERTOV

OVER THE HALF-FINISHED HOUSES

NIGHT COMES. THE BUILDERS

STAND ON THE ROOF. IT IS

QUIET AFTER THE HAMMERS

THE PULLEYS HANG SLACK.

GIANTS THE ROOFWALKERS

ON A LISTING DECK THE WAVE

OF DARKNESS ABOUT TO BREAK

ON THEIR HEADS. THE SKY

IS A TORN SAIL WHERE FIGURES

PASS MAGNIFIED SHADOWS

ON A BURNING DECK.

I FEEL LIKE THEM UP THERE:

EXPOSED LARGER THAN LIFE

AND DUE TO BREAK MY NECK.

WAS IT WORTH WHILE TO LAY—

WITH INFINITE EXERTION—

A ROOF I CAN’T LIVE UNDER?

—ALL THOSE BLUEPRINTS

CLOSINGS OF GAPS

MEASURINGS CALCULATIONS?

A LIFE I DIDN’T CHOOSE

CHOSE ME: EVEN

MY TOOLS ARE THE WRONG ONES

FOR WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

I’M NAKED IGNORANT

A NAKED MAN FLEEING

ACROSS THE ROOFS

WHO COULD WITH A SHADE OF DIFFERENCE

BE SITTING IN THE LAMPLIGHT

AGAINST THE CREAM WALLPAPER

READING—NOT WITH INDIFFERENCE—

ABOUT A NAKED MAN

FLEEING ACROSS THE ROOFS.

1961

AT THE JEWISH NEW YEAR

FOR MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS

THIS CALM SEPTEMBER DAY

WITH YELLOW IN THE LEAF

HAS LAIN IN THE KERNEL OF TIME

WHILE THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE WALLS

HAS HAD ITS TURBULENT SAY

AND HISTORY LIKE A LONG

SNAKE HAS CRAWLED ON ITS WAY

AND IS CRAWLING ONWARD STILL.

AND WE HAVE LITTLE TO TELL

ON THIS OR ANY FEAST

EXCEPT OF THE TERRIBLE PAST.

FIVE THOUSAND YEARS ARE CAST

DOWN BEFORE THE WONDERING CHILD

WHO MUST EXPIATE THEM ALL.

SOME OF US HAVE REPLIED

IN THE BITTERNESS OF YOUTH

OR THE QUALMS OF MIDDLE-AGE:

“IF TIME IS UNSATISFIED

AND ALL OUR FATHERS HAVE SUFFERED

CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH

WHY THEN WE CHOOSE TO FORGET.

LET OUR FORGETTING BEGIN

WITH THOSE AGE-OLD ARGUMENTS

IN WHICH THEIR MINDS WERE WOUND

LIKE MUSTY PHYLACTERIES;

AND WE CHOOSE TO FORGET AS WELL

THOSE CHERISHED HISTORIES

THAT MADE OUR OLD MEN FOND

AND ALREADY ARE STRANGE TO US.

“OR LET US BEING TODAY

TOO RATIONAL TO CRY OUT

OR TRAMPLE UNDERFOOT

WHAT AFTER ALL PRESERVES

A CERTAIN SAVOR YET—

THOUGH TORN UP BY THE ROOTS—

LET US MAKE OUR COMPROMISE

WITH THE TERROR AND THE GUILT

AND VIEW AS CURIOUS RELICS

ONCE FOUND IN DAILY USE

THE MYTHOLOGY THE NAMES

THAT HOWEVER TIME HAS CORRUPTED

THEIR ANCIENT PURITY

STILL BURN LIKE YELLOW FLAMES

BUT THEIR FIRE IS NOT FOR US.”

AND YET HOWEVER WE CHOOSE

TO DENY OR TO REMEMBER

THOUGH ON THE CALENDARS

WE WAKE AND SUFFER BY

THIS DAY IS MERELY ONE

OF THIRTY IN SEPTEMBER—

IN THE KERNEL OF THE MIND

THE NEW YEAR MUST RENEW

THIS DAY AS FOR OUR KIND

OVER FIVE THOUSAND YEARS

THE TASK OF BEING OURSELVES.

WHATEVER WE STRAIN TO FORGET

OUR MEMORY MUST BE LONG.

MAY THE TASTE OF HONEY LINGER

UNDER THE BITTEREST TONGUE.

1955

MOVING IN WINTER

THEIR LIFE COLLAPSED LIKE UNPLAYED CARDS

IS CARRIED PIECEMEAL THROUGH THE SNOW:

HEADBOARD AND FOOTBOARD NOW THE BED

WHERE SHE HAS LAIN DESIRING HIM

WHERE OVERHEAD HIS SLEEP WILL BUILD

ITS CANOPY TO SMOTHER HER ONCE MORE;

THEIR TABLE BY FOUR ELBOWS WORN

EVENING AFTER EVENING WHILE THE WAX RUNS DOWN;

MIRRORS GREY WITH REFLECTING THEM

BUREAUS COFFINING FROM THE COLD

THINGS THAT CAN SHUFFLE IN A DRAWER

CARPETS ROLLED UP AROUND THOSE ECHOES

WHICH SHAKEN OUT TAKE WING AND BREED

NEW ALTERCATIONS THE OLD SILENCES.

1957

NECESSITIES OF LIFE

PIECE BY PIECE I SEEM

TO RE-ENTER THE WORLD: I FIRST BEGAN

A SMALL FIXED DOT STILL SEE

THAT OLD MYSELF A DARK-BLUE THUMBTACK

PUSHED INTO THE SCENE

A HARD LITTLE HEAD PROTRUDING

FROM THE POINTILLIST’S BUZZ AND BLOOM.

AFTER A TIME THE DOT

BEGINS TO OOZE. CERTAIN HEATS

MELT IT.

NOW I WAS HURRIEDLY

BLURRING INTO RANGES

OF BURNT RED BURNING GREEN

WHOLE BIOGRAPHIES SWAM UP AND

SWALLOWED ME LIKE JONAH.

JONAH! I WAS WITTGENSTEIN

MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT THE SOUL

OF LOUIS JOUVET DEAD

IN A BLOWN-UP PHOTOGRAPH.

TILL WOLFED ALMOST TO SHREDS

I LEARNED TO MAKE MYSELF

UNAPPETIZING. SCALY AS A DRY BULB

THROWN INTO A CELLAR

I USED MYSELF LET NOTHING USE ME.

LIKE BEING ON A PRIVATE DOLE

SOMETIMES MORE LIKE KNEADING BRICKS IN EGYPT.

WHAT LIFE WAS THERE WAS MINE

NOW AND AGAIN TO LAY

ONE HAND ON A WARM BRICK

AND TOUCH THE SUN’S GHOST

WITH ECONOMICAL JOY

NOW AND AGAIN TO NAME

OVER THE BARE NECESSITIES.

SO MUCH FOR THOSE DAYS. SOON

PRACTICE MAY MAKE ME MIDDLING-PERFECT I’LL

DARE INHABIT THE WORLD

TRENCHANT IN MOTION AS AN EEL SOLID

AS A CABBAGE-HEAD. I HAVE INVITATIONS:

A CURL OF MIST STEAMS UPWARD

FROM A FIELD VISIBLE AS MY BREATH

HOUSES ALONG A ROAD STAND WAITING

LIKE OLD WOMEN KNITTING BREATHLESS

TO TELL THEIR TALES.

1962

IN THE WOODS

“DIFFICULT ORDINARY HAPPINESS”

NO ONE NOWADAYS BELIEVES IN YOU.

I SHIFT FULL-LENGTH ON THE BLANKET

TO FIX THE SUN PRECISELY

BEHIND THE PINE-TREE’S CREST

SO LIGHT SPREADS THROUGH THE NEEDLES

ALIVE AS WATER JUST

WHERE A SNAKE HAS SURFACED

UNREAL AS WATER IN GREEN CRYSTAL.

BAD NEWS IS ALWAYS ARRIVING.

“WE’RE HIDERS HIDING FROM SOMETHING BAD”

SINGS THE LITTLE BOY.

WRITING THESE WORDS IN THE WOODS

I FEEL LIKE A TRAITOR TO MY FRIENDS

EVEN TO MY ENEMIES.

THE COMMON LOT’S TO DIE

A STRANGER’S DEATH AND LIE

ROUGED IN THE COFFIN IN A DRESS

CHOSEN BY THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

PERHAPS THAT’S WHY WE NEVER

SEE CLOCKS ON PUBLIC BUILDINGS ANY MORE.

A FACT NO ARCHITECT WILL MENTION.

WE’RE HIDERS HIDING FROM SOMETHING BAD

MOST OF THE TIME.

YET AND OUTRAGEOUSLY SOMETHING GOOD

FINDS US FOUND ME THIS MORNING

LYING ON A DUSTY BLANKET

AMONG THE BURNT-OUT INDIAN PIPES

AND BURSTING-OPEN LADY’S-SLIPPERS.

MY SOUL MY HELICOPTER WHIRRED

DISTANTLY BY HABIT OVER

THE OLD POND WITH THE HALF-DROWNED BOAT

TOWARD WHICH IT ALWAYS VEERS

FOR CONSOLATION: EGO’S ARCADY:

LEAVING THE BODY STUCK

LIKE A LEAF AGAINST A SCREEN.—

HAPPINESS! HOW MANY TIMES

I’VE STRANDED ON THAT WORD

AT THE EDGE OF THAT POND; SEEN

AS IF THROUGH TEARS THE DRAGON-FLY—

ONLY TO FIND IT ALL

GOING DIFFERENTLY FOR ONCE

THIS TIME: MY SOUL WHEELED BACK

AND BURST INTO MY BODY.

FOUND! READY OR NOT.

IF I MOVE NOW THE SUN

NAKED BETWEEN THE TREES

WILL MELT ME AS I LIE.

1963

THE CORPSE-PLANT

HOW DARE A SICK MAN OR AN OBEDIENT MAN WRITE POEMS?

—WHITMAN

A MILK-GLASS BOWL HANGING BY THREE CHAINS

FROM THE DISCOLORED CEILING

IS BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT. ON THE FLOOR LEAVES CRAYONS

INNOCENT DUST FOREGATHER.

NEITHER OBEDIENT NOR SICK I TURN MY HEAD

FEELING THE WEIGHT OF A THICK GOLD RING

IN EITHER LOBE. I SEE THE CORPSE-PLANTS

CLUSTERED IN A HOBNAILED TUMBLER

AT MY ELBOW WHITE AS DEATH I’D SAY

IF I’D EVER SEEN DEATH;

WHITER THAN LIFE

NEXT TO MY SUMMER-STAINED HAND.

IS IT IN THE SUN THAT TRUTH BEGINS?

LYING UNDER THAT BATTERING LIGHT

THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF SUMMER

I FELT SCRAPED CLEAN WASHED DOWN

TO IGNORANCE. THE GOLD IN MY EARS

SOUVENIR OF A SHREWD OLD CITY

MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEARING THIN AS WIRES

FOUND IN THE BONES OF A WOMAN’S HEAD

MIRACULOUSLY KEPT IN ITS ESSENTIALS

IN SOME HOT CRADLE-TOMB OF TIME.

I FELT MY BODY SLIPPING THROUGH

THE FINGERS OF ITS MIND.

LATER I SLID ON WET ROCKS

THREW MY SHOES ACROSS A BROOK

WADED ON ALGAE-FURRED STONES

TO JOIN THEM. THAT DAY I FOUND

THE CORPSE-PLANTS GROWING LIKE

SHADOWS ON A NEGATIVE

IN THE CHILL OF FERN AND LICHEN-RUST.

THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME

I GAVE THEM THEIR DEATHLY NAMES—

OR DID THEY NAME THEMSELVES?—

NOT “INDIAN PIPES” AS ONCE

WE CHILDREN KNEW THEM.

TONIGHT I THINK OF WINTER

WINTERS OF MIND OF FLESH

SICKNESS OF THE ROT-SMELL OF LEAVES

TURNED SILT-BLACK HEAVY AS TARPAULIN

OBEDIENCE OF THE ELEVATOR CAGE

LOWERING ITSELF CRANK BY CRANK

INTO THE MINE-PIT

FORCED LABOR FORCIBLY RENEWED—

BUT THE HORROR IS DIMMED:

LIKE THE NEGATIVE OF ONE

INTOLERABLE PHOTOGRAPH

IT BARELY SORTS ITSELF OUT

UNDER THE RADIANCE OF THE MILK-GLASS SHADE.

ONLY DEATH’S INSECT WHITENESS

CROOKS ITS NECK IN A TUMBLER

WHERE I PLACED ITS SIGN BY CHOICE.

1963

THE TREES

THE TREES INSIDE ARE MOVING OUT INTO THE FOREST

THE FOREST THAT WAS EMPTY ALL THESE DAYS

WHERE NO BIRD COULD SIT

NO INSECT HIDE

NO SUN BURY ITS FEET IN SHADOW

THE FOREST THAT WAS EMPTY ALL THESE NIGHTS

WILL BE FULL OF TREES BY MORNING.

ALL NIGHT THE ROOTS WORK

TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CRACKS

IN THE VERANDA FLOOR.

THE LEAVES STRAIN TOWARD THE GLASS

SMALL TWIGS STIFF WITH EXERTION

LONG-CRAMPED BOUGHS SHUFFLING UNDER THE ROOF

LIKE NEWLY DISCHARGED PATIENTS

HALF-DAZED MOVING

TO THE CLINIC DOORS.

I SIT INSIDE DOORS OPEN TO THE VERANDA

WRITING LONG LETTERS

IN WHICH I SCARCELY MENTION THE DEPARTURE

OF THE FOREST FROM THE HOUSE.

THE NIGHT IS FRESH THE WHOLE MOON SHINES

IN A SKY STILL OPEN

THE SMELL OF LEAVES AND LICHEN

STILL REACHES LIKE A VOICE INTO THE ROOMS.

MY HEAD IS FULL OF WHISPERS

WHICH TOMORROW WILL BE SILENT.

LISTEN. THE GLASS IS BREAKING.

THE TREES ARE STUMBLING FORWARD

INTO THE NIGHT. WINDS RUSH TO MEET THEM.

THE MOON IS BROKEN LIKE A MIRROR

ITS PIECES FLASH NOW IN THE CROWN

OF THE TALLEST OAK.

1963

LIKE THIS TOGETHER

FOR A.H.C.

1.

WIND ROCKS THE CAR.

WE SIT PARKED BY THE RIVER

SILENCE BETWEEN OUR TEETH.

BIRDS SCATTER ACROSS ISLANDS

OF BROKEN ICE. ANOTHER TIME

I’D HAVE SAID “CANADA GEESE”

KNOWING YOU LOVE THEM.

A YEAR TEN YEARS FROM NOW

I’LL REMEMBER THIS—

THIS SITTING LIKE DRUGGED BIRDS

IN A GLASS CASE—

NOT WHY ONLY THAT WE

WERE HERE LIKE THIS TOGETHER.

2.

THEY’RE TEARING DOWN TEARING UP

THIS CITY BLOCK BY BLOCK.

ROOMS CUT IN HALF

HANG LIKE FLAYED CARCASSES

THEIR OLD ROSES IN RAGS

FAMOUS STREETS HAVE FORGOTTEN

WHERE THEY WERE GOING. ONLY

A FACT COULD BE SO DREAMLIKE.

THEY’RE TEARING DOWN THE HOUSES

WE MET AND LIVED IN

SOON OUR TWO BODIES WILL BE ALL

LEFT STANDING FROM THAT ERA.

3.

WE HAVE AS THEY SAY

CERTAIN THINGS IN COMMON.

I MEAN: A VIEW

FROM A BATHROOM WINDOW

OVER SLATE TO STIFF PIGEONS

HUDDLED EVERY MORNING; THE WAY

WATER TASTES FROM OUR TAP

WHICH YOU MARVEL AT LETTING

IT SPLASH INTO THE GLASS.

BECAUSE OF YOU I NOTICE

THE TASTE OF WATER

A LUXURY I MIGHT

OTHERWISE HAVE MISSED.

4.

OUR WORDS MISUNDERSTAND US.

SOMETIMES AT NIGHT

YOU ARE MY MOTHER:

OLD DETAILED GRIEFS

TWITCH AT MY DREAMS AND I

CRAWL AGAINST YOU FIGHTING

FOR SHELTER MAKING YOU

MY CAVE. SOMETIMES

YOU’RE THE WAVE OF BIRTH

THAT DROWNS ME IN MY FIRST

NIGHTMARE. I SUCK THE AIR.

MISCARRIED KNOWLEDGE TWISTS US

LIKE HOT SHEETS THROWN ASKEW.

5.

DEAD WINTER DOESN’T DIE

IT WEARS AWAY A PIECE OF CARRION

PICKED CLEAN AT LAST

RAINED AWAY OR BURNT DRY.

OUR DESIRING DOES THIS

MAKE NO MISTAKE I’M SPEAKING

OF FACT: THROUGH MERE INDIFFERENCE

WE COULD PREVENT IT.

ONLY OUR FIERCE ATTENTION

GETS HYACINTHS OUT OF THOSE

HARD CEREBRAL LUMPS

UNWRAPS THE WET BUDS DOWN

THE WHOLE LENGTH OF A STEM.

1963

BREAKFAST IN A
BOWLING ALLEY IN
UTICA NEW YORK

SMUDGED EYEBALLS

MOUTH STALE AS AIR

I’M NEWLY DEAD A CORPSE

SO FRESH THE GRAVE UNNERVES ME.

NOBODY HERE BUT ME

AND HERMES BEHIND THE COUNTER

DEFROSTING SANDWICH STEAKS.

PAEANS OF VOX HUMANA

SOB FROM THE WALLS. THIS LAND

IS MY LAND.… IT SOUNDS

MUMMIFIED. HAS NO SEX

NO LIQUOR LICENSE.

I CHEW MEAT AND BREAD

THINKING OF WHEATFIELDS—

A GOLD-BEIGE CEINTURE—

AND CATTLE LIKE GHOSTS

OF THE BUFFALO RUNNING

ACROSS PLAINS NEARING

THE ABBATOIR. HOUSES

DREAM OLD-FASHIONEDLY

IN BACKWOODS TOWNSHIPS

WHILE THE LAND GLITTERS

WITH TEMPORARY LIFE

STUCK FAST BY CHOICE:

TRAILERS PUT OUT TAPROOTS

OF SEWAGE PIPE SUCKERS

OF TV AERIAL—

BUT IN ONE OF THEM

PERHAPS A MAN

ALONE WITH HIS GIRL

FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1963

OPEN-AIR MUSEUM

AILANTHUS GOLDENROD SCRAPIRON WHAT MAKES YOU FLOWER?

WHAT BURNS IN THE DUMP TODAY?

THICK FLAMES IN A GREY FIELD TENDED

BY TWO MEN: ONE DERELICT GHOST

ONE CLEARLY APTER AT NURSING DESTRUCTION

TWO PRIESTS IN A GREY FIELD TENDING THE FLAMES

OF STRIPPED-OFF ROCKWOOL SPLIT

MATTRESSES A CAVED-IN CHICKENHOUSE

MAD LOU’S LAST STACK OF PAINTINGS EACH A PERFECT BLACK LOZENGE

SEEN FROM A TRAIN STOPPED

AS BY DESIGN TO BRING US

FACE TO FACE WITH THE FLAG OF OUR TRUE COUNTRY:

VIOLET-YELLOW BLACK-VIOLET

ITS HEART SUCKED BY SLOW FIRE

O MY AMERICA

THIS THEN WAS YOUR DESIRE?

BUT YOU CANNOT BURN FAST ENOUGH:

IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THE WHITE

SKIRTS OF THE HARLEM BRIDE

ARE LASHED BY BLOWN SCRAPS TABLOID SHEETS

AND HER BEAUTY A SCRAP OF FLICKERING LIGHT

LICKED BY A GREATER DARKNESS

THIS THEN WAS YOUR DESIRE!

THOSE TRUCKED-OFF BAD DREAMS

OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS

CRAWL BACK IN SEARCH OF YOU EYES

MISSING SKINS MISSING INTENSER IN DECAY

THE CARRIAGE THAT WHEELED THE DEFECTIVE BABY

ROLLS UP ON THREE WHEELS

AND THE BABY IS STILL INSIDE

YOU CANNOT BURN FAST ENOUGH

BLUE SPARKS OF THE CHICORY FLOWER

FLASH FROM EMBERS OF THE DUMP

INSIDE THE ROSE-RUST CARCASS OF A SLAUGHTERED CHEVROLET

CROUCHES THE YOUNG AILANTHUS

AND THE TWO GUARDIANS GO RAKING THE SACRED FIELD RAKING

SLOWLY TO WHAT ENDLESS END

CRY OF TRUTH AMONG SO MANY LIES

AT YOUR HEART BURNS ON

A LANGUID FIRE

1964

TWO SONGS

1.

SEX AS THEY HARSHLY CALL IT

I FELL INTO THIS MORNING

AT TEN O’CLOCK A DRIZZLING HOUR

OF TRAFFIC AND WET NEWSPAPERS.

I THOUGHT OF HIM WHO YESTERDAY

CLEARLY DIDN’T

TURN ME TO A HOT FIELD

READY FOR PLOWING

AND LONGING FOR THAT YOUNG MAN

PIERCÉD ME TO THE ROOTS

BATHING EVERY VEIN ETC.

ALL DAY HE APPEARS TO ME

TOUCHINGLY DESIRABLE

A PRIZE ONE COULD WRECK ONE’S PEACE FOR.

I’D CALL IT LOVE IF LOVE

DIDN’T TAKE SO MANY YEARS

BUT LUST TOO IS A JEWEL

A SWEET FLOWER AND WHAT

PURE HAPPINESS TO KNOW

ALL OUR HIGH-TONED QUESTIONS

BREED IN A LIVELY ANIMAL.

2.

THAT “OLD LAST ACT”!

AND YET SOMETIMES

ALL SEEMS POST COITUM TRISTE

AND I A MERE BYSTANDER.

SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING OFF

GETTING SHOT TO THE MOON.

OR A MOON-RACE!

SPLIT SECONDS AFTER MY OPPOSITE NUMBER

LANDS

I MAKE IT—

WE LIE FAINTING TOGETHER

AT A CRATER-EDGE

HEAVY AS MERCURY IN OUR MOONSUITS

TILL HE SPEAKS—

IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE

YET ONE I’VE PICKED UP

THROUGH CULTURAL EXCHANGES …

WE MURMUR THE FIRST MOONWORDS:

SPASIBO. THANKS. O.K.

1964

THE PARTING

THE OCEAN TWANGING AWAY THERE

AND THE ISLANDS LIKE SCATTERED LAUNDRY—

YOU CAN FEEL SO FREE SO FREE

STANDING ON THE HEADLAND

WHERE THE WILD ROSE NEVER STANDS STILL

THE PETALS BLOWN OFF

BEFORE THEY FALL

AND THE CHICORY NODDING

BLUE BLUE IN THE ALL-DAY WIND.

BARBED WIRE DEAD AT YOUR FEET

IS A KIND OF DUNE-VINE

THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT MOVEMENT.

EVERY KNOT IS A KNIFE

WHERE TWO STRANDS TANGLE TO RUST.

1963

NIGHT-PIECES: FOR A CHILD

THE CRIB

YOU SLEEPING I BEND TO COVER.

YOUR EYELIDS WORK. I SEE

YOUR DREAM CLOUDY AS A NEGATIVE

SWIMMING UNDERNEATH.

YOU BLURT A CRY. YOUR EYES

SPRING OPEN STILL FILMED IN DREAM.

WIDER THEY FIX ME—

—DEATH’S HEAD SPHINX MEDUSA?

YOU SCREAM.

TEARS LICK MY CHEEKS MY KNEES

DROOP AT YOUR FEAR.

MOTHER I NO MORE AM

BUT WOMAN AND NIGHTMARE.

HER WAKING

TONIGHT I JERK ASTART IN A DARK

HOURLESS AS HIROSHIMA

ALMOST HEARING YOU BREATHE

IN A COT THREE DOORS AWAY.

YOU STILL BREATHE YES—

AND MY DREAM WITH ITS GIFT OF KNIVES

ITS MURDEROUS HIDER AND SEEKER

EBBS AWAY RECOILS

BACK INTO THE EGG OF DREAMS

THE VANISHING POINT OF MIND.

ALL GONE.

BUT YOU AND I—

SWADDLED IN A DUMB DARK

OLD AS SICKHEARTEDNESS

MODERN AS PURE ANNIHILATION—

WE DRIFT IN IGNORANCE.

IF I COULD HEAR YOU NOW

MUTTER SOME GENTLE ANIMAL SOUND!

IF MILK FLOWED FROM MY BREAST AGAIN….

1964

THE STRANGER

FOND CREDOS PLASTER ECSTASIES!

WE ARRANGE A PRISON-TEMPLE

FOR THE WEAK-LEGGED LITTLE GOD

WHO MIGHT STAMP THE WORLD TO BITS

OR PULL THE SKY IN LIKE A MUSLIN CURTAIN.

WE HANG HIS SHRINE WITH BELLS

AEOLIAN HARPS PAPER WINDMILLS

LINE IT WITH BISCUITS AND SWANSDOWN.

HIS LACK OF CULTURE WE EXPECTED

SCARCELY HIS DISDAIN HOWEVER—

THAT WILD HAUTEUR AS IF

IT WERE WE WHO BLUNDERED.

WILDNESS WE FRET TO AVENGE!

EYE THAT HASN’T YET BLINKED

ON THE UNBLINKING GOLD ARCHWAYS

OF ITS TRANCE—THAT WE KNOW

MUST BE TRAINED AWAY:

THAT ALOOF SELECTIVE STARE.

OTHERNESS THAT AFFRONTS US

AS CATS AND DOGS DO NOT—

ONCE THIS WAS ORIGINAL SIN

BEATEN AWAY WITH STAVES OF HOLY WRIT.

OLD SIMPLEMINDEDNESS. BUT THE PRIMAL FAULT

OF THE LITTLE GOD STILL BAFFLES.

ALL OTHER STRANGERS ARE FORGIVEN

THEIR STRANGENESS BUT HE—

HOW SAVE THE EGGSHELL WORLD FROM HIS

REACHING HANDS HOW SHIELD

OURSELVES FROM THE DISINTEGRATING

BLAZE OF HIS WIDE PURE EYE?

1964

AFTER DARK

I.

YOU ARE FALLING ASLEEP AND I SIT LOOKING AT YOU

OLD TREE OF LIFE

OLD MAN WHOSE DEATH I WANTED

I CAN’T STIR YOU UP NOW.

FAINTLY A PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE

WHIRS ROUND IN THE LAST GROOVE

EATING MY HEART TO DUST.

THAT TERRIBLE RECORD! HOW IT PLAYED

DOWN YEARS WHEREVER I WAS

IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES EVEN

OVER AND OVER I KNOW YOU BETTER

THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELFI KNOW

YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW

YOURSELFI KNOW

YOUUNTIL SELF-MAIMED

I LIMPED OFF TORN AT THE ROOTS

STOPPED SINGING A WHOLE YEAR

GOT A NEW BODY NEW BREATH

GOT CHILDREN CROAKED FOR WORDS

FORGOT TO LISTEN

OR READ YOUR MENE TEKEL FADING ON THE WALL

WOKE UP ONE MORNING

AND KNEW MYSELF YOUR DAUGHTER.

BLOOD IS A SACRED POISON.

NOW UNASKED YOU GIVE GROUND.

WE ONLY WANT TO STIFLE

WHAT’S STIFLING US ALREADY.

ALIVE NOW ROOT TO CROWN I’D GIVE

—OH—SOMETHING—NOT TO KNOW

OUR STRUGGLES NOW ARE ENDED.

I SEEM TO HOLD YOU CUPPED

IN MY HANDS AND DISAPPEARING.

WHEN YOUR MEMORY FAILS—

NO MORE TO SCOURGE MY INCONSISTENCIES—

THE SASHCORDS OF THE WORLD FLY LOOSE.

A WINDOW CRASHES

SUDDENLY DOWN. I GO TO THE WOODBOX

AND TAKE A STICK OF KINDLING

TO PROP THE SASH AGAIN.

I GROW PROTECTIVE TOWARD THE WORLD.

II.

NOW LET’S AWAY FROM PRISON—

UNDERGROUND SEIZURES!

I USED TO HUDDLE IN THE GRAVE

I’D DUG FOR YOU AND BITE

MY TONGUE FOR FEAR IT WOULD BABBLE

—DARLING—

I THOUGHT THEY’D FIND ME THERE

SOMEDAY SITTING UPRIGHT SHRUNKEN

MY HAIR LIKE ROOTS AND IN MY LAP

A MESS OF BROKEN POTTERY—

WASTED LIBATION—

AND YOU EMBALMED BESIDE ME.

NO LET’S AWAY. EVEN NOW

THERE’S A WALK BETWEEN DOOMED ELMS

(WHOSE LIKE WE SHALL NOT SEE MUCH LONGER)

AND SOMETHING—GRASS AND WATER—

AN OLD DREAM-PHOTOGRAPH.

I’LL SIT WITH YOU THERE AND TEASE YOU

FOR WISDOM IF YOU LIKE

WAITING TILL THE BLUNT BARGE

BUMPS ALONG THE SHORE.

POPPIES BURN IN THE TWILIGHT

LIKE SMUDGE POTS.

I THINK YOU HARDLY SEE ME

BUT—THIS IS THE DREAM NOW—

YOUR FEARS BLOW OUT

OFF OVER THE WATER.

AT THE LAST YOUR HAND FEELS STEADY.

1964

MOURNING PICTURE

THE PICTURE IS BY EDWIN ROMANZO ELMER 1850–1923.

THEY HAVE CARRIED THE MAHOGANY CHAIR AND THE CANE ROCKER

OUT UNDER THE LILAC BUSH

AND MY FATHER AND MOTHER DARKLY SIT THERE IN BLACK CLOTHES.

OUR CLAPBOARD HOUSE STANDS FAST ON ITS HILL

MY DOLL LIES IN HER WICKER PRAM

GAZING AT WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS.

THIS WAS OUR WORLD.

I COULD REMAKE EACH SHAFT OF GRASS

FEELING ITS RASP ON MY FINGERS

DRAW OUT THE MAP OF EVERY LILAC LEAF

OR THE NET OF VEINS ON MY FATHER’S

GRIEF-TRANCED HAND.

OUT OF MY HEAD HALF-BURSTING

STILL FILLING THE DREAM CONDENSES—

SHADOWS CRYSTALS CEILINGS MEADOWS GLOBES OF DEW.

UNDER THE DULL GREEN OF THE LILACS OUT IN THE LIGHT

CARVING EACH SPOKE OF THE PRAM THE TURNED PORCH-PILLARS

UNDER HIGH EARLY-SUMMER CLOUDS

I AM EFFIE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE

REMEMBERING AND REMEMBERED.

THEY WILL MOVE FROM THE HOUSE

GIVE THE TOYS AND THE PETS AWAY.

MUTE AND RIGID WITH LOSS MY MOTHER

WILL RIDE THE TRAIN TO BAPTIST CORNER

THE SILK-SPOOL WILL RUN BARE.

I TELL YOU THE THREAD THAT BOUND US LIES

FAINT AS A WEB IN THE DEW.

SHOULD I MAKE YOU WORLD AGAIN

COULD I GIVE BACK THE LEAF ITS SKELETON THE AIR

ITS EARLY-SUMMER CLOUD THE HOUSE

ITS NOONDAY PRESENCE SHADOWLESS

AND LEAVE THIS OUT? I AM EFFIE YOU WERE MY DREAM.

1965

“I AM IN DANGER—SIR—”

“HALF-CRACKED” TO HIGGINSON LIVING

AFTERWARD FAMOUS IN GARBLED VERSIONS

YOUR HOARD OF DAZZLING SCRAPS A BATTLEFIELD

NOW YOUR OLD SNOOD

MOTHBALLED AT HARVARD

AND YOU IN YOUR VARIORUM MONUMENT

EQUIVOCAL TO THE END—

WHO ARE YOU?

GARDENING THE DAY-LILY

WIPING THE WINE-GLASS STEMS

YOUR THOUGHT PULSED ON BEHIND

A FOREHEAD BATTERED PAPER-THIN

YOU WOMAN MASCULINE

IN SINGLE-MINDEDNESS

FOR WHOM THE WORD WAS MORE

THAN A SYMPTOM—

A CONDITION OF BEING.

TILL THE AIR BUZZING WITH SPOILED LANGUAGE

SANG IN YOUR EARS

OF PERJURY

AND IN YOUR HALF-CRACKED WAY YOU CHOSE

SILENCE FOR ENTERTAINMENT

CHOSE TO HAVE IT OUT AT LAST

ON YOUR OWN PREMISES.

1964

HALFWAY

IN MEMORY: M.G.J.

IN THE FIELD THE AIR WRITHES A HEAT-POCKET.

MASSES OF BIRDS REVOLVE BLADES

OF A HARVESTER.

THE SKY IS GETTING MILKILY WHITE

A SAC OF LIGHT IS READY TO BURST OPEN.

TIME OF HAILSTONES AND RAINBOW.

MY LIFE FLOWS NORTH. AT LAST I UNDERSTAND.

A YOUNG GIRL THOUGHT SLEEPING IS CERTIFIED DEAD.

A TRAY OF EXPENSIVE WAXEN FRUIT

SHE LIES ARRANGED ON THE SPARE-ROOM COVERLID.

TO SIT BY THE FIRE IS TO BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN

RED HAIR CHARRING TO GREY

GREEN EYES GRAPPLING WITH THE PRINTED PAGE

VOICE FLAILING FLAILING THE UNCOMPREHENDING.

MY DAYS LIE OPEN LISTENING GRANDMOTHER.

1965

AUTUMN SEQUENCE

1.

AN OLD SHOE AN OLD POT AN OLD SKIN

AND DREAMS OF THE SUBTLY TYRANNICAL.

THIRST IN THE MORNING; WAKING INTO THE BLUE

DROUGHT OF ANOTHER OCTOBER

TO READ THE FAMILIAR MESSAGE NAILED

TO SOME BURNING BUSH OR MAPLE.

BREAKFAST UNDER THE PINES LATE YELLOW-

JACKETS FUMBLING FOR MANNA ON THE RIM

OF THE STONE CROCK OF MARMALADE

AND SHED PINE-NEEDLES DRIFTING

IN THE HALF-EMPTY CUP.

GENEROSITY IS DRYING OUT

IT’S AN ACT OF WILL TO REMEMBER

MAY’S STICKY-MOUTHED BUDS

ON THE PROVOKED MAGNOLIAS.

2.

STILL A SWEETNESS HARDLY EARNED

BY VIRTUE OR CRAFT BELONGING

BY NO DESPERATE RIGHT TO ME

(AS THE MARMALADE TO THE WASP

WHO RISKED ALL IN A LAST EUPHORIA

OF HUNGER)

WASHES THE HORIZON. A QUIET

AFTER WEEPING SALT STILL ON THE TONGUE

IS LIKE THIS WHEN THE AUTUMN PLANET

LOOKS ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

AND STRAIGHT INTO THE MIND

PLUNGES ITS IMPERSONAL SPEAR:

FILL AND FLOW OVER THINK

TILL YOU WEEP THEN SLEEP

TO DRINK AGAIN.

3.

YOUR FLAG IS DRIED-BLOOD TURKEY-COMB

FLAYED STIFF IN THE WIND

HALF-MAST ON THE DAY OF VICTORY

ANARCHIST PRINCE OF EVENING MARSHES!

YOUR EYE BLURS IN A WET SMOKE

THE STUBBLE FREEZES UNDER YOUR HEEL

THE CORNSILK MÄDCHEN ALL HAGS NOW

THEIR GOLD TEETH DRAWN

THE MILKWEEDS GUTTED AND RIFLED

BUT NOT BY YOU FOUNDERING HERO!

THE FUTURE RECONNOITERS IN DIRTY BOOTS

ALONG THE CRANBERRY-DARK HORIZON.

STARS SWIM LIKE GREASE-FLECKS

IN THAT SKY NIGHT PULLS A LONG KNIFE.

YOUR EMPIRE DROPS TO ITS KNEES IN THE DARK.

4.

SKIN OF WET LEAVES ON ASPHALT.

CHARCOAL SLABS PITTED WITH GOLD.

THE REASON FOR CITIES COMES CLEAR.

THERE MUST BE A PLACE THERE HAS COME A TIME—

WHERE SO MANY NERVES ARE FUSING—

FOR A PURELY MORAL LONELINESS.

BEHIND BLOODSOAKED LIGHTS OF THE AVENUES

IN THE CRYSTAL GRIT OF FLYING SNOW

IN THIS WATER-DROP BULGING AT THE TAPHEAD

FORCED BY DYNAMOS THREE HUNDRED MILES

FROM THE WILD DUCK’S LANDING AND THE OTTER’S DIVE

FOR THREE SECONDS OF QUIVERING IDENTITY.

THERE MUST BE A PLACE. BUT THE EYEBALL STIFFENS

AS NIGHT TIGHTENS AND MY HERO PASSES OUT

WITH A FILM OF STALE GOSSIP COATING HIS TONGUE.

1964

NOON

LIGHT PULSES THROUGH UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS.

I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF: MY EYES ARE NOT BLUE.

TWO DARK HOLES

FEED AT THE SKY.

IT SWIRLS THROUGH THEM RAGING

IN AZURE SPIRALS.

NOTHING CHANGES THEM:

TWO BLACK TUBES DRAINING OFF

A LAKE OF IRIS.

CLEAVE OPEN MY SKULL:

THE GOUTS OF BLUE

LEAP FROM THE BLACK GROTTO.

1965

NOT LIKE THAT

IT’S SO PURE IN THE CEMETERY.

THE CHILDREN LOVE TO PLAY UP HERE.

IT’S A LITTLE TOWN A GAME OF BLOCKS

A VILLAGE PACKED IN A BOX

A PRE-WAR GERMAN TOY.

THE TURF IS A BEDROOM CARPET:

HEAL-ALL STRAWBERRY FLOWER

AND HILLOCKS OF MOSS.

TO COME AND SIT HERE FOREVER

A CUP OF TEA ON ONE’S LAP

AND ONE’S EYES CLOSED LIGHTLY LIGHTLY

PERFECTLY STILL

IN A NINETEENTH-CENTURY SLEEP!

IT SEEMS SO NORMAL TO DIE.

NOBODY SLEEPS HERE CHILDREN.

THE LITTLE BEDS OF WHITE WROUGHT IRON

AND THE TALL KIND FACELESS NURSE

ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN A HOSPITAL

OR THE DREAMS OF PRISONERS OF WAR.

THE DRAWERS OF THIS TRUNK ARE EMPTY

NOT EVEN A SNAPSHOT

CURLS IN A CORNER.

IN PULLMANS OF CHILDHOOD WE LAY

ENTHRALLED BEHIND DARK-GREEN CURTAINS

AND A LITTLE LAMP BURNED BLUE

ALL NIGHT FOR US. THE DAY

WAS A DREAM TOO EVEN THE OATMEAL

UNDER ITS SILVER LID DREAM-CEREAL

SPOONED OUT IN FORESTS OF SPRUCE

SKIRTING THE GREEN-BLACK GORGES

THICK WOODS OF SLEEP HALF PRICKLE

HALF LAKES OF FERN.

TO STAY HERE FOREVER

IS NOT LIKE THAT NOR EVEN

SIMPLY TO LIE QUITE STILL

THE WARM TRICKLE OF DREAM

STAINING THE THICK QUIET.

THE DRAWERS OF THIS TRUNK ARE EMPTY.

THEY ARE ALL OUT OF SLEEP UP HERE.

1965

THE KNOT

IN THE HEART OF THE QUEEN ANNE’S LACE A KNOT OF BLOOD.

FOR YEARS I NEVER SAW IT

YEARS OF METALLIC VISION

SPEARS GLANCING OFF A BRIGHT EYEBALL

SUNS OFF A SWISS LAKE.

A FOAMING MEADOW; THE MILKY WAY;

AND THERE ALL ALONG THE TINY DARK-RED SPIDER

SITTING IN THE WHITENESS OF THE BRIDAL WEB

WAITING TO PLUNGE HIS CRIMSON KNIFEPOINT

INTO THE WHITE APPARENCIES.

LITTLE WONDER THE EYE HEALING SEES

FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH A MIST OF BLOOD.

1965

ANY HUSBAND TO ANY WIFE

“MIGHT I DIE LAST AND SHOW THEE!”

I KNOW: YOU ARE GLYCERINE

OLD QUILLS ROSE VELVET

TEARSTAINS IN MIDDLEMARCH

A STYLE OF GETTING INTO CABS OF EATING FRUIT

A DRAWER OF STONES CHAINS SEEDS SHELLS LITTLE MIRRORS:

DARLING YOU WILL OUTLIVE YOURSELF AND ME.

SOMETIMES THE SEA BACKS UP AGAINST A LASHED PIER

GRINDING AND TWISTING

A TURMOIL OF WRECKED STUFF

ALIVE AND DEAD. AND THE PIER STANDS GROANING

AS IF THE LAND DEPENDED ON IT.

WE SAY IT IS THE MOON THAT DRAWS THESE TIDES

THEN GLAZES IN AFTERCALM

THE BLACK BLURRED FACE TO SOMETHING WE CAN LOVE.

1965

SIDE BY SIDE

HO! IN THE DAWN

HOW LIGHT WE LIE

STIRRING FAINTLY AS LAUNDRY

LEFT ALL NIGHT ON THE LINES.

YOU A LEMON-GOLD PYJAMA

I A TROUSSEAU-SHEET FINE

LINEN WORN PAPER-THIN IN PLACES

WORKED WITH THE MAIDEN MONOGRAM.

LASSITUDE DRAPES OUR FOLDS.

WE’RE SLOWLY BLEACHING

WITH THE DAYS THE HOURS AND THE YEARS.

WE ARE GETTING FINER THAN EVER

TIME IS WEARING US TO SILK

TO SHEER SPIDERWEB.

THE EYE OF THE SUN RISING LOOKS IN

TO ASCERTAIN HOW WE ARE COMING ON.

1965

SPRING THUNDER

1.

THUNDER IS ALL IT IS AND YET

MY STREET BECOMES A CRACK IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE

MY HOUSE A FRAGILE NEST OF GRASSES.

THE RADIOTELESCOPE FLINGS ITS NETS

AT RANDOM; A CHILD IS CRYING

NOT FROM HUNGER NOT FROM PAIN

MORE LIKELY IMPOTENCE. THE GENERALS ARE SWELTERING

IN THE ROOM WITH A THOUSAND EYES.

RED-HOT LIGHTS FLASH OFF AND ON

INSIDE AIR-CONDITIONED SKULLS.

UNDERFOOT A LAND-MASS

PUFFED-UP WITH BAD FAITH AND FATIGUE

GOES LUMBERING ONWARD

OLD RAFT IN THE SWOLLEN WATERS

UNREFORMED HUCK AND JIM

WATCHING THE TANGLED YELLOW SHORES

RUSH BY.

2.

WHATEVER YOU ARE THAT WEEPS

OVER THE BLISTERED RIVERBEDS

AND THE CRACKED SKIN OF CITIES

YOU ARE NOT ON OUR SIDE

EYE NEVER SEEKING OUR EYES

SHEDDING ITS GRIEFS LIKE STARS

OVER OUR HECTIC INDIFFERENCE

WHISPERED MONOLOGUE

SUBVERTING SPACE WITH ITS TEARS

MOURNING THE MOURNABLE

NAILING THE PALE-GREY WOOLLY FLOWER

BACK TO ITS LEDGE.

3.

THE POWER OF THE DINOSAUR

IS OURS TO DIE

INFLICTING DEATH

TRAMPLING THE NESTED GRASSES:

POWER OF DEAD GRASS

TO CATCH FIRE

POWER OF ASH

TO WHIRL OFF THE BURNT HEAP

IN THE WIND’S OWN TIME.

4.

A SOLDIER IS HERE AN ANCIENT FIGURE

GENERALIZED AS A BASALT MASK.

BREATHES LIKE A RABBIT AN ESKIMO

STRIPS TO AN OLDER AND SIMPLER THING.

NO CRIMINAL NO HERO; MERELY A SHADOW

CAST BY THE CONFLAGRATION

THAT HERE BURNS DOWN OR THERE LEAPS HIGHER

BUT ALWAYS IN THE SHAPE OF FIRE

ALWAYS THE METHOD OF FIRE CASTING

AUTOMATICALLY THESE SHADOWS.

5.

OVER HIM OVER YOU A GREAT ROOF IS RISING

A GREAT WALL: NO TEMPORARY SHELTER.

DID YOU TELL YOURSELF THESE BEAMS WOULD MELT

THESE FIERY BLOCS DISSOLVE?

DID YOU CHOOSE TO BUILD THIS THING?

HAVE YOU STEPPED BACK TO SEE WHAT IT IS?

IT IS IMMENSE; IT HAS PORCHES CATACOMBS.

IT IS PROVISIONED LIKE THE PYRAMIDS FOR ETERNITY.

ITS BUTTRESSES BEAT BACK THE AIR WITH IRON TENDONS.

IT IS THE FIRST FLYING CATHEDRAL

EATING ITS PARISHES BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON.

IT IS THE REFINERY OF PURE ABSTRACTION

A TOTAL LOGIC RISING

OBSCURELY BETWEEN ONE MAN

AND THE OLD AFFECTIVE CLOUDS.

1965

MOTH HOUR

SPACE MILDEWS AT OUR TOUCH.

THE LEAVES OF THE POPLAR SLOWLY MOVING—

AREN’T THEY MOTH-WHITE THERE IN THE MOONBEAMS?

A MILLION INSECTS DIE EVERY TWILIGHT

NO ONE EVEN FINDS THEIR CORPSES.

DEATH SLOWLY MOVING AMONG THE BLEACHED CLOUDS

KNOWS US BETTER THAN WE KNOW OURSELVES.

I AM GLIDING BACKWARD AWAY FROM THOSE WHO KNEW ME

AS THE MOON GROWS THINNER AND FINALLY SHUTS ITS LANTERN.

I CAN BE REPLACED A THOUSAND TIMES

A BOX CONTAINING DEATH.

WHEN YOU PUT OUT YOUR HAND TO TOUCH ME

YOU ARE ALREADY REACHING TOWARD AN EMPTY SPACE.

1965

FOCUS

FOR BERT DREYFUS

OBSCURITY HAS ITS TALE TO TELL.

LIKE THE FIGURE ON THE STUDIO-BED IN THE CORNER

OUT OF RANGE SMOKING WATCHING AND WAITING.

SUN POURS THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT ONTO THE WORKTABLE

MAKING OF A JAR OF PENCILS A TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD

MORE THAN THEY WERE. VERIDICAL LIGHT …

EARTH BUDGES. NOW AN EMPTY COFFEE-CUP

A WHETSTONE A HANDKERCHIEF TAKE ON

THEIR SACRAMENTAL CLARITY FIXED BY THE WAND

OF LIGHT AS THE THINKER THINKS TO FIX THEM IN THE MIND.

O SECRET IN THE CORE OF THE WHETSTONE IN THE FIVE

PENCILS SPLAYED OUT LIKE FINGERS OF A HAND!

THE MIND’S PASSION IS ALL FOR SINGLING OUT.

OBSCURITY HAS ANOTHER TALE TO TELL.

1965

FACE TO FACE

NEVER TO BE LONELY LIKE THAT—

THE EARLY AMERICAN FIGURE ON THE BEACH

IN BLACK COAT AND KNEE-BREECHES

SCANNING THE DIDACTIC STORM IN PRIVACY

NEVER TO HEAR THE PRAIRIE WOLVES

IN THEIR LUNAR HILARITY

CIRCLING ONE’S LITTLE ALL ONE’S CLAIM

TO BE LAW AND PROPHETS

FOR ALL THAT LAWLESSNESS

NEVER TO WHET THE APPETITE

WEEKS EARLY FOR A FACE A HAND

LONGED-FOR AND DREADED—

HOW PEOPLE USED TO MEET!

STARVED INTENSE THE OLD

CHRISTMAS GIFTS SAVED UP TILL SPRING

AND THE OLD PLAIN WORDS

AND EACH WITH HIS GOD-GIVEN SECRET

SPELLED OUT THROUGH MONTHS OF SNOW AND SILENCE

BURNING UNDER THE BLEACHED SCALP; BEHIND DRY LIPS

A LOADED GUN.

EMBITTERED NEARER FLOWERS

A SMELL OF FURTHER HONEY

SIRENED US FROM OUR MEADOW.

THAT SMELL AND A SOFT HUMMING

CRYSTALLIZED IN THE AZURE

THAT SMELL AND A SOFT HUMMING

A WORDLESS REPETITION

CALLED UPON US THE RECKLESS

CALLED UPON US THE RECKLESS

TO SEEK MYSTERIOUS ROSES.

FAR FROM OUR FOLK AND KINDRED

JOYOUS WE WENT CAREERING

FAR FROM OUR FOLK AND KINDRED

EXHUBERANTLY DRIVEN.

NO ONE CAN BY NATURE

NO ONE CAN BY NATURE

ENDURE DEATH IN HIS BODY.

ALWAYS MORE FIERCELY YIELDING

MORE LUCENTLY TRANSFIGURED

ALWAYS MORE FIERCELY YIELDING

WE ROSE AND STAGGERED UPWARD

KIDNAPPED DISEMBODIED

WE ROSE AND VANISHED UPWARD

DISSOLVING INTO GLITTER.

IT’S SNOWING; WE ARE DYING

HOMEWARD DOWNWARD WHIRLED.

IT’S SNOWING; WE ARE DYING;

IT SNOWS AMONG THE HIVES.

MY BROTHER

MY BROTHER NOBODY KNOWS

THE END YOU SUFFERED.

OFTEN YOU LIE BESIDE ME DIM AND I

GROW CONFUSED GROPE AND STARTLE.

YOU WALKED ALONG THAT PATH THROUGH THE ELMS.

BIRDS CRIED LATE. SOMETHING WRONG

WAS FOLLOWING US BOTH. BUT YOU

WANTED TO GO ALONE THROUGH THE WASTE.

LAST NIGHT WE SLEPT AGAIN TOGETHER.

YOUR HEART JERKED NEXT TO ME. I SPOKE YOUR NAME

AND ASKED WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

YOUR ANSWER CAME:

“THE HORROR! … THERE’S NO TELLING …

SEE: THE GRASS

LIES DENSE AGAIN THE ELMS

PRESS ROUND.”

HENDRIK DE VRIES

LISTEN! IT’S NEVER SUNG LIKE THAT! LISTEN!

THE WALLPAPER STIRRED

AND THE HAIRS OF THE HEAVY-FRINGED EYE.

WHAT FLEW

THROUGH THE ROOMS?

TOMORROW IT WILL BE

AS IF ALL NIGHT THE WHIPS HADN’T LASHED SO.—

SEE THROUGH THE BLINDS

THE SPIRITS IN THEIR COLD SHIPS!

BOUGHS GRAZE THE FRAME

OF THE WINDOW. FAR OFF A WHISTLE

SOUNDS ALWAYS CLEARLY ALONG THE FIELDS.

THE BEASTS ON THE WALLS

FADE AWAY. THE LIGHT GOES OUT.

AT THAT HOUR NOT ANOTHER SOUL ABROAD;

THE BLUE FARMHOUSE A CLOSED HERMITAGE.

THERE WE LIVED TOGETHER MAN AND MOUSE.

THROUGH COWSTALL WINDOWS AN ETERNAL FIRE

FELL RIDGED FROM GOLD LAMPS ON THE THRESHING-FLOOR

STILLNESS OF LINSEED CAKES AND HAY IN HOUSE.

THERE MY FATHER CELEBRATED MASS:

SERVING THE COWS PRIESTLIKE AT THEIR HEADS.

THEIR TONGUES CURLED ALONG HIS HANDS LIKE FISH.

A SHADOW DIAGONAL TO THE RAFTERS.

WORSHIP HUNG HEAVY FROM THE LOFTBEAMS.

I’M AN ETERNITY TOO LATE.

AND WHERE’S YOUR HEARTBEAT?

THE THICK NIGHT GLUES US TOGETHER

MAKES US COMPACT WITH EACH OTHER.

“FOR GOD’S SAKE GO ON HOLDING ME—

LEO VROMAN

OUR FAMILY

MY FATHER WHO SINCE HIS DEATH

NO LONGER SPEAKS AUDIBLY

LIES SOMETIMES A GREAT WALRUS

FROM NIGHTFALL TO DAYBREAK

HIS MUZZLE IN MY LAP

IN THE STREET FROM HIS CHIN DOWN.

THE LIGHT OF MORNING FEEDS

THROUGH HIS HIDE THINNED TO PARCHMENT

AND HIS SLACKENED FEATURES DWINDLE

TO A LINE CREEPING OFF AMONG THE CHAIRS;

IF I RISE TO PEER AT HIM

HE WINCES AWAY TO A DOT

IN THE DAYTIME THERE’S NOTHING TO SEE

BUT AN EMPHATICALLY VANISHED

ABSENCE WHERE MOMENTS AGO

THE SUN TOO WAS JUST SHINING.

WHERE MY FATHER HAS STOOD

IT NOW JUST QUIVERS

RIPPLING BY HANDFULS THROUGH

MY LITTLE DAUGHTER’S LIGHT HAIR

WHILE ON THE SUNNY GRASS

SHE SLOWLY SCAMPERS FORWARD.

HER LITTLE SNOOT IS SO OPEN

YOU COULD EASILY SPREAD IT OUT

WITH A TEASPOON OR YOUR FINGER

ON A SLICE OF FRESH WHITE BREAD

OR IF NEED BE

YOU COULD MOLD IT INTO A PUDDING.

HER LITTLE VOICE ITCHES LIKE A FLEECE;

IT WRIGGLES GAILY INTO MY EAR

AND CAN’T GET OUT WHEN IT LAUGHS;

WITH PLOPPING FISHFINS

IT FOLDS ITSELF STRUGGLING UP

INTO MY HEAD. WHERE IT SPENDS THE NIGHT.

AND HERE THIS TALLER CHILD

IS TINEKE MY WIFE.

SHE HUMS A NURSERY RHYME

TO THE HAIR ON HER THIRD BREAST

WHICH WHIMPERS BEING A BABY

AND A THIRSTY BABY AT THAT.

I HAVE SUCH A GENTLE FAMILY

IT KISSES GOES ON EIGHT LEGS

BUT IT HAS NO MOUSTACHE:

MY FATHER HAS VANISHED

AND THEY TOO ARE ALL GOING TO DIE:

TOO SOFT IF THEY TURN INTO AIR

TO SWING A WEATHERCOCK;

IF TURNED INTO WATER TOO SLIGHT

TO FILL A GUTTER; IF INTO LIGHT

TO MAKE ONE LIVE COCK CROW.

HOMECOMING

THE SEA A BODY OF MYSTERIOUS CALLS

IS ALMOST MOTIONLESS.

I KNOW A BEACH A TREE STANDS THERE

IN WHICH WOMEN ARE SINGING

VOLUPTUOUS LANGUID.

IN HARBORS SHIPS ARE STEAMING

FULL OF HONEY FROM THE SEA. DRIZZLE HANGS

LIKE EYELASHES OVER THE LANDSCAPE.

BEHIND THE SEADIKE BREATHING INVISIBLY

IN THE MIST SLEEP THE COWS.

THE HOBBLE OF A HORSE DRAGS ALONG THE FENCE

HOLDING STILL WHERE I STAND WITH SWEET WORDS.

LISTEN THE SEA CALLS

CLAPS HER HANDS.

THE SHIPS RUNNING OUT IN THE WET

COME LIKE CHILDREN—ONE DRAGS

A SLED INTO THE GARDEN.

WHISTLE NOW OUT OF THE NIGHTS

WHISPER FIRE IN THE DAYS

DRIED BY THE SUN YOUR DESIRES

ARE LIGHTENED CURLED TO ASH.

FLOWERS FOR HUNGER

THE DARKEST THE BLUE

OF ASH OF GREY GRANITE

BLACK ICE

ROOM WITHOUT WINDOW

ABACUS WITHOUT BEADS

ROOM WITHOUT A PERSON

THE EATEN PAST

GNAWS

THE TEETH OUT OF THE COMB

THE FUNERAL WREATH EMPTILY DEVOURED

A STONE.

WHATEVER I MAY CONTRIVE—

AND I CONTRIVE IT—DEATH’S

PRIVATE ROADS ARE THE COLDEST NIGHT.

THAT I SHALL NOT BE WITH HER—

NOT WITH HER—

THAT NOTHING SHALL GLIMMER

EXCEPT DANGER.

TREES OF ASH TREES OF ICE

THE LIGHT FROZEN.

SUMMER AND WINTER ARE

CONSTRUCTED OF ONE EMPTINESS.

THE BOUGHS OF THE WIND ARE DEAD.

MUST I DEJECTED AND CONTEMPLATING DEATH

NOW THAT ABOVE THE SEA A CLOUDLESS NIGHT

EMPTIES THE SKY LET TREASON AND FALSE LAUGHTER

PRUDENTLY RING OUT UNTIL THE MORNING?

THE THRESHOLD OF THE HORIZON SHIFTS—

AND THINK WITH THE THINKERS OF THIS EARTH:

“LIFE IS THUS”—THEN AM I CRAZED

BECAUSE MY HEART ENCLOSES WHAT IT HELD?

MORNING HAS BROKEN AND THE SEA

IS WIDE I GO BACK HOME TO SLEEP.

PATH DUNE TREES AND SHEEP

ARE ROSY FROM THE EAST A ROSY GULL

FLIES UP UNDER THE RASH SKY.

WHAT’S SILENT SPEAKS ALOUD BURIED IN SLEEP.

TO JUDITH TAKING LEAVE

FOR J.H.

DULL-HEADED WITH DULL FINGERS

I PATCH ONCE MORE

THE PALE BROWN ENVELOPE

STILL SHOWING UNDER INK SCRATCHES

THE LETTERHEAD OF MIND.

A CHORUS OF OLD POSTMARKS

ECHOES ACROSS ITS FACE.

IT LOOKS SO FRAIL

TO SEND SO FAR

AND I SHOULD TEAR IT ACROSS

MINDLESSLY

AND FIND ANOTHER.

BUT I’M TIRED CAN’T ENDURE

A SINGLE NEW MOTION

OR ROOM OR OBJECT

SO I CLING TO THIS TOO

AS IF YOUR TALLNESS MOVING

AGAINST THE RAINLIGHT

IN AN AMSTERDAM FLAT

MIGHT BE HELD AWHILE

BY A HANDWRITTEN LABEL

OR A BATTERED ENVELOPE

FROM YOUR DESK.

ONCE SOMEWHERE ELSE

I SHAN’T TALK OF YOU

AS A SINGULAR EVENT

OR A BEAUTIFUL THING I SAW

THOUGH BOTH ARE TRUE.

I SHAN’T FALSIFY YOU

THROUGH PRAISING AND DESCRIBING

AS I SHALL OTHER

THINGS I HAVE LOVED

ALMOST AS MUCH.

THERE IN AMSTERDAM

YOU’LL BE LIVING AS I

HAVE SEEN YOU LIVE

AND AS I’VE NEVER SEEN YOU.

AND I CAN TRUST

NO PLANE TO BRING YOU

MY LIFE OUT THERE

IN TURBID AMERICA—

MY OWN LIFE LIVED AGAINST

FACTS I KEEP THERE.

IT WASN’T LITERACY—

THE RIGHT TO READ MIND—

OR SUFFRAGE—TO VOTE

FOR THE LESSER OF TWO

EVILS—THAT WERE

THE GREAT GAINS I SEE NOW

WHEN I THINK OF ALL THOSE WOMEN

WHO SUFFERED RIDICULE

FOR US.

BUT THIS LITTLE PIECE OF GROUND

JUDITH! THAT TWO WOMEN

IN LOVE TO THE NERVES’ LIMIT

WITH TWO MEN—

SHARED OUT IN PIECES

TO MEN CHILDREN MEMORIES

SO DIFFERENT AND SO DRAINING—

SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE

NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME

PERHAPS TO LOVE EACH OTHER

NEITHER AS FELLOW-VICTIMS

NOR AS A TEMPORARY

SHADOW OF SOMETHING BETTER.

STILL SHARED-OUT AS WE ARE

LOVERS POETS WARMERS

OF MEN AND CHILDREN

AGAINST OUR FLESH NOT KNOWING

FROM DAY TO DAY

WHAT WE’LL FLING OUT ON THE WATER

OR WHAT PICK UP

THERE AT THE TIDE’S LIP

OFTEN TIRED AS I’M TIRED NOW

FROM SHEER DISTANCES OF SOUL

WE HAVE IN ONE DAY TO COVER—

STILL TO GET HERE

TO THIS LITTLE SPUR OR HEADLAND

AND FEEL NOW FREE ENOUGH

TO LEAVE OUR WEAPONS SOMEWHERE

ELSE—SUCH ARE THE SECRET

OUTCOMES OF REVOLUTION!

THAT TWO WOMEN CAN MEET

NO LONGER AS CRAMPED SHARERS

OF A BITTER MUTUAL SECRET

BUT AS TWO EYES IN ONE BROW

RECEIVING AT ONE MOMENT

THE RAINBOW OF THE WORLD.

ROOTS

FOR M.L.

EVENINGS SEEM ENDLESS NOW

DARK TUGS AT OUR SKY

HARDER AND EARLIER

NOW IN MY TRANSATLANTIC EYE

YOU STAND ON YOUR TERRACE

A SCARF ON YOUR HEAD AND IN YOUR HANDS

DEAD STALKS OF GOLDEN-GLOW

AND NOW IT’S FOR YOU

NOT MYSELF I SHIVER

HEARING GLASS DOORS RATTLE

AT YOUR BACK THE RUSTLING COUGH

OF A DRY CLEMATIS VINE

YOUR LOVE AND TOIL TRAINED UP THE WALLS

OF A RENTED HOUSE.

ALL THOSE ROOTS MARGO!

DIDN’T YOU START EACH SLIP BETWEEN YOUR BREASTS

EACH DRY SEED CARRYING SOME

ACROSS FRONTIERS KNOTTED

INTO YOUR HANDKERCHIEF

HAVEN’T YOU SEEN YOUR TEARS

GLISTEN IN NARROW TRENCHES

WHERE ROOTED CUTTINGS GROPE FOR LIFE?

YOU FRAILER THAN YOU LOOK

LONG BACK LONG STRIDE BLOND HAIR

COILED UP OVER STRAIGHT SHOULDERS—

I HEAR IN YOUR EAR THE WIND

LASHING IN WET FROM THE NORTH SEA

SLAMMING THE DAHLIAS FLAT.

ALL YOUR WORK VIOLATED

EVERY AUTUMN EVERY TURN OF THE WRIST

GUIDING THE TROWEL: MOCKED.

SLEET ON BROWN FIBERS

BLACK WILT EATING YOUR HARVEST

A CLEAN SWEEP AND YOU THE LOSER …

OR IS THIS AFTER ALL

THE LIBERATION YOUR HANDS FEND OFF

AND YOUR EYES IMPLORE

WHEN YOU DREAM OF SUDDEN DEATH

OR OF BEGINNING ANEW

A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN THE WAR JUST OVER

AND ALL THE GARDENS

TO DIG AGAIN?

1963

THE PARTING: II

WHITE MORNING FLOWS INTO THE MIRROR.

HER EYE STILL OLD WITH SLEEP

MEETS ITSELF LIKE A SISTER.

HOW THEY SLEPT LAST NIGHT

THE DREAM THAT CAGED THEM BACK TO BACK

WAS NOTHING NEW.

LAST WORDS TEARS MOST OFTEN

COME WRAPPED AS THE EVERYDAY

FAMILIAR FAILURE.

NOW PULLING THE COMB SLOWLY

THROUGH HER LOOSENED HAIR

SHE TRIES TO FIND THE PARTING;

IT MUST COME OUT AFTER ALL:

HIDDEN IN ALL THAT TANGLE

THERE IS A WAY.

1963

WINTER

DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD.

A BEAST OF THE MIDDLE AGES

STUPEFIED IN ITS DEN.

THE HAIRS ON ITS BODY—A WOMAN’S—

COLD AS HAIRS ON A BULB OR TUBER.

NOTHING SO BLEAKLY LEADEN YOU TELL ME

AS THE HYACINTH’S DULL CONE

BEFORE IT BULKS INTO BLUENESS.

AH BUT I’D CHOSEN TO BE

A WOMAN NOT A BEAST OR A TUBER!

NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE STORKS WENT

EVERYONE KNOWS THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED.

SOMETHING—THAT WOMAN—SEEMS TO HAVE

MIGRATED ALSO; IF SHE LIVES SHE LIVES

SEA-ZONES AWAY AND THE MEANING GROWS COLDER.

1965

ORION

FAR BACK WHEN I WENT ZIG-ZAGGING

THROUGH TAMARACK PASTURES

YOU WERE MY GENIUS YOU

MY CAST-IRON VIKING MY HELMED

LION-HEART KING IN PRISON.

YEARS LATER NOW YOU’RE YOUNG

MY FIERCE HALF-BROTHER STARING

DOWN FROM THAT SIMPLIFIED WEST

YOUR BREAST OPEN YOUR BELT DRAGGED DOWN

BY AN OLDFASHIONED THING A SWORD

THE LAST BRAVADO YOU WON’T GIVE OVER

THOUGH IT WEIGHS YOU DOWN AS YOU STRIDE

AND THE STARS IN IT ARE DIM

AND MAYBE HAVE STOPPED BURNING.

BUT YOU BURN AND I KNOW IT;

AS I THROW BACK MY HEAD TO TAKE YOU IN

AN OLD TRANSFUSION HAPPENS AGAIN:

DIVINE ASTRONOMY IS NOTHING TO IT.

INDOORS I BRUISE AND BLUNDER

BREAK FAITH LEAVE ILL ENOUGH

ALONE A DEAD CHILD BORN IN THE DARK.

NIGHT CRACKS UP OVER THE CHIMNEY

PIECES OF TIME FROZEN GEODES

COME SHOWERING DOWN IN THE GRATE.

A MAN REACHES BEHIND MY EYES

AND FINDS THEM EMPTY

A WOMAN’S HEAD TURNS AWAY

FROM MY HEAD IN THE MIRROR

CHILDREN ARE DYING MY DEATH

AND EATING CRUMBS OF MY LIFE.

PITY IS NOT YOUR FORTE.

CALMLY YOU ACHE UP THERE

PINNED ALOFT IN YOUR CROW’S NEST

MY SPEECHLESS PIRATE!

YOU TAKE IT ALL FOR GRANTED

AND WHEN I LOOK YOU BACK

IT’S WITH A STARLIKE EYE

SHOOTING ITS COLD AND EGOTISTICAL SPEAR

WHERE IT CAN DO LEAST DAMAGE.

BREATHE DEEP! NO HURT NO PARDON

OUT HERE IN THE COLD WITH YOU

YOU WITH YOUR BACK TO THE WALL.

1965

HOLDING OUT

THE HUNTERS’ SHACK WILL DO

ABANDONED UNTENDED UNMENDED

IN ITS CUL-DE-SAC OF ALDERS.

INSIDE WHO KNOWS WHAT

HOVEL-KEEPING ESSENTIALS—

A GREY SAUCEPAN A BROOM A CLOCK

STOPPED AT LAST AUTUMN’S LAST HOUR—

ALL OR ANY WHAT MATTER.

THE POINT IS IT’S A SHELTER

A PLACE MORE IN- THAN OUTSIDE.

FROM THAT WE COULD BEGIN.

AND THE WIND IS SURELY RISING

SNOW IS IN THE ALDERS.

MAYBE THE STOVEPIPE IS SOUND

MAYBE THE SMOKE WILL DO US IN

AT FIRST—NO MATTER.

LATE AFTERNOONS THE ICE

SQUEAKS UNDERFOOT LIKE MICA

AND WHEN THE SUN DROPS RED AND MOON-

FACED BACK OF THE GUN-COLORED FIRS

THE BEST INTENTIONS ARE NONE TOO GOOD.

THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A GO OF IT

IN THE SMOKE WITH THE DARK OUTSIDE

AND OUR LOVE IN OUR BOOTS AT FIRST—

NO MATTER.

1965

FLESH AND BLOOD

FOR C.

A CRACKED WALK IN THE GARDEN

WHITE VIOLETS CHOKING IN THE IVY

THEN O THEN …

EVERYONE ELSE I’VE HAD TO TELL HOW IT WAS

ONLY NOT YOU.

NERVE-WHITE THE CLOUD CAME WALKING

OVER THE CRESTS OF TALLEST TREES.

DOORS SLAMMED. WE

FELL ASLEEP HOT SUNDAYS IN OUR SLIPS

TWO MAD LITTLE GOLDFISH

FLUTTERING IN A DRYING POND.

NOBODY’S SEEN THE TROUBLE I’VE SEEN

BUT YOU.

OUR JOKES ARE FUNNIER FOR THAT

YOU’D SAY

AND LORD IT’S TRUE.

1965

IN THE EVENING

THREE HOURS CHAIN-SMOKING WORDS

AND YOU MOVE ON. WE STAND IN THE PORCH

TWO ARCHAIC FIGURES: A WOMAN AND A MAN.

THE OLD MASTERS THE OLD SOURCES

HAVEN’T A CLUE WHAT WE’RE ABOUT

SHIVERING HERE IN THE HALF-DARK ’SIXTIES.

OUR MINDS HOVER IN A FAMOUS IMPASSE

AND CLING TOGETHER. YOUR HAND

GRIPS MINE LIKE A RAILING ON AN ICY NIGHT.

THE WALL OF THE HOUSE IS BLEEDING. FIRETHORN!

THE MOON CRACKED EVERY WHICH-WAY

PUSHES STEADILY ON.

1966

MISSING THE POINT

THERE IT WAS ALL ALONG

TWISTED UP IN THAT GREEN VINE-THREAD

IN THE SKEINS OF MARBLE

ON THE TABLE BEHIND THEM—THOSE TWO!

WHITE-FACED AND UNDETERRED—

EVERYTHING DOUBLED: FORKS

BROWN GLASS TUMBLERS ECHOING PLATES

TWO CRUMBLED PORTIONS OF BREAD.

THAT WAS THE POINT THAT WAS MISSED

WHEN THEY LEFT THE ROOM WITH ITS WAVY LIGHT

AND PALE CURTAINS BLOWING

AND GUESSED THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE PICNIC

UNDER THE LEAVES WAS OVER

WHEN HAGGLING FACES PUSHED IN FOR A LOOK

AND THE GINGERBREAD VILLAGE SHRIEKED OUTSIDE:

WHO’S IN THE WRONG? WHO’S IN THE WRONG?

1966

CITY

FROM THE DUTCH OF GERRIT ACHTERBERG.

MAYBE YOU SPOKE TO SOMEONE

AND ON THAT HOUR YOUR FACE

PRINTED ITSELF FOR GOOD.

WHERE IS THAT MAN? I NEED

TO FIND HIM BEFORE HE DIES

AND SEE YOU DRIFT ACROSS HIS RETINA.

YOU HAVE PLAYED WITH CHILDREN.

THEY WILL RUN UP TO ME

WHENEVER YOU

COME HOME FREE IN THEIR DREAMS.

HOUSES REALIZED BY YOU

SLUMBER IN THAT WEB.

STREETS SUPPOSE YOU

IN OTHER STREETS AND CALL:

EVENING PAPERS …

STRAWBERRIES …

THE CITY HAS CHANGED HANDS;

THE PLAN YOU GAVE IT FALLEN THROUGH.

1962

DWINGELO

FROM THE DUTCH OF GERRIT ACHTERBERG.

IN THE NEVER STILL ARRIVING I FIND YOU

AGAIN: BLUE ABSENCE KEEPS KNOWLEDGE ALIVE

MAKES OF OCTOBER AN ADJUSTED LENS.

THE DAYS HAVE ALMOST NO CLOUDS LEFT.

CASSIOPEIA THE GREAT BEAR

LET THEIR SIGNALS BURST BY NIGHT

TO RIP INTO IMPOSSIBILITY.

THE PLEIADES RAGE SILENTLY ABOUT.

TO WAIT IS THE PASSWORD; AND TO LISTEN.

IN DWINGELO YOU CAN HEAR IT WHISPER

THE VOID IN THE RADIOTELESCOPE.

THERE TOO THE SINGING OF YOUR NERVES IS GATHERED

BECOMING GRAPHIC ON A SHEET OF PAPER

NOT UNLIKE THIS ONE HERE.

1962

THE DEMON LOVER

FATIGUE REGRETS. THE LIGHTS

GO OUT IN THE PARKING LOT

TWO BY TWO. SNOW BLINDNESS

SETTLES OVER THE SUBURB.

DESIRE. DESIRE. THE NEBULA

OPENS IN SPACE UNSEEN

YOUR HEART UTTERS ITS GREAT BEATS

IN SOLITUDE. A NEW

ERA IS COMING IN.

GAUCHE AS WE ARE IT SEEMS

WE HAVE TO PLAY OUR PART.

A PLAID DRESS SILK SCARF

AND EYES THAT GO ON STINGING.

WOMAN STAND OFF. THE AIR

GLISTENS LIKE SILK.

SHE’S GONE. IN HER PLACE STANDS

A SCHOOLGIRL MORNING LIGHT

THE HALF-GROWN BONES

OF INNOCENCE. IS SHE

YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR MUSE

THIS TREE OF BLONDNESS

GROWN UP IN A FIELD OF THORNS?

SOMETHING PIERCING AND MARRED.

TAKE NOTE. LOOK BACK. WHEN QUICK

THE WHOLE NORTHEAST WENT BLACK

AND PRISONERS HOWLED AND CHILDREN

RAN THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH CANDLES

WHO STOOD OFF MOTIONLESS

SIDE BY SIDE WHILE THE MOON SWAM UP

OVER THE DROWNED HOUSES?

WHO NEITHER TOUCHED NOR SPOKE?

WHOSE NAPE WHOSE FINGER-ENDS

NERVELESSLY LIED THE HOURS AWAY?

A VOICE PRESSES AT ME.

IF I GIVE IN IT WON’T

BE LIKE THE GIRL THE BULL RODE

ALL RUBENS FLESH AND HAPPY MOANS.

BUT TO BE WRESTLED LIKE A BOY

WITH TONGUE HIPS KNEES NERVES BRAIN …

WITH LANGUAGE?

HE DOESN’T KNOW. HE’S WATCHING

BREASTS UNDER A STRIPED BLOUSE

HIS BULL’S HEAD DOWN.

THE OLD WINE POURS AGAIN THROUGH MY VEINS.

GOODNIGHT THEN. ’NIGHT. AGAIN

WE TURN OUR BACKS AND WEARY

WEARY WE LET DOWN.

THINGS TAKE US HARD NO QUESTION.

HOW DO YOU MAKE IT ALL THE WAY

FROM HERE TO MORNING? I TOUCH

YOU MADE OF SUCH NERVE

AND FLARE AND PRIDE AND SWALLOWED TEARS.

GO HOME. COME TO BED. THE SKIES

LOOK IN AT US STERN.

AND THIS IS AN OLD STORY.

I DREAMED ABOUT THE WAR.

WE WERE ALL SITTING AT TABLE

IN A KITCHEN IN CHICAGO.

THE RADIO HAD JUST SCREAMED

THAT ILLINOIS WAS THE TARGET.

NO ONE FELT LIKE LEAVING

WE SAT BY THE OPEN WINDOW

AND TALKED IN THE SUNSET.

I’LL TELL YOU THAT JOKE TOMORROW

YOU SAID WITH YOUR SADDEST SMILE

IF I CAN REMEMBER.

THE END IS JUST A STRAW

A FEATHER FURLING SLOWLY DOWN

FLOATING TO LIGHT BY CHANCE A BREATH

ON THE LONG-LOADED SCALES.

POSTERITY TREMBLES LIKE A LEAF

AND WE GO ON MAKING HEIRS AND HEIRLOOMS.

THE WORLD WE HAVE TO MAKE IT

MY COEXISTENT FRIEND SAID LEANING

BACK IN HIS CELL.

SIBERIA VASTLY HULKS

BEHIND HIM WHICH HE DID NOT MAKE.

OH FUTILE TENDERNESS

OF TOUCH IN A WORLD LIKE THIS!

HOW MUCH LONGER DEAR CHILD

DO YOU THINK SEX WILL MATTER?

THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WEDDING

THAT NEVER WAS:

TWO CREATURES SPRUNG FREE

FROM CASTIRON COVENANTS.

INSTEAD OUR HANDS AND MINDS

EROTICALLY WAVER …

LIGHTNESS IS UNAVAILING.

CATALPAS WAVE AND SPILL

THEIR DULL STRINGS ACROSS THIS MURK OF SPRING.

I ACHE BRILLIANTLY.

ONLY WHERE THERE IS LANGUAGE IS THERE WORLD.

IN THE HARP OF MY HAIR COMPOSE ME

A SONG. DEATH’S IN THE AIR

WE ALL KNOW THAT. STILL FOR AN HOUR

I’D LIKE TO BE GAY. HOW COULD A GAY SONG GO?

WHY THAT’S YOUR SECRET AND IT SHALL BE MINE.

WE ARE OUR WORDS AND BLACK AND BRUISED AND BLUE.

UNDER OUR SKINS WE’RE LAUGHING.

IN TRISTE VERITAS?

TAKE HOLD SWEET HANDS COME ON …

BROKEN!

WHEN YOU FALTER ALL ELUDES.

THIS IS A SEASICK WAY

THIS ALMOST/NEVER TOUCHING THIS

DRAWING-OFF THIS TO-AND-FRO.

SUBTLETY STALKS IN YOUR EYES

YOUR TONGUE KNOWS WHAT IT KNOWS.

I WANT YOUR SECRETS—I WILL HAVE THEM OUT.

SEASICK I DROP INTO THE SEA.

1966

JERUSALEM

IN MY DREAM CHILDREN

ARE STONING OTHER CHILDREN

WITH BLACKENED CAROB-PODS

I DREAM MY SON IS RIDING

ON AN OLD GREY MARE

TO A HALF-DEAD WAR

ON A DEAD-GREY ROAD

THROUGH THE CACTUS AND THISTLES

AND DRIED BROOK-BEDS.

IN MY DREAM CHILDREN

ARE SWADDLED IN SMOKE

AND THEIR UNCUT HAIR SMOLDERS

EVEN HERE HERE

WHERE TREES HAVE NO SHADE

AND ROCKS HAVE NO SHADOW

TREES HAVE NO MEMORIES

ONLY THE STONES AND

THE HAIRS OF THE HEAD.

I DREAM HIS HAIR IS GROWING

AND HAS NEVER BEEN SHORN

FROM SLENDER TEMPLES HANGING

LIKE CURLS OF BARBED WIRE

AND HIS FIRST BEARD IS GROWING

SMOLDERING LIKE FIRE

HIS BEARD IS SMOKE AND FIRE

AND I DREAM HIM RIDING

PATIENTLY TO THE WAR.

WHAT I DREAM OF THE CITY

IS HOW HARD IT IS TO LEAVE

AND HOW USELESS TO WALK

OUTSIDE THE BLASTED WALLS

PICKING UP THE SHELLS

FROM A HALF-DEAD WAR

AND I WAKE UP IN TEARS

AND HEAR THE SIRENS SCREAMING

AND THE CAROB-TREE IS BARE.

BALFOUR STREET JULY 1966

CHARLESTON IN THE 1860’S

DERIVED FROM THE DIARIES OF MARY BOYKIN CHESNUT.

HE SEIZED ME BY THE WAIST AND KISSED MY THROAT …

YOUR EYES DEAR ARE THEY GREY OR BLUE

EYES OF AN ANGEL?

THE CARTS HAVE PASSED ALREADY WITH THEIR HEAPED

NIGHT-SOIL WE BREATHE AGAIN …

IS THIS WHAT WAR IS? NITRATE …

BUT SMELL THE PEAR

THE JASMINE THE VIOLETS.

WHY DOES THIS LANDSCAPE ALWAYS SADDEN YOU?

NOW THE FRESHET IS UP ON EVERY SIDE

THE RIVER COMES TO OUR DOORS

LIMBS OF PRIMEVAL TREES DIP IN THE SWAMP.

SO WE FOOL ON INTO THE BLACK

CLOUD AHEAD OF US.

EVERYTHING HUMAN GLITTERS FEVER-BRIGHT—

THE THRILL OF WAKING UP

OUT OF A STAGNANT LIFE?

THERE SEEMS A SPELL UPON

YOUR LOVERS —ALL DEAD OF WOUNDS

OR BLOWN TO PIECES … NITRATE!

I’M WRITING BLIND WITH TEARS OF RAGE.

IN VAIN. YEARS DEATH DEPOPULATION FEARS

BONDAGE—THESE SHALL ALL BE BORNE.

NO IMAGINATION TO FORESTALL WOE.

1966

NIGHT WATCH

AND NOW OUTSIDE THE WALLS

OF BLACK FLINT EYELESS.

HOW PALE IN SLEEP YOU LIE.

LOVE: MY LOVE IS JUST A BREATH

BLOWN ON THE PANE AND DISSOLVED.

EVERYTHING EVEN YOU

CRIES SILENTLY FOR HELP THE WEB

OF THE SPIDER IS RIPPED WITH RAIN

THE GEESE FLY ON INTO THE BLACK CLOUD.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

CAN THE TOUCH OF A FINGER MEND

WHAT A FINGER’S TOUCH HAS BROKEN?

BLUE-EYED NOW YELLOW-HAIRED

I STAND IN MY OLD NIGHTMARE

BESIDE THE TRACK WHILE YOU

AND OVER AND OVER AND ALWAYS YOU

PLOD INTO THE DEATHCARS.

SOMETIMES YOU SMILE AT ME

AND I—I SMILE BACK AT YOU.

HOW SWEET THE ODOR OF THE STATION-MASTER’S ROSES!

HOW PURE HOW POSTER-LIKE THE COLORS OF THIS DREAM.

1967

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS

FROM THE YIDDISH OF KADIA MOLODOWSKY.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE

WHEN A BLADE OF GRASS PUSHES UP THROUGH THE SOIL

AND THE FRESH DAWN IS A GREEN PILLOW

UNDER THE SKELETON OF A DEAD HORSE.

AND ALL THE LIMBS OF A WOMAN PLEAD FOR THE ACHE OF BIRTH.

AND WOMEN COME TO LIE DOWN LIKE SICK SHEEP

BY THE WELLS—TO HEAL THEIR BODIES

THEIR FACES BLACKENED WITH YEARLONG THIRST FOR A CHILD’S CRY.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE

WHEN LIGHTNING PIERCES THE BLACK SOIL WITH SILVER KNIVES

AND PREGNANT WOMEN APPROACH THE WHITE TABLES OF THE HOSPITAL

WITH QUIET STEPS

AND SMILE AT THE UNBORN CHILD

AND PERHAPS AT DEATH.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE

WHEN A BLADE OF GRASS PUSHES UP THROUGH THE SOIL.

1968

FOR A RUSSIAN POET

1. THE WINTER DREAM

EVERYWHERE SNOW IS FALLING. YOUR BANDAGED FOOT

DRAGS ACROSS HUGE COBBLESTONES BELLS

HAMMER IN DISTANT SQUARES.

EVERYTHING WE STOOD AGAINST HAS CONQUERED

AND NOW WE’RE PART

OF IT ALL. LIFE’S THE MAIN THING I HEAR YOU SAY

BUT A FOG IS SPREADING BETWEEN THIS LANDMASS

AND THE ONE YOUR VOICE

MAPPED SO LONG FOR ME. ALL THAT’S VISIBLE

IS WALLS ENDLESSLY YELLOW-GREY WHERE

SO MANY RISKS WERE TAKEN THE SHREDDED SKIES

SLOWLY LITTERING BOTH OUR CONTINENTS WITH

THE ONLY JUSTICE LEFT BURYING

FOOTPRINTS BELLS AND VOICES WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED.

1967

2. SUMMER IN THE COUNTRY

NOW AGAIN EVERY YEAR FOR YEARS: THE LIFE-AND-DEATH TALK

LATE AUGUST FOREBODINGS

UNDER THE BIRCHES ALONG THE WATER’S EDGE

AND BETWEEN THE TYPED LINES

AND EVENINGS TRACING A PATTERN OF ABSURD HOPES

IN BROKEN NUTSHELLS

BUT THIS YEAR WE BOTH

SIT AFTER DARK WITH THE RADIO

UNABLE TO READ UNABLE TO WRITE

TRYING THE BLURRED EDGES OF BROADCASTS

FOR A LITTLE TRUTH TAKING A WALK BEFORE BED

WONDERING WHAT A MAN CAN DO ASKING THAT

AT THE VERGE OF TEARS IN A LIGHTNING-FLASH OF LONELINESS.

3. THE DEMONSTRATION

NATALYA GORBANEVSKAYA

13/3 NOVOPESCHANAYA STREET

APARTMENT 34

AT NOON WE SIT DOWN QUIETLY ON THE PARAPET

AND UNFURL OUR BANNERS

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

THE SOUND OF POLICE WHISTLES

FROM ALL CORNERS OF RED SQUARE

WE SIT

QUIETLY AND OFFER NO RESISTANCE

IS THIS YOUR LITTLE BOY

WE WILL RELIVE THIS OVER AND OVER

THE BANNERS TORN FROM OUR HANDS

BLOOD FLOWING

A GREAT JAGGED TORN PLACE

IN THE SILENCE OF COMPLICITY

THAT MUCH AT LEAST

WE DID HERE

IN YOUR FLAT DRINKING TEA

WAITING FOR THE POLICE

YOUR CHILDREN ASLEEP WHILE YOU WRITE

QUICKLY THE LETTERS YOU WANT TO GET OFF

BEFORE TOMORROW

I’M A GHOST AT YOUR TABLE

TOUCHING POEMS IN A SCRIPT I CAN’T READ

WE’LL MEET EACH OTHER LATER

AUGUST 1968

NIGHT IN THE KITCHEN

THE REFRIGERATOR FALLS SILENT.

THEN OTHER THINGS ARE AUDIBLE:

THIS DULL SHEET-METAL MIND RATTLING LIKE STAGE THUNDER.

THE THICKNESS BUDGING FORWARD IN THESE VEINS

IS SURELY SOMETHING OTHER

THAN BLOOD:

SAY MOLTEN LAVA.

YOU WILL BECOME A BLACK LACE CLIFF FRONTING A DEADPAN SEA;

NERVES FRIABLE AS LIGHTNING

ENDING IN BURNT PINE FORESTS.

YOU ARE BEGUN BEGINNING YOUR BLACK HEART DRUMMING

SLOWLY TRIUMPHANTLY

INSIDE ITS PACIFIC CAVE.

1967

5:30 A.M.

BIRDS AND PERIODIC BLOOD.

OLD RECAPITULATIONS.

THE FOX PANTING FIRE-EYED

GONE TO EARTH IN MY CHEST.

HOW BEAUTIFUL WE ARE

HE AND I WITH OUR AUBURN

PELTS OUR TRAILS OF BLOOD

OUR MIRACLE ESCAPES

OUR WHIPLASH PANIC FLOGGING US ON

TO NEW MIRACLES!

THEY’VE SUPPLIED US WITH PILLS

FOR BLEEDING PILLS FOR PANIC.

WASH THEM DOWN THE SINK.

THIS IS TRUTH THEN:

DULL NEEDLE GROPING IN THE SPINAL FLUID

WEAK ACID IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP

FOREBODING FOREBODING.

NO ONE TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT TRUTH

THAT IT’S WHAT THE FOX

SEES FROM HIS SCUFFLED BURROW:

DULL-JAWED ONRUSHING

KILLER BEING THAT

INANELY SINGLE-MINDED

WILL HAVE OUR SKINS AT LAST.

1967

THE BREAK

ALL MONTH EATING THE HEART OUT

SMOTHERING IN A FIERCE INSOMNIA …

FIRST THE LONG SPONGY SUMMER DRYING

OUT BY FITS AND STARTS TILL A MORNING

TORN OFF ANOTHER CALENDAR

WHEN THE WIND STIFFENS CHAIRS

AND TABLES ROUSE THEMSELVES

IN A NEW UNPLANNED LIGHT

AND A WORD FLIES LIKE A DRY LEAF DOWN THE HALL

AT THE BANG OF A DOOR.

THEN BREAK OCTOBER SPEAK

NON-EXISTENT AND DAMNING CLARITY.

STARE ME DOWN THRUST

YOUR TONGUE AGAINST MINE BREAK

DAY LET ME STAND UP

LIKE A TABLE OR A CHAIR

IN A COLD ROOM WITH THE SUN BEATING IN

FULL ON THE DUSTY PANES.

1967

TWO POEMS

ADAPTED FROM ANNA AKHMATOVA.

1.

THERE’S A SECRET BOUNDARY HIDDEN IN THE WAVING GRASSES:

NEITHER THE LOVER NOR THE EXPERT SENSUALIST

PASSES IT THOUGH MOUTHS PRESS SILENTLY TOGETHER

AND THE HEART IS BURSTING.

AND FRIENDS—THEY TOO ARE HELPLESS THERE

AND SO WITH YEARS OF FIRE AND JOY

WHOLE HISTORIES OF FREEDOM

UNBURDENED BY SENSUAL LANGUOR.

THE CRAZY ONES PUSH ON TO THAT FRONTIER

WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND IT ARE SICK WITH GRIEF …

AND NOW YOU KNOW

WHY MY HEART DOESN’T BEAT BENEATH YOUR HAND.

2.

ON THE TERRACE VIOLINS PLAYED

THE MOST HEARTBREAKING SONGS.

A SHARP FRESH SMELL OF THE SEA

CAME FROM OYSTERS ON A DISH OF ICE

HE SAID I’M A FAITHFUL FRIEND

TOUCHING MY DRESS.

HOW FAR FROM A CARESS

THE TOUCH OF THAT HAND!

THE WAY YOU STROKE A CAT A BIRD

THE LOOK YOU GIVE A SHAPELY BAREBACK RIDER.

IN HIS CALM EYES ONLY LAUGHTER

UNDER THE LIGHT-GOLD LASHES.

AND THE VIOLINS MOURN ON

BEHIND DRIFTING SMOKE:

THANK YOUR STARS YOU’RE AT LAST ALONE

WITH THE MAN YOU LOVE.

1966

THE KEY

THROUGH A DRAIN GRATING SOMETHING

GLITTERS AND FALTERS

GLITTERS AGAIN. A SCRAP OF FOIL

A COIN A SIGNAL A MESSAGE

FROM THE INDISTINCT

PIERCING MY INDISTINCTNESS?

HOW LONG I HAVE GONE ROUND

AND ROUND SPIRITLESS WITH FOREKNOWN DEFEAT

IN SEARCH OF THAT GLITTER?

HOURS YEARS MAYBE. THE CRY OF METAL

ON ASPHALT ON IRON THE SUDDEN

CHING OF A PRECIOUS LOSS

THE CLEAR STATEMENT

OF SOMETHING MISSING. OVER AND OVER

IT STOPS ME IN MY TRACKS

LIKE A FALLING STAR ONLY

THIS IS NOT THE UNIVERSE’S LOSS

IT IS MINE. IF I WERE ONLY COLDER

NEARER DEATH NEARER BIRTH I MIGHT LET GO

WHATEVER’S SO BENT ON STAYING LOST.

WHY NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE

LOCKED TO COLLAPSE INWARD AMONG ITS WEEDS

THE LETTERS TO DARKEN AND FLAKE

IN THE DRAWER THE CAR

TO GROW SKELETAL AFLAME WITH RUST

IN THE MOONLIT LOT AND WALK

EVER AFTER?

O GOD I AM NOT SPIRITLESS

BUT A SPIRIT CAN BE STUNNED

A BATTERY FELT GOING DEAD

BEFORE THE LIGHT FLICKERS

AND I’VE COVERED THIS GROUND TOO OFTEN

WITH THIS YELLOW DISC

WITHIN WHOSE BEAM ALL’S COMMONPLACE

AND WHOSE LIMITS ARE DESCRIBED

BY THE WHOLE NIGHT.

1967

PICNIC

SUNDAY IN INWOOD PARK

THE PICNIC EATEN

THE CHICKEN BONES SCATTERED

FOR THE FOX WE’LL NEVER SEE

THE CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE CAVES

MY DEATH IS FOLDED IN MY POCKET

LIKE A NYLON RAINCOAT

WHAT KIND OF SUNLIGHT IS IT

THAT LEAVES THE ROCKS SO COLD?

1967

THE BOOK

FOR RICHARD HOWARD

YOU HIDING THERE IN YOUR WORDS

LIKE A DISGRACE

THE CAST-OFF SON OF A FAMILY

WHOSE FACE IS WRITTEN IN THEIRS

WHO MUST NOT BE MENTIONED

WHO CALLS COLLECT THREE TIMES A YEAR

FROM OBSCURE TOWNS OUT-OF-STATE

AND WHOSE CALLS ARE NEVER ACCEPTED

YOU WHO HAD TO LEAVE ALONE

AND FORGOT YOUR SHADOW HANGING UNDER THE STAIRS

LET ME TELL YOU: I HAVE BEEN IN THE HOUSE

I HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL OF THEM

THEY WILL NOT PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME

THEY ONLY ALLUDE TO YOU

RISING AND SITTING GOING OR COMING

FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING

GIVING AWAY IN MARRIAGE OR CALLING FOR WATER

ON THEIR DEATHBEDS

ABNEGATION

THE RED FOX THE VIXEN

DANCING IN THE HALF-LIGHT AMONG THE JUNIPERS

WISE-LOOKING IN A SEXY WAY

EGYPTIAN-SUPPLE IN HER SHARPNESS—

WHAT DOES SHE WANT

WITH THE DREAMS OF DEAD VIXENS

THE APOTHEOSIS OF REYNARD

THE LITERATURE OF FOX-HUNTING?

ONLY IN HER NERVES THE PAST

SINGS A THRILL OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

I GO ALONG DOWN THE ROAD

TO A HOUSE NAILED TOGETHER BY SCOTTISH

COVENANTERS INSTINCT MORTIFIED

IN A VIRGIN FOREST

AND SHE SPRINGS TOWARD HER DEN

EVERY HAIR ON HER PELT ALIVE

WITH TIDINGS OF THE IMMACULATE PRESENT.

THEY LEFT ME A WESTERNNESS

A BIRTHRIGHT A REDSTAINED RAVELLED

AFGHAN OF SKY.

SHE HAS NO ARCHIVES

NO HEIRLOOMS NO FUTURE

EXCEPT DEATH

AND I COULD BE MORE

FOR C.R.G.

MY THREE SISTERS ARE SITTING

ON ROCKS OF BLACK OBSIDIAN.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS LIGHT I CAN SEE WHO THEY ARE.

MY FIRST SISTER IS SEWING HER COSTUME FOR THE PROCESSION.

SHE IS GOING AS THE TRANSPARENT LADY

AND ALL HER NERVES WILL BE VISIBLE.

MY SECOND SISTER IS ALSO SEWING

AT THE SEAM OVER HER HEART WHICH HAS NEVER HEALED ENTIRELY.

AT LAST SHE HOPES THIS TIGHTNESS IN HER CHEST WILL EASE.

MY THIRD SISTER IS GAZING

AT A DARK-RED CRUST SPREADING WESTWARD FAR OUT ON THE SEA.

HER STOCKINGS ARE TORN BUT SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

TAKE THE WORD

OF MY PULSE LOVING AND ORDINARY

SEND OUT YOUR SIGNALS HOIST

YOUR DARK SCRIBBLED FLAGS

BUT TAKE

MY HAND

ALL WARS ARE USELESS TO THE DEAD

MY HANDS ARE KNOTTED IN THE ROPE

AND I CANNOT SOUND THE BELL

MY HANDS ARE FROZEN TO THE SWITCH

AND I CANNOT THROW IT

THE FOOT IS IN THE WHEEL

WHEN IT’S FINISHED AND WE’RE LYING

IN A STUBBLE OF BLISTERED FLOWERS

I DON’T SEE YOUR EYES

THEY LOOK OFF FROM MEINTO THE EYES

OF RATS AND HAUNTED POLICEMEN.

WHAT I SEE BEST IS THE LENGTH

OF YOUR FINGERS

PRESSING THE PENCIL

INTO THE BARRED PAGE

OF THE FRENCH CHILD’S COPYBOOK

WITH ITS CARTESIAN SQUARESITS GRILLED

TRAP OF HOLY GEOMETRY

WHERE YOUR NIGHT-SWEATS STREAMED OUT

PLASTIC BATHROOM CUP LAST NIGHT—

NO USE EXCEPT FOR WHAT YOU CAN GET WITH IT.

YET SOMETHING WANTS US DELIVERED UP

ALIVE WHATEVER IT IS

THAT CAUSES ME TO EDGE THE SLATTED BLIND

SOUNDLESSLY UP LEAVING YOU

TEN MINUTES’ MORE SLEEP WHILE I LOOK

SHIVERING LUCIDIFYING DOWN

AT THAT STREET WHERE THE POOR ARE ALREADY GETTING STARTED

AND THAT POSTER STREAKING THE OPPOSITE WALL

WITH THE BLURRED FACE OF A SINGER WHOSE SONGS

MONEY CAN’T BUY NOR AIR CONTAIN

SOMEONE YET UNLOVED WHOSE VOICE

I MAY NEVER HEAR BUT GO ON HOPING

TO HEAR TONIGHT TOMORROW SOMEDAY

AS I GO ON HOPING TO FEEL

TEARS OF MERCY IN THE OF COURSE IMPERSONAL RAIN.

1968

ON EDGES

WHEN THE ICE STARTS TO SHIVER

ALL ACROSS THE REFLECTING BASIN

OR WATER-LILY LEAVES

DISSECT A SIMPLE SURFACE

THE WORD ‘DROWNING’ FLOWS THROUGH ME.

YOU BUILT A GLASSY FLOOR

THAT HELD ME

AS I LEANED TO FISH FOR OLD

HOOKS AND TOOTHED TIN CANS

STEMS LASHING OUT LIKE TIES OF

SILK DRESSING-GOWNS

ARCHANGELS OF LAKE-LIGHT

GRIPPED IN MUD.

NOW YOU HAND ME A TORN LETTER.

ON MY KNEES IN THE ASHES I COULD NEVER

FIT THESE RIPPED-UP FLAKES TOGETHER.

IN THE TAXI I AM STILL PIECING

WHAT SYLLABLES I CAN

TRANSLATING AT TOP SPEED LIKE A THINKING MACHINE

THAT TYPES OUT ‘USELESS’ AS ‘MONSTER’

AND ‘HISTORY’ AS ‘LAMPSHADE’.

CROSSING THE BRIDGE I NEED ALL MY NERVE

TO TRUST TO THE MAN-MADE CABLES.

THE BLADES ON THAT MACHINE

COULD CUT YOU TO RIBBONS

BUT ITS FUNCTION IS HUMANE.

IS THIS ALL I CAN SAY OF THESE

DELICATE HOOKS SCYTHE-CURVED INTENTIONS

YOU AND I HANDLE? I’D RATHER

TASTE BLOOD YOURS OR MINE FLOWING

FROM A SUDDEN SLASH THAN CUT ALL DAY

WITH BLUNT SCISSORS ON DOTTED LINES

LIKE THE TEACHER TOLD.

VIOLENCE

NO ONE KNOWS YET

WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF. THUS: IF YOU

(STILL DRAWING ME MOUTH TO MOUTH

TOWARD THE DOOR) HAD PUSHED

A GUN INTO MY HAND

WOULD MY FINGERS HAVE BURNED OR NOT

TO DRY ICE ON THAT METAL?

IF YOU’D SAID LEAVING

IN A PRE-DAWN THUNDERSTORM

USE THIS WHEN THE TIME COMES

WOULD I HAVE BLURTED MY FIRST NO THAT NIGHT

OR BACK WITHOUT YOU BUNDLED

THE COLD BULK INTO A DRAWER

IN A COCOON OF NIGHTGOWNS

PRINTED WITH KNOTS OF HONEYSUCKLE …

STILL FOLLOWING YOU AS IF YOUR BODY

WERE A LANTERN AN ANGEL OF RADAR

ALONG THE UNTRUSTWORTHY PARK

OR DOWN THAT BLOCK WHERE THE COPS SHOOT TO KILL—

COULD I HAVE DREAMED A VIOLENCE

BLACK VEINS OF ICE ON THE PANE

TURNING OFF AND ON

THIS SEASICK NEON

THE STEAMER EDGING IN TOWARD THE PENAL COLONY

CHAINED MEN DOZING ON DECK

FIVE FOREST FIRES LIGHTING THE ISLAND

LIFELONG THAT GLARE WAITING.

AS YOU SPEAK OF CHE GUEVARA

BOLIVIA NANTERRE

I’M TOO YOUNG TO BE YOUR MOTHER

YOU’RE TOO YOUNG TO BE MY BROTHER

YOUR TEARS ARE NOT POLITICAL

THEY ARE REAL WATER BURNING

AS THE TEARS OF TELEMACHUS

BURNED

OVER SPANISH HARLEM THE MOON

SWELLS UP A FIRE BALLOON

FIRE GNAWING THE EDGE

OF THIS CRUSHED-UP NEWSPAPER

AND THE DEATH COLUMNS BLACKEN

WE’RE FIGHTING FOR A SLASH OF RECOGNITION

A PIERCING TO THE PIERCED HEART.

TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH—

BUT THE ATTENTION FLICKERS

AND WILL FLICKER

A MATCHFLAME IN POISON AIR

ACRE BLOODCAKED LIONHEARTED

RAW VOMIT CURDLING IN THE SUN

GRAY WALKERS WALKING

STRAYING WITH A CURBED INTENTNESS

IN AND OUT THE INCLOSURES

THE GALLOWS THE PHOTOGRAPHS

OF DEAD JEWISH TERRORISTS AGED 15

THEIR FADING FACES WIDE-EYED

AND OUT IN THE CRUSADING SUNLIGHT

GRAY STRAYERS STILL STRAYING

DUSTY PATHS

THE MAD WHO LIVE IN THE DRIED-UP MOAT

WHAT ARE WE COMING TO

WHAT WANTS THESE THINGS OF US

WHO WANTS THEM

THE STRAIN OF BEING BORN

OVER AND OVER HAS TORN YOUR SMILE INTO PIECES

OFTEN I HAVE SEEN IT BROKEN

AND THEN RE-MEMBERED

AND WONDERED HOW A BEAUTY

SO ANARCH SO UNGELDED

WILL BE CARED FOR IN THIS WORLD.

I WANT TO HAND YOU THIS

LEAFLET STREAMING WITH RAIN OR TEARS

BUT THE WORDS COMING CLEAR

SOMETHING YOU MIGHT FIND CRUSHED INTO YOUR HAND

AFTER PASSING A BARRICADE

AND STUFF IN YOUR RAINCOAT POCKET.

I WANT THIS TO REACH YOU

WHO TOLD ME ONCE THAT POETRY IS NOTHING SACRED

NO MORE SACRED THAT IS

THAN OTHER THINGS IN YOUR LIFE—

TO ANSWER YES IF LIFE IS UNCORRUPTED

NO BETTER POETRY IS WANTED.

I WANT THIS TO BE YOURS

IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU FIND AND READ IT

IT WILL BE THERE IN YOU ALREADY

AND THE LEAFLET THEN MERELY SOMETHING

TO LEAVE BEHIND A LITTLE LEAF

IN THE DRAWER OF A SUBLET ROOM.

WHAT ELSE DOES IT COME DOWN TO

BUT HANDING ON SCRAPS OF PAPER

LITTLE FIGURINES OR PHIALS

NO STRONGER THAN THE DRY CLAY THEY ARE BAKED IN

YET MORE THAN DRY CLAY OR PAPER

BECAUSE THE IMAGINATION CROUCHES IN THEM.

IF WE NEEDED FIRE TO REMIND US

THAT ALL TRUE IMAGES

WERE SCOOPED OUT OF THE MUD

WHERE OUR BODIES CURSE AND FLOUNDER

THEN PERHAPS THAT FIRE IS COMING

TO SPONGE AWAY THE SCRIBES AND TIME-SERVERS

AND MUCH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED WILL BE LOST AS WELL

BEFORE YOU COULD HANDLE IT AND KNOW IT

JUST AS WE ALMOST MISS EACH OTHER

IN THE ILL CLOUD OF MISTRUST WHO MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED

HANDS QUICKLY SHARED FOOD OR GIVEN BLOOD

FOR EACH OTHER. I AM THINKING HOW WE CAN USE WHAT WE HAVE

TO INVENT WHAT WE NEED.

BLURRED RED RAG OLD BANDAGES RIBBONS

THEN I SPRAWLED

FULL LENGTH ON THE LASHED POLES

LAUGHING DRENCHED IN RAGS.

THE RIVER’S RISING!

THEY YELLED ON SHORE

THRU MEGAPHONES.

CAN’T YOU SEE

THAT WATER’S MAD THOSE RAFTS

ARE CHILDREN’S TOYS THAT CROWD

IS HEADING NOWHERE?

MY LIPS

TASTED YOUR LIPS AND FOREHEADS

SALTY WITH SWEAT

THEN WE WERE LAUGHING HOLDING OFF

FOR SHEILA ROTNER

THE CLOUDS ARE ELECTRIC IN THIS UNIVERSITY.

THE LOVERS ASTRIDE THE TRACTOR BURN FISSURES THROUGH THE HAY.

WHEN I LOOK AT THAT WALL I SHALL THINK OF YOU

AND OF WHAT YOU DID NOT PAINT THERE.

ONLY THE TRUTH MAKES THE PAIN OF LIFTING A HAND WORTHWHILE:

THE PRISM STAGGERING UNDER THE BLOWS OF THE RAGA.

THE VANISHING-POINT IS THE POINT WHERE HE APPEARS.

TWO PARALLEL TRACKS CONVERGE YET THERE HAS BEEN NO WRECK.

TO MUTILATE PRIVACY WITH A SINGLE FOOLISH SYLLABLE

IS TO THROW AWAY THE SEARCH FOR THE ONE NECESSARY WORD.

WHEN YOU READ THESE LINES THINK OF ME

AND OF WHAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN HERE.

7/13/68

THE ONES WHO CAMPED ON THE SLOPES BELOW THE BARE SUMMIT

SAW DIFFERENTLY FROM US WHO BREATHED THIN AIR AND KEPT WALKING.

SLEEPING BACK-TO-BACK MAN AND WOMAN WE WERE MORE CONSCIOUS

THAN EITHER OF US AWAKE AND ALONE IN THE WORLD.

THESE WORDS ARE VAPOR-TRAILS OF A PLANE THAT HAS VANISHED;

BY THE TIME I WRITE THEM OUT THEY ARE WHISPERING SOMETHING ELSE.

DO WE STILL HAVE TO FEEL JEALOUS OF OUR CREATIONS?

ONCE THEY MIGHT HAVE OUTLIVED US; IN THIS WORLD WE’LL DIE TOGETHER.

DON’T LOOK FOR ME IN THE ROOM I HAVE LEFT;

THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS JUST A WHITE ROCKING-CHAIR STILL ROCKING.

7/14/68: I

IN CENTRAL PARK WE TALKED OF OUR OWN COWARDICE.

HOW MANY TIMES A DAY IN THIS CITY ARE THOSE WORDS SPOKEN?

THE TEARS OF THE UNIVERSE AREN’T ALL STARS DANTON;

SOME ARE SATELLITES OF BRUSHED ALUMINUM AND STAINLESS STEEL.

HE WHO WAS TEMPORARY HAS JOINED ETERNITY;

HE HAS DESERTED US GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

IN THE THEATRE OF THE DUST NO ACTOR BECOMES FAMOUS.

IN THE LAST SCENE THEY ALL ARE BLOWN AWAY LIKE DUST.

“IT MAY BE IF I HAD KNOWN THEM I WOULD HAVE LOVED THEM.”

YOU WERE AMERICAN WHITMAN AND THOSE WORDS ARE YOURS.

7/14/68: II

DID YOU THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE?

I WAS TRYING TO DRIVE A TRADITION UP AGAINST THE WALL.

THE FIELD THEY BURNED OVER IS GREENER THAN ALL THE REST.

YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT HE SAID THE SPARKS CAN TRAVEL THE ROOTS.

SHOT BACK INTO THIS EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE

OUR CHILDREN’S CHILDREN MAY PHOTOGRAPH THESE STONES.

IN THE RED WASH OF THE DARKROOM I SEE MYSELF CLEARLY;

WHEN THE PRINT IS DEVELOPED AND HANDED ABOUT THE FACE IS

NOTHING TO ME.

FOR US THE WORK UNDOES ITSELF OVER AND OVER:

THE GRASS GROWS BACK THE DUST COLLECTS THE SCAR BREAKS OPEN.

7/16/68: I

BLACKED-OUT ON A WAGON PART OF MY LIFE CUT OUT FOREVER—

FIVE GREEN HOURS AND FORTY VIOLET MINUTES.

A COLD SPRING SLOWED OUR LILACS TILL A SURF BROKE

VIOLET/WHITE TENDER AND SENSUAL MISREAD IT IF YOU DARE.

I TELL YOU TRUTH IS AT THE MOMENT HERE

BURNING OUTWARD THROUGH OUR SKINS.

ETERNITY STREAMS THROUGH MY BODY:

TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HAND AND SEE.

TILL THE WALLS OF THE TUNNEL CAVE IN

AND THE BLACK RIVER WALKS ON OUR FACES.

7/16/68: II

WHEN THEY MOW THE FIELDS I SEE THE WORLD REFORMED

AS IF BY SNOW OR FIRE OR PHYSICAL DESIRE.

FIRST SNOW. DEATH OF THE CITY. GHOSTS IN THE AIR.

YOUR SHADE AMONG THE SHADOWS INTERVIEWING THE MIST.

THE MAIL CAME EVERY DAY BUT LETTERS WERE MISSING;

BY THIS I KNEW THINGS WERE NOT WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE.

THE TREES IN THE LONG PARK BLURRING BACK

INTO OLMSTED’S ORIGINAL DREAM-WORK.

THE IMPARTIAL SCHOLAR WRITES ME FROM UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

I HOPE YOU ARE ROTTING IN HELL MONTAIGNE YOU BASTARD.

ARMITAGE OF SCRAPIRON FOR THE RADIATIONS OF A MOON.

FLOWER CAST IN METAL PICASSO-WOMAN SISTER.

TWO HESITANT LUNA MOTHS REGARD EACH OTHER

WITH THE SPOTS ON THEIR WINGS: FASCINATED.

TO RESIGN YOURSELF—WHAT AN ACT OF BETRAYAL!

—TO THROW A RUNAWAY SPIRIT BACK TO THE DOGS.

WHEN THE EBB-TIDE PULLS HARD ENOUGH WE ARE ALL STARFISH.

THE MOON HAS HER WAY WITH US MY COMPANION IN CRIME.

AT THE AQUARIUM THAT DAY BETWEEN THE WHITE WHALE’S LONELINESS

AND THE GROUPERS’ MASS PROMISCUITIES ONLY OURSELVES.

7/23/68

WHEN YOUR SPERM ENTERS ME IT IS ALTERED;

WHEN MY THOUGHT ABSORBS YOURS A WORLD BEGINS.

IF THE MIND OF THE TEACHER IS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE MIND OF THE STUDENT

HE IS SIMPLY PRACTICING RAPE AND DESERVES AT BEST OUR PITY.

TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE LAW! OR BARELY WITHIN IT

A TWIG ON BOILING WATERS ENCLOSED INSIDE A BUBBLE

OUR WORDS ARE JAMMED IN AN ELECTRONIC JUNGLE;

SOMETIMES THOUGH THEY RISE AND WHEEL CROAKING ABOVE THE TREETOPS.

AN OPEN WINDOW; THICK SUMMER NIGHT; ELECTRIC FENCES TRILLING.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE DEATH-CAMPS VIVALDI?

7/24/68: I

THE SAPLING SPRINGS THE MILKWEED BLOOMS: OBSOLETE NATURE.

IN THE WOODS I HAVE A VISION OF ASPHALT BLINDLY LINGERING.

I HARDLY KNOW THE NAMES OF THE WEEDS I LOVE.

I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAMES OF SO MANY FLOWERS.

I CAN’T LIVE AT THE HEMS OF THAT TRADITION—

WILL I LAST TO TRY THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT?

KILLING IS DIFFERENT NOW: NO FINGERS ROUND THE THROAT.

NO ONE FEELS THE WETNESS OF THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.

WHEN WE FUCK THERE TOO ARE WE REMOTER

THAN THE FUCKING BODIES OF LOVERS USED TO BE?

HOW MANY MEN HAVE TOUCHED ME WITH THEIR EYES

MORE HOTLY THAN THEY LATER TOUCHED ME WITH THEIR LIPS.

7/24/68: II

THE FRIEND I CAN TRUST IS THE ONE WHO WILL LET ME HAVE MY DEATH.

THE REST ARE ACTORS WHO WANT ME TO STAY AND FURTHER THE PLOT.

AT THE DRIVE-IN MOVIE ABOVE THE PANAVISION

BEYOND THE PROJECTOR BEAMS YOU PROJECT YOURSELF GREAT STAR.

THE EYE THAT USED TO WATCH US IS DEAD BUT OPEN.

SOMETIMES I STILL HAVE A SENSE OF BEING FOLLOWED.

HOW LONG WILL WE BE WAITING FOR THE POLICE?

HOW LONG MUST I WONDER WHICH OF MY FRIENDS WOULD HIDE ME?

DRIVING AT NIGHT I FEEL THE MILKY WAY

STREAMING ABOVE ME LIKE THE GRAPH OF A CRY.

7/26/68: I

LAST NIGHT YOU WROTE ON THE WALL: REVOLUTION IS POETRY.

TODAY YOU NEEDN’T WRITE; THE WALL HAS TUMBLED DOWN.

WE WERE TAUGHT TO RESPECT THE APPEARANCE BEHIND THE REALITY.

OUR SENSES WERE OUT ON PAROLE UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

A PAIR OF EYES IMPRISONED FOR YEARS INSIDE MY SKULL

IS BURNING ITS WAY OUTWARD THE HEADACHES ARE TERRIBLE.

I’M WALKING THROUGH A RUBBLE OF BROKEN SCULPTURE STUMBLING

HERE ON THE SPINE OF A FRIEND THERE ON THE HAND OF A BROTHER.

ALL THOSE JOININGS! AND YET WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO BE UNIQUE.

NEITHER ALONE NOR IN ANYONE’S ARMS WILL WE END UP SLEEPING.

7/26/68: II

A DEAD MOSQUITO FLATTENED AGAINST A DOOR;

HIS IMAGE COULD SURVIVE OUR COMINGS AND OUR GOINGS.

LEROI! ELDRIDGE! LISTEN TO US WE ARE GHOSTS

CONDEMNED TO HAUNT THE CITIES WHERE YOU WANT TO BE AT HOME.

THE WHITE CHILDREN TURN BLACK ON THE NEGATIVE.

THE SUMMER CLOUDS BLACKEN INSIDE THE CAMERA-SKULL.

EVERY MISTAKE THAT CAN BE MADE WE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE;

ANYTHING LESS WOULD FALL SHORT OF THE REALITY WE’RE DREAMING.

SOMEONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN DESPERATE NOW IT’S OUR TURN—

WE WHO WERE FREE TO WEEP FOR OTHELLO AND LAUGH AT CALIBAN.

I HAVE LEARNED TO SMELL A CONSERVATEUR A MILE AWAY:

THEY CARRY ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUES OF ALL THAT THERE IS TO LOSE.

7/26/68: III

SO MANY MINDS IN SEARCH OF BODIES

GROPING THEIR WAY AMONG ARTIFICIAL LIMBS.

OF LATE THEY WRITE ME HOW THEY ARE GETTING ON:

DESERTION DESERTION IS THE STORY OF THOSE PAGES.

A CHEWED-UP NAIL THE PAST SPLITTING YET GROWING

THE SAME AND NOT THE SAME; A NERVOUS HABIT NEVER SHAKEN.

THOSE STAYS OF TOOLED WHALEBONE IN THE SALEM MUSEUM—

EROTIC SCRIMSHAW PRACTICAL EVEN IN LUST.

WHOEVER THOUGHT OF INSERTING A SHIP IN A BOTTLE?

LONG WEEKS WITHOUT WOMEN DO THIS TO A MAN.

8/1/68

THE ORDER OF THE SMALL TOWN ON THE RIVERBANK

FOREVER AT WAR WITH THE ORDER OF THE DARK AND STARLIT SOUL.

WERE YOU FREE THEN ALL ALONG JIM FREE AT LAST

OF EVERYTHING BUT THE WHITE BOY’S FANTASIES?

WE PLEADED GUILTY TILL WE SAW WHAT RECTITUDE WAS LIKE:

ITS WASHED HANDS AND DEAD NERVE AND SCLEROTIC EYE.

I LONG AGO STOPPED DREAMING OF PURE JUSTICE YOUR HONOR—

MY CRIME WAS TO BELIEVE WE COULD MAKE CRUELTY OBSOLETE.

THE BODY HAS BEEN EXHUMED FROM THE BURNT-OUT BUNKER;

THE TEETH COUNTED THE CONTENTS OF THE STOMACH TOLD OVER.

AND YOU CUSTER THE SQUAW-KILLER HERO OF PRIMITIVE SCHOOLROOMS—

WHERE ARE YOU BURIED WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF YOUR BONES?

8/4/68

FOR AIJAZ AHMAD

IF THESE ARE LETTERS THEY WILL HAVE TO BE MISREAD.

IF SCRIBBLINGS ON A WALL THEY MUST TANGLE WITH ALL THE OTHERS.

FUCK REDSBLACK POWERANGEL LOVES ROSITA

—AND A TRANSISTOR RADIO ANSWERS IN SPANISH: NIGHT MUST FALL.

PRISONERS SOLDIERS CROUCHING AS ALWAYS WRITING

EXPLAINING THE UNFORGIVABLE TO A WIFE A MOTHER A LOVER.

THOSE FACES ARE BLURRED AND SOME HAVE TURNED AWAY

TO WHICH I USED TO ADDRESS MYSELF SO HOTLY.

HOW IS IT GHALIB THAT YOUR GRIEF RESURRECTED IN PIECES

HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO THIS ROOM FROM YOUR DARK HOUSE IN DELHI?

WHEN THEY READ THIS POEM OF MINE THEY ARE TRANSLATORS.

EVERY EXISTENCE SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OF ITS OWN.

8/8/68: I

FROM HERE ON ALL OF US WILL BE LIVING

LIKE GALILEO TURNING HIS FIRST TUBE AT THE STARS.

OBEY THE LITTLE LAWS AND BREAK THE GREAT ONES

IS THE PREAMBLE TO THEIR CONSTITUTION.

EVEN TO HOPE IS TO LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN

UNDER THE MOCKING EYES OF THE WAY THINGS ARE.

THERE’S A WAR ON EARTH AND IN THE SKULL AND IN THE GLASSY SPACES

BETWEEN THE EXISTING AND THE NON-EXISTING.

I NEED TO LIVE EACH DAY THROUGH HAVE THEM AND KNOW THEM ALL

THOUGH I CAN SEE FROM HERE WHERE I’LL BE STANDING AT THE END.

8/8/68: II

FOR A.H.C.

A PIECE OF THREAD RIPPED-OUT FROM A FIERCE DESIGN

SOME WEAVING FIGURED AS MAGIC AGAINST OPPRESSION.

I’M SPEAKING TO YOU AS A WOMAN TO A MAN:

WHEN YOUR BLOOD FLOWS I WANT TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS.

HOW DID WE GET CAUGHT UP FIGHTING THIS FOREST FIRE

WE WHO WERE ONLY LOOKING FOR A STILL PLACE IN THE WOODS?

HOW FRAIL WE ARE AND YET DISPERSED ALWAYS RETURNING

THE BARNACLES THEY KEEP SCRAPING FROM THE WARSHIP’S HULL.

THE HAIRS ON YOUR BREAST CURL SO LIGHTLY AS YOU LIE THERE

WHILE THE STRONG HEART GOES ON POUNDING IN ITS SLEEP.
